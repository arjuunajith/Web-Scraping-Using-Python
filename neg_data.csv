"Rockstar: Here's GTAV for the PS4 and Xbox One!

Everyone: OH SHIT!!!!!!!

Rockstar: Here's GTAV for the PS5 and Xbox Series X!

Everyone: Shit........."
"Guys I think they just wanted to match the sequel numbers on title, gta 5 and ps 5.

I realized how stupid this reads but I'll keep it cuz I'm an idiot"
Too bad the game really sucks now
*EA enters the game with FUT*
"Think they're going to ask people to buy their game again?... After typing that out, it seems like a stupid question."
Stop Buying the game!!!  If you stop buying it they will stop selling it!!!
I still can’t get over how god awful the GTA V story was. None of the characters were interesting at all. I’ve played through all the other GTA stories at least 2 or 3 times but never replayed GTAV. The characters were so unrealistic and boring that it just made me want to stop
"Hey guys, we're selling a game from not one but TWO console generations ago!"
Todd Howard has them beaten there by a fucking mile.
"So people bought gta v for ps3, ps4 and now ps5 separately? WTF is this shit?"
Yeah but Rockstar doesn’t charge extra for its updates. They’re not like other pathetic devs that nickel and dime begging and milking users for “sub fees.”
"GTA V - 7

Skyrim - 7

Resident Evil 4 - 12

Doom - 18"
You paid 60$ for the base ps3 game. 60$ PS4 graphics DLC and again PS5 graphics DLC for 60$. 180 friggin $ for the same game holly shit
Yes unfortunately
"Yeah man, why don't one of them just sits down before lunch and creates gta6.exe in 10 minutes and just release it? Fucking rockstar /s"
I'm sorry but yurt telling me you wouldnt want to play dead space 2 or 3 in 4k
"I was in highschool when they game came out, I'm an oldmen now."
Resident Evil 4 laughs at both.
Oh shit. Their both game number 5!!
Fuck can they run
Bad Company 2 remaster when
8 years is plenty of time to develop a game bruh
Don't give me false hope
"Not worth it then, online got boring in less than a day. Fully don't understand what's wrong in the head of people who play it so much."
"Think I'll pass, I hate the online."
"Yeah but like by that logic cyberpunk 2077 is a 2013 game

https://youtu.be/DvVjkqB3LH0"
"I was in high school when III came out. My dad tried to confiscate my video games for being too violent and vulgar, but he listened to Clarence Carter."
People are blaming Rockstar. Blame the idiots who buy shark cards.
"I don't play the online either but what is the point of ""I don't understand why people like things I don't""?  Are you seriously that ego-centric?"
The mods thing is fucked up. I had an easier time managing mods with vortex and a cracked version than I did when I [re]bought it for PC and used their in house system. Infuriating.
"I was wondering who spent money on Star Citizen.

"Don't worry Mr. President. You still have Ray Ciccarelli, infamous NASCAR loser."
Do all you non sports fans realize he's hated the NFL for 40 years? He's never been a friend of the NFL.
"I've said it before and I'll say it again any time this subject comes up; *I* don't give a flying fuck what you do during the national anthem, but [this fucking guy has no right to whine about being disrespectful.](https://youtu.be/Uxd_S1WHRCw)"
"nascar was founded on ""fuck the police"""
His Base will still vote for him and if the EVIL=GOP can suppress enough votes game over
"I think they are intentionally playing into his reelection bid. No Confederate flag, blacks kneeling at NFL games. The point is to whip his base into a frenzy."
There’s his weird posture again
"Gee, that’s too bad."
NASCAR just placated to BLM and shit all over its fan base AGAIN
If him unable to lift a glass of water is anything to indicate
"Imagine seeing that players are kneeling at every NFL game, then buying tickets and acting shocked and appalled that people are kneeling. 

It sounds like the actions of an incredibly stupid individual, but it’s our Vice President."
"He should be asked about that ridiculous, embarrassing, and expensive stunt every time he addresses the media."
Racist Carelli you mean
It's true. I know a couple of people who work at NASCAR who take calls regularly(they work in sales) from angry people who hate the flag ban.
"""top-tier""

NASCAR would not give a fuck if he was in the bottom 90%."
His followers turned on T Swift once they realized she wasn't the secret racist Aryan princess they fantasized her to be.
I think you underestimate the stupid loyalty of his cult
"What do you mean, if? I guarantee he will go nuclear on Twitter."
I fuckin forgot about James Woods. Man I hate that guy.
"> Imagine seeing that players are kneeling at every NFL game, then buying tickets and acting shocked and appalled that people are kneeling.

To improve social distancing they should add an intermission between the anthem and kickoff and sell two batches of tickets: leave-early-in-outrage tickets and watch-the-game tickets."

"I think Kanye has hated the Democrats ever since Obama called him a Jackass.  Kanye West's ego is fragile enough, and he is stupid enough for that to turn the tide."
Disappointed!
"Kanye is a mystery. He clearly suffers with being bi-polar, but the idea of him using Trump isn't inconceivable either."
">I tend to believe that this is not set in stone.


Dixie Chicks. At least swift is out of the country game so losing republicans doesn't matter"
These violent delights have violent ends.
I wouldn't be so sure. Hitler was really sad when Charlie Chaplin made a movie about how evil he was. Hitler proceeded to invade Poland.
This is a prime example of “Chaotic Stupid.”
"They're fucked up for the rest of their life, because they were attracted to the cult to get answers about a pain inside them that they just want to ignore."
It shows their ignorance. Swift went through a sexual assault trial and Trump has a terrible record with women. All they see was her being blonde and blue-eyed and ran with the assumption. And then they had the gall to be mad at her when their wishful thinking turned out to be false.
That is one sad woman. It *almost* makes me feel sorry for her.
He was in on the joke. I think he doesn’t take himself as seriously as you think
"Taking on the hate of half the country to save the lives of a few *would* be a Yeezus move, I wanna believe (but godddd he said so much dumb stuff I don’t know)"
"""There's no such thing as bad publicity?"""
"Woods knows that Trump is lying.

It's called being *evil*."
Or its just a discussion of ideas and you seem to be struggling with the erroneous and narrow belief of support vs non-committed banter.
They were mad as hell and didn't have time to go 'round and 'round and 'round.

When did that sorry fuck turn confederate loser?
God I didn't think I'd see his stupid ass again
This is insulting to excrement.
This is fucking disgusting
USA is a disgusting place.
America is so fucked up.
Something is so wrong out there
I’m sorry can anyone explain what he did
"Dude that identifies as Hispanic wearing a shirt with the flag that is repped by racists who hate Hispanics. We are truly in bizarro world. If it wasn’t bad enough that he killed an unarmed kid, he’s now espousing white supremacy while he is literally a person of color whose racial identity is hated by the very people he “supports”."
This is not America. This is an evil person who lives in America. Zimmerman is a disgusting individual and the overwhelming majority of Americans agree that this is vile.
What’s behind the skittles?
"He did not murder him. Although what he’s doing now is wrong, evidence backed up the fact he was ruthlessly beat before being able to draw his weapon and fire.

There’s a reason he was released and that reason is that there was no evidence of murder and plenty of self defense."
It just goes to show you that race doesn't matter so long as we can come together as one and spread hate
"He also has a few cases of domestic violence and pointing guns at people, but they all seem to get dropped..... read the wiki it’s insane this guy still is walking around."
Yes. Disturbingly yes.
"He used the archaic “Stand Your Ground” law, infamous in backwards Florida. He claimed he was a neighborhood watch person. He shot the unarmed Trevon Martin after the kid was heading home from 7/11. Trevon had bought some Skittles."
"Yeh so you sign skittles and mock and profit off the death? There’s getting pissed off and there’s being a sick, twisted fuck. The way he behaved afterwards makes your whole theory bullshit"
That’s fucked up
That's sickening.
"It was sour Skittles and an Arizona iced tea :( I remember so specifically because when it happened, everyone in my class bought the same items in, like, memorial. It was really sad."
Justice would mean prison you mean revenge.
In the fucking street too. Not even on his property.
"Other comments pointed out that was false, so it might still be sitting on a mantle unfortunately."
"Sick fucks the lot of them. Attack someone, make them uncomfortable and when they do the insane thing of not submitting to your violence , kill them and claim self defense. Sick sick fucks.

Also the person you replied to is such a massive loser because they start their comment with “downvote time”

I fucking hate people who call out that they’ll get downvotes as though it’s some badge of honor. I don’t know why it makes me so annoyed but I feel confident in saying they’re the absolute worst."
"Yes, that is wrong"
">Imagine being a black teenager visiting relatives and having a random guy stalk you and attack you on your way back from the fucking CVS 

Martin had to imagine this as well, because this never happened. Zimmerman did not attack him at all."
"Yes yea you literally fucking do

Being followed does not warrant smashing someone's head onto a pavement"
Right? Skittles are disgusting.
"If they’re broken, throw ‘em out with the rest of the garbage."
What the hell. Of course it's wrong?
Grown men that need to carry a gun to feel tough are weak.
You're either a racist or a psychopath. rather you had died than that kid you're a sick fucking waste of air.
"I'd kick his ass too if he were stalking me and trying to cause trouble, gotta defend myself. Zimmerman didn't have to follow the kid like that, and he didn't have to pull a gun and murder him. Fuck that guy and everything about him."
">the kid started beating him up for being suspected

You mean he started beating him up after being followed by a stranger. Seems like he was trying to defend himself from a murderous maniac that was stalking him."
This is a conspiracy theory the left requires because it's impossible to consider that there might be another explanation. Zimmerman was assaulted and he defended himself.
"This case is why countless thousands of people distanced themselves from the braindead, race baiting and race obsessed left. And you IDIOTS are still on about it."
"None of the rest of what you said is wrong, I just want to point out that he was 17."
"This case is why countless thousands of people distanced themselves from the braindead, race baiting and race obsessed left. And you IDIOTS are still on about it."
"Yea....if you are being followed and you are in danger that ""stand your ground"" law works for you as well. What a dumb fucking comment."
Yeah it was a fucked up situation. I just dont know where you got age 12 from

That’s fucking brutal
Both those comments are annoying as hell.
"The 'murderer' here comes off as a HUGE asshole boomer.  This response belongs on /r/wooosh.  

Funny that this dicknose randomly (I assume) says ""Hey Barbara"" because he's too stupid to know what the Streisand effect is.  

Everything about this is terrible."
"Imagine being upset enough by what some random boomer on FaceBook says that you write an essay. 

Christ I hope this is fake."

I think both responses are stupid.
Both comments are nothing but cringe. This generation shit is pathetic.
"Am I missing something very dramatic response ?? 

Is it that they should put SOS both generations know that...or they knew how to spell ...

"no such thign as bad or murderedbywords, say any nmw sk"
"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think just replying to old people with opinion like these are honestly pathetic and pointless and embarrassing. Everyone who sees these know that the old fuck is wrong and embarrassing him/herself. We don't need to add anything.  Just a waste of time."
No one hate's their kids as much as the me generation.
"You werent tossed on an island before you could read, forced to survive and spell sos and help for months? Pssh fucking Gen z."
He means kids can guess stupid ass passwords.
I'm with you I took it as just a dumb silly joke and this person is the asshole for responding the way they did
"~~Unfortunately, they used the word “wrong” instead of “incorrectly.” “Wrong” is not an adverb. The old man probably doesn’t even that, though~~

Edit: So I’m wrong. Wrong is an adverb. “What am I doing wrong?” is grammatically correct and “wrong” is describing “doing.”"

Nah it’s so mean!
"Do yourself a favour, Don't say this to any brainwashed religious bigots. They will just make your life miserable."
"It’s weird to me that people think this.  
There’s maybe an element of religion being such a large part of their lives that they can’t imagine that someone doesn’t have it.  
Or maybe it’s because, it’s a “you can’t say mine is wrong, because you have your own” type of argument. e.g. because you can say *“you say that me liking soccer is stupid, but you like hockey“* - but saying *“you say that me liking soccer is stupid, but you don’t have any interest in, or like, any sports”* just sounds awkward.
Weird either way.

4 fucking hundred??? I thought 20-30+
"Global press fails to understand how the US government is structured and asks the wrong person to end police violence against journalists. 

Journalists ask democrat mayors and governors to end the violence caused by their police forces. Just doesn't scream orange man bad does it? Is it any wonder Trump calls the media the enemy of the people when they blatantly mislead people like this."
"We should politely ask him to fuck off to Mars.

And then haggle down to curbing police brutality.

Since everything he does is so insane, maybe this batshit crazy idea is worth a try?"
And I thought HK's [277 cases](https://tl.hkrev.info/en/police-timeline/?_filterpost_english=attack-journalists-and-interfere-freedom-of-press-en) were bad enough.
"I don't understand how this puts money in Trump's pocket or how it helps him charge up his radical base.  

It is sad.  Trump won't do the right thing."
These “journalists” promote the very false narratives that produce this violence. It’s the bed they’ve made. Let them sleep in it.
The press thinks they are invisible or they invincible to the police because they are media is stupid. If you are in a crowd of protesters or looters the police shouldn’t care who you are. They are you use excessive force in general to remove people. The press do not listen to the police so the have to be acted upon accordingly.
"The **police should be violent towards rioters**, not journalists."
"Nah we're China now, we hate the media."
"We're not laughing. We're sad and worried that you might lose the last remnants of your democracy. We're concerned because we know the majority don't want this, but are being led by a minority of selfish idiots.

We're not laughing because we're not assholes.

Apart from Trump, we're actually smh-laughing at him, quite a lot."
"Seems like a lot of people who like freedom of speech really mean ""freedom for me to say whatever I want."""
">  Is it any wonder Trump calls the media the enemy of the people when they blatantly mislead people like this.

In an article about the press being shot at or arrested or beat up 400+ times

This guy is saying ""Is it any wonder Trump calls the media the enemy of the people"".  

You wouldn't see the point if it walked up and smacked you in the face."
what does that even mean?
"He is on record as being very fond of it.

[Please don't be too nice](https://youtu.be/NFgjNPiq9Cw).

The worst part is the crowd's reaction."
Fuck off.
We're also not laughing because we're on the same planet and America burning to the goddam ground would have a lot of unpleasant knock-on effects for everyone.
No. What they're saying is that Trump is not in charge of the police. The media is complaining to the wrong person.
"It means they've got to dig into this guy, stop with the sanitized reports about this pretend president and ""gut him"". On every broadcast, in every paper, on every blog every day. Start digging deep into these departments that turn a blind eye. All the coruption, all the dirty dealings all of it."
Or even just not pardoning criminal cops would be a start.
"You got that wrong, I think you are talking about all the US citizens going to Mexico for affordable health care in Tijuana."
"Oh shit, an apology! That'll fix everything! Guess we can all go home now because officer cockstain said he was sorry while beating nonviolence, nonresisting bystanders."

That game will end in a draw unless someone makes a stupid move
Weird. That's what we call a toe truck?
Clearly fake.
Tic-tac-toe is the worst game of all time. Kids are stupid
"It's called Tik Tok Toe, the premise of the game is basically this, you've got a cycle of nine days before the board resets, each day corresponds to a square, for each tik tok you make you get either an X or an O on that day's square, the winner gets the one of the losers toes."
"Yes - Tik tok toe is a terrible injury obtained from over exuberant tik tok performances. Bit like tennis elbow, but for toes"
You mean a [Luigi board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15nNY7uofNw)?

So sorry to hear your house burnt... But at least yoy salvaged your wedding ring! Is there any way I can support you from afar?
We need the lore to this story. Sorry about your house though :(
"If you start to feel weird while wearing it, you might need a trip to Mordor to take care of that thing.

That does not at all look like a scene from Lord of the Rings.

All joking aside, sorry about your luck. Way to find the positive in a bad situation."

Sorry but i think it's telling you something. XD
Gandalf got a little crazy while testing the ring
I feel like this should be Bad Luck Brian in r/AdviceAnimals

Sorry for about your house.
That's a weird way to search for the ring...
So sorry.

So you're going to rename everything named after the founding fathers? They were as evil as confederates.
"They don't listen to ""bad guy"" because they believe the union to the the ""bad guy"". So you have to use terminology that they can't argue with."
why would you mention the Karl-Marx-Statue here? that doesn't make any sense. he's not a war criminal or anything like that!?
"Why are some looking at statues as a a celebration?    Statues are used to memorialize bad events, too.  The idea is never to forget what happened and who did it."

The OP is a vapid argument."
I'm like really tired and still got some work to do.
That makes it even worse
This view point means you consider rebels in Nazi Germany to be bad people because they were also traitors.
"I have a 4 year degree in History from a Northern US university. 

Your over simplification is wrong."
Or just get rid of this silly tradition of enacting statues of people.
Nah it's just revisionism going on and self-hating whites trying to virtue signal. It's sad. They are ripping down statues that have nothing to do with slavery. Because it's animalistic nonsense.

"THAT
Try to remember how terrible it was for you to cry and how traumatic it was.
I am 23 and i remember that when i was at 4th grade my science teacher laughing at my speech and it made me cry. Thats a terrible expirience for children. At the end of a prank or a joke both sides should laugh, if its only 1 side and its you, you are an asshole"

"“... or I’ll give you something to cry about!”

 Terrible."

Fuck....
"As the youngest of five girls, yes, this needs to be said. Unfortunately, those who need this advice won't heed it anyway."
That’s sad.
"My mom always used to do this. I fucking hated it. One day I accidentally kicked her in the face while she was tickling me from my flailing around, and she stopped after that."
"Agreed. My dad used to tickle me a lot as a kid. I instinctively learned to avoid him and stay far away when he got home. I didn't mind tickles, but I hated it when he wouldn't stop."
"Had an uncle who would tickle HARD. I'd tell him to stop, that it hurt. He'd tell me ""no it doesn't."" HOW DO YOU KNOW, ASSHAT? And then he wondered why we hated him as kids- and adults, too! Turns out he's an all around dick."
"Seriously, doesn't this teach kids that if they cry they immediately control the situation and get what they want?"
"I always got that line, or ""why are you making that face? Go look in the mirror at the face you're making so you can see how ridiculous you look"""
"I also got that one:

>	“Mom please come back, Dad is scary”

>*my father takes the phone, gaslight my mother and hangs up.*

>”You think I’m scary? I’ll give something to be afraid of”

Edit: formatting"
I met a guy once that spanked his kids before they went anywhere because he “knew” they would be “bad” when they were gone.
Yeah I feel you. Sorry you had to go through that.
Youngest of five girls must be tough.
"Then there was the one where the mom does the same and the little girl just goes to wash off her hand, and mom is like, ""I'm sooo sorry to get poop on you, aren't you mad?"" And the girl just says ""Don't be sad mommy everyone has a accident.""

I think it has a lot to do with the reactions that have been modeled up to that point. Mom gets hysterical? So does the kid. Mom shakes off accidents with a ""no biggie""? So does kid."
"And it starts to hurt. You’re laughing and it hurts your chest and throat, the tickling hurts, your sides hurt, it’s just all around so unpleasant. I don’t know if that’s just me, but I find tickling genuinely painful. And then if you try and defend yourself, or you reflexively kick or elbow the person tickling you, suddenly you’re the bad guy. There’s always some justification about how they were just playing and you had to go and ruin the fun by being mean. No, just no. Don’t tickle people."
Mfers. Seriously this is why sometimes I think people should require a license to breed.
Jesus Christ it's too early for this. :(
So he is actually a mean asshole?
I cannot be held responsible for any injuries you receive while tickling me after I explicitly told you I hate being tickled.
That's something terrible to go through. How are you now?
People have still given me a shocked pikachu face for getting violent after I told them I would. They teach you not to touch people who don’t want to be touched in freaking kindergarten. How can people not grasp that?
"I'm with you. If they wanted me to fund their elderly care, they would've saved for my college education instead of blowing all their money on beer, cigarettes, and other stupid shit. Sorry parents, wish I could help, but I'm paying these student loans, can't."
"That's not what I fucking asked, now is it?"
"Given the likes of daddy o five, 8passangers and the Stauffer's I'm inclined to say bad parenting is unfortunately still quite prevalent these days too."
"“Sorry kids, we had to take Gam-gam to Soylent Farms.”"
Maybe the generation before that was worse?

2020 is not a good year
"Unfortunately I haven’t seen him in anything I can remember, nonetheless I hope his family can pull through this and RIP."
"I feel somewhat bad but I do not know who this is. 

Edit: It appears the downvotes have come from not watching enough Bollywood films."
Bollywood is going through a serious turmoill... Sushant will be missed
Terrible loss
Who the fuck is that
Fake news
"Yeah, they mentioned his manager in the article...between that and memories of his mom cropping up he must have been having a seriously shitty time"
Fuck Nepotism so much... All fucking useless kids stars and people like Sushant are being fucked by ppl like him
"He got 7th rank. I am shocked to know about his suicide. For one moment, i refused to accept the truth."
"Leaving this up is disrespectful, whether or not people think that you're ""deeply flawed"" is irrelevant. It just comes off as attention whoring"
You don't need to know who someone is to feel bad when they pass away.
What is wrong with you
My comment wasn’t racist.  You’re playing pretend or dangerously uneducated.
I mean... Muslims are also being ethnically cleansed in India but let’s not talk about that
That really is tragic
"Stupid question... What is a ""blind"" in this context?"
"Yes, unconfirmed rumors a bigwig Karan Johar was not happy with him ..."
">nepotism is rampant over there, and is one of the reasons why the MeToo movement failed in Bollywood

It did? Don't they understand that just means they're vulnerable to another campaign down the road?"
"Isn't as bad? Have you looked around? Don't trust the ""official"" numbers by the way, indian govt has held back a lot of data."
If it’s that bad then it’s actually fat worse than in the US.
It tells you all of the things he's been falsely accused of
I mean... what is the criteria for admission into graduate level colleges in USA? What are the admissions based on?
"The numbers aren't bad, bar a few cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Noida and Kolkata.

Banglore has basically seen the end of covid.    
You gotta give credit where its due."
"If you bothered looking up that guy's history but nope you're calling someone out for attention, that's laughable."
"I have. I consider the fact that he committed suicide, which he did himself, and shouldn’t be downplayed. 

When a tree kills someone, then we can talk about people somehow just randomly dying of suicide instead of committing suicide."
"I mean so is the US. According to the CDC, in 2017 there were ~49,000 pneumonia deaths. [(source)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/pneumonia.htm) In 2020, there are ALREADY over 100,000 pneumonia deaths. [(source)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1113051/number-reported-deaths-from-covid-pneumonia-and-flu-us/) I don't think that's a coincidence."
"While that article establishes doubts about the reported US cases, nowhere does it suggest that the problem is worse here than in India. It doesn’t address India at all."
"India wasn't officially polio-free until after 2011. The US has been polio-free since 1979. Maybe I don't understand what you're trying to say, but on the surface, that sounds like a blatant falsity."

But is anyone REALLY shocked that journalists entering these situations are getting caught up with rioters and crowd control tactics. No one has immunity out there
And the government wants to take our guns too.. This is gonna turn into that game called Division. Bad ass game btw.
"Hmmm. It's almost like the police are just armed Trump supporters, lashing out at one of their ""shared enemies"" the fake news.

People we ain't on a slippery slope no more. America is slidding down the hill."
Not gonna happen. Fox just got called out for photoshopping the same gunman into a bunch of pictures of Seattle and labeling pictures of Minneapolis as Seattle. They’re intentionally scaring idiots and inciting a culture war. They don’t want unity.
The fear mongering of the coronavirus and this fake racist narrative is organized.
"I mean they just need to watch Fox news, no need for a deeper conspiracy here imo"
">If that's not hot, what is? What horrifying shit have you seen?

fucking shield campers
"fuck legality. news stations should arm up (so police are too scared to raid, and yes that works), and instigate a revolt."
Do you have even one example of the idiot press saying “Go witch hunting and report people”?
Of fucking course indeed.
">no evidence of protesters being violent

We have tons of cops who say the protesters were violent and more often than not, that is sufficient ""evidence"" for the courts to give cops a pass."

Side effects can barely be worse than death
"Fuck the WHO. Suppressing the technology to broadly improve the human condition is immoral. 

Deliberately restricting the development of a means to cure diseases and fatal illnesses in babies is horrendously cruel."
"killing and then replacing all the blood stem cells is also how they cured HIV in a few patients. But in that case, because of the chemotherapy, the cure is worse than the disease, hence why we haven't cured everybody."
Horrific pain and terrifying mutations? Brain damage? Some things are worse. It's better to let someone die than give them something that cures them but also turns them into a cronenberg
That sounds painful
Seriously. Some of these illnesses are terminal. They weren’t going to be around to have/raise kids without treatment anyway.
Likely not as painful as a lifetime of sickle cell

"While i agree that wearing a mask will make working out difficult, dont go to a gym during a pandemic!"
These masks are duds but the Karen is still wrong.
I dont consider them to be muzzles but i do find them impossible to breathe in. Even the normal ones suffocate me but jesus... These people are fuckin stupid.
to think these people are crazy is another thing
"I don't trust under armour either, but that's because they're not great at what they do."
Wearing a mask during exercise is dangerous and stupid.
"She’s probably talking about me.... but on a serious note what does it matter to her what others are doing with THEIR face? I wear a mask to the gym for that specific reason, I know I’m going to be out of breath and on the verge of dying so I don’t want to be putting my nasty spit particles everywhere as I struggle to breathe"
"""She looked like she was going to pass out!""  
Well yeah, if she just did a Strenuous exercise on the Treadmill, she's gonna be tired from that. It's called Logic, Karen."
"I hate people who judge people who wear masks!!!! Some people wear it to protect others in their lives. 


I also hate when people who judge people who don’t wear the mask!!! Some people live in a 1 bedroom apartment with a cat!"
You mean the CO2 we breathe out?
I just don't understand how they keep missing the point. I don't wear a mask to stop from getting sick. I wear a mask in case I'm already sick so I don't spread it to others.
I mean I run 100 feet and I look like I’m gonna pass out.
It's how you identify idiots at the gym.
I've got some weird ass kinks.
"Ding ding. I had the covid, I have a cloth mask I wear. Not for myself, but just in case I can still spread it.

People are fucking dumb."
"I find them hard to breathe in, but it's an anxiety thing. I would probably have a panic attack if I tried to exercise in a mask!"
So you don’t get the people who you run by sick because you’re breathing heavily.
"It's insane. After having it, I can't imagine still wanting to wish it on anybody."
Even if it wasn’t why wouldn’t you want to take an extra measure that could prevent you or others around you from getting sick?

"This sub should be called idiot teen's hate and ignorance showcase.

These aren't even unpopular opinions, they are straight up morons holding on to some world view that isn't real."
"I'm so sick of hearing this. Have your opinion, but know that fat people deserve a place in the body positivity movement."
"Just wait until doctors start getting fired for ""shaming"" fat people when they state their diabetes and Liver failure is due to being literally 400lbs.

Because Science, data and evidence means fuck all now. 

All about those artificial constructs."
"I fully agree. My girlfriend used to suffer really bad with spots, and she can have really bad flare ups if  she deviates from her skin care routine or has a night out drinking. She’s gorgeous, funny and an idiot,  but it kills me how insecure she can become over something out of her control, and there’s no representation of it; unless it’s negative, and if anyone uses this movement to represent this: it’s hijacking. It makes me so angry."
Hit the nail on the head!! Reddit's hate for fat people is appalling.
"Thank you so much for putting in words what I can't. Even if someone is fat because of ""laziness"" or whatever insulting assumption is being thrown around, why should they have to hate themselves for it?! 

It's disturbing how much hate for fat people there is on Reddit"
A little late for that I'm afraid
Ok. It where the fuck is she pro-terrorism?
"It's hard to change your lifestyle when you know everyone just thinks you're a disgusting fat cow, depression is a terrible motivator for bettering your yourself."
"It isn't fat shaming to say someone is unhealthy. 

I say this as a fat man who used to be way fatter."
Fat men especially hate fat women because they think they deserve a skinny one.
It’s not a good look
"Hate for fat WOMEN

It’s a bunch of fat ugly men here saying these things I guarantee it. Start making them including a picture with their comment on this topic and we will see response rate go way down"
It used to be a defining trait of the user base before fat people hate was banned
"I’ve read some of their replies and their attitude is honestly disgusting. So much hate and cruelty towards fat people, especially fat women. 

If you want positivity, put it out into the world instead of bitter hate."
"Excalty and I mean the type of fat person who just keeps eating and does nothing about their health, I know some people can't help it."
I have a question for you - do you hate all people who are overweight or only obese people
"The last part is due to picture manipulation. Photoshop, instagram filters and stuff like that. Everyone has pores and people with none look stupid."
"I hate it when people do stuff like this. It basically encourages people to stay fat so that they can constantly feel validated, cause as soon as you lose weight you are no longer 'part of them'. So stupid"
"Wow, I've had bad acne scarring on my forehead since I was 12. I've never met another person having it as well!"

"If you look at it at diagonally, it looks like an angry chicken bandit"
I hate you so much. Now I cant unsee it

"I mean, it *is* minecraft"
What the fuck is wrong with you? Even as a joke.
"They have a data pack that allows them to name mobs ""silenced"" and they stop making noises. It isn't in the base game."
Yeah I’m just stupid.
Chicken.
