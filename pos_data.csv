"I once got suspended for cornrows. Somehow those a were a distraction, but the girl with purple and green hair who wore t-shirts with the back cut out like a hospital gown and so many metal bracelets on her arm that every time she walked it sounded like someone was throwing dishes into concrete was just ""expressing herself""."

I recently consulted at an investment banking firm where one of the MDs chews tobacco. Meaning he has cups of spit juice in his office that he spits into. Flecks of tobacco in his mouth and teeth. Mouth full of juice. That fucking smell. He's fucking disgusting.

Meanwhile I train. I keep myself lean-to-shredded 12 months out of the year. One of the ways I maintain that is meal prep - making and bringing my own meals etc. One day I come out of the kitchen area and his bitch ass wants to tell me that there've been complaints about my food smelling too ""ethnic.""

Fuck you all. Like forreal."
"How in the hell are those braids unprofessional? Even if BJ combed his birds nest, I still couldn't see how it would be more ""professional"" than her hairstyle?

Fuck. Reminds me when I was a page. New kid starts working on my shift one day. Boss lady immediately starts on him. ""Why are you late? (He wasn't) Why is your hair like that? You look like a rapper. Your hair better look normal tomorrow."" Little dude had the neatest short corn rows I'd ever seen and a fucking sweater vest and hell, even shined his shoes. He looked sharp.15 years old trying his best to impress for his first job. Day didn't really get better for him, either.

Next day she still didnt like his hair. But didnt say much. I don't know what she expected by ""normal"", but at least she didn't get on his case too much about his hair until he got it cut a few months later. 

I mean, I shouldn't have expected more of her. When she hired me, she asked her assistant if she had to hire a deaf guy. And her assistant, and the librarian in the desk over said that she can't not hire me because of my disability. Pretty sure the only reason I got that job cuz was she asked that question out loud and so didn't want to be seen discriminating."
"bojo does that kind of look intentionally to make people think he's some lovable buffoon instead of the racist, evil buffoon that he is."
Let's just call a spade a spade here. Professionalism is coded language for be more white. Your blackness is making the white workers uncomfortable.
I have 3B curls that I was finally getting a handle on and I was interviewing for waitressing jobs wearing it natural. I was getting no where. Before the last 2 interviews I decided to flat iron my hair and wouldn’t you know I got both offers.
"It's all for a sense of control against us. It's not that out hair isn't ""neat"" or ""suitable in a professional setting"". It's that it doesn't prescribe to their hairstyle standards.

What's outside their norm makes them uncomfortable."
I read somewhere he does that intentionally. Could’ve been bullshit idk
I guarantee if a white woman came in with braided hair nobody would say a god damn thing except “omg Brittany your hair is soooo cute!”
"Pretty much. When I graduated one of the professors had a *talk* to me about my hair. Saying to be seen as a professional engineer, you need to look professional. My hair was braided and for some reason its acceptable in a school setting, but not in a work environment.  I sold out and cut my hair, but since I got laid off from covid, im growing it back and going dread.  Not letting anyone tell me about my hair again."
no you don't get it. he's white.
"I think someone already said it but unprofessional is just a code word for white, definitely with the  way it's applied in the workplace"
"The more he can't answer a questuon, the messier his hair becomes."
Damn what a queen
"Most of our own will be quick to judge a nigga rocking the nappy look. Wypipo started it obviously, but I’ve seen many a niggas (older folks) judge cats for rocking plaits, twists, and dreads then be the first to ignore these Boris looking ass clowns.

Slick wypipo be like “is that your real hair”; “it looks messy” etc"
"Professional standards aren’t even professional, they’re white standards"
Well *I'm* ethnic so that logic tracks.

thanks fam"
That’s so insulting. But this is what we deal with regularly just trying to live. I refuse to conform my hair to professional aka western standards.
"You got like a workout and meal plan? 

I’ve been trying to find something simple and straightforward but 12 hours days for 12-14 days plus the pandemic is really fucking shit up. 

I bought a weight vest since the gym is closed and do a calisthenics routine 3 times a week. Remainder of days is a few miles run or bicycle. I eat like shit and don’t take time to plan that out. I assume that’s where my error lies."
"About a year ago, this guy in my school who always has twists came in with an afro. At lunch - on the same day - the headteacher told him he couldn’t come in like that  and had to get a haircut so he came in with a fade the next day. I honestly think it’s disgusting that they can just control what we can/can’t look like then call us uNpRoFeSsIoNaL"
Same reason he doesn't call himself Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson
"if you look up “professional hair styles for women) youll get straight/wavy hair(dos) and if you look up “unprofessional hair styles for women” youll get curly hair, braids and all of the pictures will be of black women. its so gross"
"i have chin length 3c/4a curls. every first interview, i make it a point put my hair in a low bun. if i get a second interview, it’s either in a ponytail or completely out. i’ve had over 15 second interviews since march, but i still don’t have a job."
I don't think he does anything intentionally.
"Ah yes, just like visa they’re accepted everywhere"
Yup.

"Stating the obvious, but your diet is a big part of it. You need to eat better, even in small ways. I'm not saying give up on all the good things (hell I train like crazy so I don't have to say no to dessert all the time lol), but the majority of tbt time you need to eat good.

- More veggies. Like a lot more. Good, varied ones.  
- Lean meats and good protein
- Less refined carbs and more grains that give your body fiber and other benefits.

I don't meal prep, I just stick to those things, mostly. What do you typ eat now?"

I will always upvote a post that makes fun of GTA V on PS5
They should use RDR2 instead. Then players can play with max graphics

It's you people that keep buying the milk...
Dear God... Please make it stop.
It's not nice to edit out the artist's signature! [Here](https://inkyrickshaw.com/comic/holy-cow/)'s the original for those who are interested!
Skyrim should be the second woman
It's the Dragon Ball of gaming.
I have Skyrim on my refrigerator.
Why make a new game when idiots keep giving you billions for the old one?
Please stop playing online. Just please. Online killed the single player DLC and now it’s killing all the other games they could be making.
I can milk you...
"Seriously, showing a 7 year old game as the first game they show for their new next generation console is just ridiculous, sad and embarrassing."
"We'll stop beating this dead horse, when it stops spitting out money."
Can we make a meme of reddit milking the re-release memes
Man if they gonna milk it they could at least make some singleplayer content ffs
oh boy! guess the judges has brought their sleeping bags!!
Intel and 14nm too
Not gonna stop till GTA becomes a malnourished child
I'm excited for the 2023 PC release of the PS5 release.
"Rockstar in 2090:""are you prepared for the mega ultra expanded enhanced version of gta V"""
Waiting for announcement of Skyrim for PS5...
I can Milk you
**MOOO?**
"I’m not going to buy the same game for the 3rd time, it better be at least discounted for users who hold the license to gtaV"
Damn you’d think they could do something new by now. Doesn’t make me want the console. Bummer.
Are there that many active users still making purchases?
Template?
Rockstar wouldn't keep doing this shit if it wasn't profitable.
"Everyone Talking about milking GTA5 and nobody thinks about
The Elder Scrols 5"
Its because of Online that we never got Single Player content ever again.
Are people really still buying things in this game?!
Will it actually run at 60 fps?  That’s the only “enhancement“ that might bring me back.  Otherwise no way.
"can't wait for the new re-release of skyrim on the next gen consoles, maybe the ps6 will see some new shit."
Tod Howard in the middle trying his darn best.
"Please modify this for ea's fifa as well, and put it in /r/fifa as well. they'd love it"
FIFA vs GTA. The fight of the century. Haha
"This is definitely the best one I’ve seen so far.
I actually did more than exhale out from my nose at it."
If they keep adding new online DLC’s I won’t be complaining
GTAV the new Skyrim.
Take my upvote!
Red Dead 2 was a great game as well!
Repost? Repost.
"I knew that it would be ported to ps4 but just the way they showed it, i was hyped for nothing."
GTA on ps5 : Once again i ask you for ur support .
It's not fair that they use the same cow surely right? Like each person should get their own.
This will defo be a meta joke when GTAVI does come out
"Are they going to just make the game prettier, or expand it, or anything useful?"
Blue Sky to Ice Age
Skyrim all dried up: first time?

Star Wars & Disney?
I can milk you
Just trying a gif as a profile pic
I was literally just looking at buying GTA for the PS4 and was amazed to see they are charging $30 for an 7 year old game
u/wastedtalent10
and it was PS4 footage as well. Truly some bizarre shit.
[One cow's nightmare is another cow's fantasy.](https://youtu.be/D2ztvgI72mE?t=12)
Let's be real for .5 and remember that gtav has literally nothing on Todd Howard and skyrim.
Awesome. A fresh start with a world of new opportunities to completely ignore single player.
I don't think rockstar are the ones doing it more than likely it's their publisher making them do it
I feel like everyone had forgotten about Skyrim.
"Wasn't GTAV the ""keystone"" game of the *last* console generation launch?"
"PS6 announcement day

*Here we present GTA 5 in 8k 60 fps*"
There is so much GTA V content that I'll probably never see
At least it’s free if you own it and you also get one mill every month until it’s released.
Ah i see you are man of culture aswell
"\>Blue Sky with Ice Age movies

\>Ubisoft with Assassin's Creed games"
Bethesda and rockstar would tie in this competition
Yo put up Bethesda with Skyrim too
I can milk you
I can milk you now
Good morning sunshine!
Let's see how much more karma people are gonna milk from this
They only pump the online udder though.
The best part is that all of you will buy it.
The new Skyrim
Does it count as a victory if half the milk's volume is blood? 'Cause at this point GTA5 doesn't have any more milk.
"Seriously, how many games are released on three different generations, without being nostalgic."
"I hope the next GTA lets you do shit like skateboard and BMX and surf and stuff.  Like just drive into a skatepark at 120km/hr and then steal a dudes board and then the controls swap from driving to ""flick it"" controls from skate

i'm just so desperate for a good skating game"
Laughed out loud OP you got me
"Buy a PC and you wont have ever worry about a remaster again. On a side note, R* should just have made a patch for the PS4 version."
The only good thing that's come put of this is if you log into gta online you get a million dollars.
Bethesda can be nearest rival with Skyrim for R* on this case
"Just stop buying GTA V guys holy shit, who cares"
Then stop buying it you suckers
They had to ban Bethesda out of the competition from killing a cow.
Watch GTA become the best selling game on PS5 as well lmao.
i can milk you.

All I want is a gta 4 remaster not another gta 5
Todd Howard and Skyrim enters the competition.
"if every person just stopped playing, they'd probably do something"
"I was a bit confused, were they showing off the ""enhanced"" version?  It looked exactly the same."
Finally a great competitora to try to beat Bethesda
GTA V is the second most expensive videogame in the history. Why bother making another one if the previous one is profitable
All I want is GTA IV on my iPad.  If it must be GTA V that’d be fine too.  We got GTA SA on iPad back in 2011.  What is the deal with never porting any new mainline GTA to iPad?
Fifa bring out a new game every single year that barely changes. At least GTA are keeping it honest with the same old game and not just adding numbers to the title..
Is GTAV the new Skyrim?
"Milk that cow the best way we know how,
 parkhill project kick pow"
This comic strip reminds me of magical Trevor.
I'm just waiting for gta sa remastered.
"not, bigx doesn mtatter"
More like a dead horse beating contest.
Blizzard would like to attend
"Skyrim, Final Fantasies, Resident Evils : our battle will be legendary"
"Thing is if they made a new one I'd buy it. But Rockstar has only gotten $120 from me in the last eight years because all they've released was GTA5 and RDR2.

I'll gladly buy a game, but not an in-game currency."
Rockstar Leaves *No Stone Unturned*
Rockstar is so overrated it blows my mind.
I don't get it.
Plot twist : GTA 6 will be first available on KFC bucket gaming console.....
"These ""R* are milking gtav memes"" are milking the event more than R* is"
Coooowwwwww
"Honestly, it feels weird that a game released my sophomore year of high school (I’m now 22!) is going to be released on yet another generation of consoles. 

I understand that it all comes down to money. I also understand that the re-release of GTA V on PS4 and Xbox One were a given since it was released a year before those consoles came out. However, it still seems absolutely ridiculous that it’s getting yet another re-re-release. And I’ve seen almost zero hype for this. I think for every person who’s actually excited about GTA Vs re-re-release, there are at least 10 people that aren’t."
Tbf I do still play gta5 single player quite often
"Ah shit, here we go again"
Ksi's reaction was the best.
“megalodon shark cards on sale!  only $500 US for 1 million in game dollars and you get this car”.        why did i pay for this game?
The cow is too old. The  milk that cow is giving is becoming more and more toxic. Adding new DLC's is not gonna make her a new cow it's just like making it more and more toxic and soon dead.
"I'm happy to have it again, ita great game"
So are we even going to get a GTA VI? I heard it was in early development so will it be ready for the PS6?
Myself and others who played GTA V on PC for years now basically have been playing it in next gen graphics for years now. Buying it again when I get one of the new consoles? That’s a no for me dawg.
"They're getting a lot of backlash, so it wouldn't surprise me if in the next couple days the release screenshots/gameplay of the enhanced version. Or who knows, maybe a gta 6 teaser?"
Needs more Skyrim
"I'm waiting for the announcement of Skyrim remastered 2nd addition..
Skyrim is the only game that can beat R* GTAV."
Y’all don’t understand how pissed I wasssss
I've had enough of gta 5 it's time to make gta6 rockstare ffs. How can you pretend people play the same game for 8 years? Jesus dude
the new trailer got more dislikes than the original one has gotten
"We went from consoles you can natively record gameplay on VHS to consoles with Ray-Tracing, wow"
"Last years champion, Bethesda, is still going!"
"Another day, another ""rockstar milks gtav"" post"
"whoo hoo, a game fundamentally limited by the 2006 hardware it was originally released on."
I would like like to see that with skyrim ... I think iit beat gtaV in term of milking XD
I wish they'd milk RDO. Because then that would hopefully mean new content every few months.
\*Holocaust milking contest.
Am I the only one who likes this? Tried it on PS3 but it kept crashing.
"I'd say I'm suprised...and I kinda actually had to shout out loud ""WTF"" right now, but whatever. Rockstar makes enough money with re-selling this game over and over again and with the online mode.  
  
Question is just if, when people are finally done with GTA V, anyone still works at Rockstar who can develop an actually good game."
The lifespan of a cow is 18-22 years
It’s hard for me to say GTA is milking with as much content they still give.
Are they going to actually improve upon the game though dynamic A.I new weather patterns and conditions and yes graphics without that weird thing that the graphics do
"Just don't buy it. It's not like they're doing this _instead of_ GTA 6, it's just for the meantime. You know RDR2 released less than 2 years ago, right? It's not like it's been ages since Rockstar released a game."
"They skipped a whole generation of consoles with no new GTA. 

PS2- 3, VC and SA. 
PS3 - IV and V
PS4 - V
PS5 - V
PS6 - V"
At least one of the other competitors should be Bethesda.
"As long as people keep buying the GTA re-re-re-re-releases, they're going to keep milking it."
[Milk that same cow](https://youtu.be/JiSS5xn_0fc)
*Laughs in Nintendo*
"I'm actually tired of Rockstar and their game mechanics. Shitty ridgid controls, goofy camera, the absolute shitty hand holding it does when it comes to missions and how you complete them. It's a game popular with adults but made for kids."
"Good, another one of thess shitty memes. Havent seen this sentiment 1000 times in the last 24 hours"
"Nothing new really. I feel let down with the new gen line ups and hardware. Like Demon Souls?Really?  I beat that game like 12 times.  I'm not buying into this new gen fake hype.  I'm skipping this one right now.  

Playing it safe and making  business moves still seems weird in the gaming industry.  The first of something in gaming is always life changing isn't it?  Then the part twos and threes come out trying to grasp at that feeling again.  Similar to the way additive drugs affect the users.  AAA studios are suffering from money fever and lost creation like Hollywood.  

No despair here because I can sit and wait for that one gaming miracle that happens every 10 years or so lol."
No Skyrim??
"People keep buying it, playing it and spending money on it. The player base is huge and people expect them to stop?"
"They gonna ray trace it, increase texture so that it eats 89% of your 800GB storage. Add 15 hour DLC and sell it for full price. 

Here we go again.  Again."
"From PS3 to PS5, let’s see if they’ll sticks to it until PS7 is announced"
Welcome to the world of modern triple aaaaaaaaaa gaming.
"Crazy idea, but maybe if we stopped buying the new versions when they release them, they wouldn't do it anymore."

"What a great way to reveal a new generation of games, by showing one released in 2011."

"""wHy DiD i MoVe HeRe? I gUeSs It WaS tHe WeAtHeR."""
Here we go again.
[Aww my god no!](https://youtu.be/o-cA6DZ1ykk)
I can't wait to hear about the remaster of the remaster of Skyrim on PS5.
Well they had to show at least one that excited a bunch of old impotent shareholders
Especially since it was PS4 footage with zero promises of what was going to be new or improved. Sigh :(
The must be waiting for the PC 2 to come out before releasing GTA VI
"Hijacking the top comment to say all the people who go out and buy these re-releases are just as much at fault because the companies wouldn't be doing this if they didn't know people were gonna buy them. 

And who the hell IS buying them? I have to wonder. It's not like your casual gamer wants to own 6 copies of skyrim. I wonder how many people in this thread complain about this shit and then go fork their money over."
"I was waiting for a side by side of even just updated graphics but the same story. I would have been fine with that. Instead, we were just trolled."
do they have to buy it again? that'd be so funny. especially knowing that we got it for free on epic a few weeks ago.
at moment rockstar is at heavy competition with bethesda on who releases dead cow-5 more often
RE 4 enters the competition
is there slated a skyrim for ps5?
"Honestly, that's the game that truely is milking. 9 years old, several ports. At least GTA adds new content often/consistently. 

Still love Skyrim though."
or the witcher 3
"Fus Roh Dollar!

Bah gahd, that's Todd Howard's music!"
Something's Amish here.

"Atleast you can use those leather strips to make armor. 

Gta5's cow is only good for making fuel for a crack fire."
Well thats an image I didn't need.
You mean Bethesda's cow... In the context of this meme Skyrim *is* the cow
PS5?
"The very first game they showed for their ""future of gaming"" PS5 show is a game that was on PS3.  It was also the game that got the most time at the show."
I’m hoping that they have LA Noire 2 in development and give it the RDR2 treatment.
"True, top end PCs struggle at 4K with that game. If they can show it running 60fps at 4K on PS5 they will make a big statement."
I can imagine it serves a marketing purpose. Like they will drop the GTA VI announcement on the day GTA V enhanced gets released on PS5
Red dead online flopped so they won’t. They don’t give a shit about the single player in terms of profit.
RemindMe! 7 years
"The original GTA games were released on PS2, PS3 and PS4. Plus all the mobile platforms and Mac OS.

I'm certain this game will be released for PS6 as well."
"I have a theory on GTA5 for PS5. I think the plan is to remake GTA5 in a way that will make it compatible with the eventual GTA6. They talked about it being ""expanded and enhanced"" and have also talked about having GTA online as a stand alone thing. My theory is that new additions will see the story link into GTA6 and once GTA6 comes out it's online will just be another part of GTA online. 

Rockstar don't want to unnecessarily kill the golden goose that is GTA Online. Much better to bring GTA5 along as a map in a more expansive GTA online. Sell a bunch more copies off the better graphics and whatever new elements lead into GTA6 then releases GTA6 and reinvigorate the cash cow."
I think they'll remaster the PS3 first
My theory is that this might actually be the last console generation because games won’t fit on discs anymore in 7 years. When they stop even offering disc playing consoles they will switch to a thin client streaming platform which will not really be a console anymore.
RemindMe! 7 years

"Wait, really? That's awesome, I'll definitely play through it again in that case"
"Seriously? 

A game that sold at full retail price for several years, already made  the platform generation jump once, and still make rockstar money hand over fist? 

Yeah they charging for it. 

All things considered, the game was worth every penny, even outside the online content the world and story are very replay able."
"Lol no, only the online. The single player you have to buy again."
"GTA Online will be free.

GTAV most likely not."
"Re4 is on:android,ps4,ps3,ps2,gamecube,wii,xbox 360,xbox one,and two versions to pc

Gta v:ps3,xbox 360,ps4, Xbox one,pc

Skyrim: pc-(3 times?),ps4,vr,ps3,xbox one,xbox 360,switch

But skyrim had really great innovations and resident evil hasn't stopped at the fourth tittle"
"They kept making new RE games. TES and GTA, not so much."
Rayman 2
RE4 doesn't really count considering they just announced RE8... They've released a couple games and a couple remakes in the time it's taken them to release skyrim and GTA on 3 generations of consoles.
Exactly lol
Hush now. Quit trying to make mindless consumers more self aware.
I'm scared lmao
"Thanks, it's very good meme source material."
"You mean Bethesda, right? Since they're the ones doing the milking? 

I'd have to say that EA does more milking of franchises, but then I suppose the FIFA fans are used to it by now..."
"WHY AM I NOT GETTING NUTRIENTS, I NEED FOOOOOD!"
GTAv came out on the PS3 and the PS5 hasn't been released yet...
lol I refuse to buy it for ps5 unless it's like $5 or something.
Now with ray tracing!
At least Skyrim got a remastered version a few years back. They're not going to release the OG 2011 version. GTA5 has literally been the same since 2013 except for a sometimes clunky first person mode.
2013
Your thinking of Skyrim. 11/11/11. First day I built a gaming PC and the first game I ran on it.
9-17-2013 Still remember it like it was yesterday
2013
2013?
"yup 

https://youtu.be/P20ASB1MdnI"
"Not only did it show up, they opened the event by announcing the PS5 is essentially getting the PC port of the game."
Gta 5 vr is still a possibility
"I was expecting Skyrim to be in one of the panels. 

My disappointment has never been so high."
At least GTA5 online is a huge thing and explains why they aren't in a rush to move on. Skyrim is just a dead horse
"It's think it's spelled ""DeadCau5"
I just remembered they're both the 5th installment of their respective series... wow.
"To be honest, I think gta is worse. Bethesda has at least *done* new things between skyrim and now. Rockstar is just milking microtransactions."
It's True that re4 has gone to EVERYTHING but they made dozens of other games as a plus
Not the same
"*Skyrim on Xbox One, PS4, 360, PS3, and Switch*


That's why I'm not buying an X Series until the Elder Scrolls 6 comes out."
I've played it on 4 systems and completed the main story on 0 if them. I get lost in side quests and exploration and eventually stop playing.
Rockstar taking the fun out of fundamental.
Calm down Sean Connery.
It'll be a 6 on the 'Quaker scale when they do.

Yep yep! Skyrims cow is basicly bethesda strips now wink wink... because its bethesdas cash cow... or Skyrim the Cow.
"Yep they are launching an enhanced version of GTA V on PS5, it was shown at the PS5 reveal couple of days ago."
"I never played the first one, though it did look really interested."
"Digital Foundry wasn't too impressed with the performance of games they showed - a lot of them turned out to be 30fps, and yes that's accounting for the video quality.  They also puzzled out that some will be PS4 releases too because their resolution dropped to 1080p in the trailers.  Other titles had varying resolutions below 4K.

So much of the ""future of gaming"" presentation came off as not quite there yet."
"Yeah, I just built a new PC with an i5 9600k and a 1080ti I found a good deal on. Still better to run it in 1440p. At least I get 50-60fps that way rather than the 20-30 4k wants to run at."
"While that may be true, I think it's more that they can still sell RDR2 full price on PS5 and people will buy it."
They just need to have some goddamn faith!
Let me know bro.
RemindMe! 7 years
I'm here in this historical moment.
Ps1 and gameboy color and windows as well
"They’ll probably remove some of the GTA V songs eventually, like they did to the previous games."
"Rockstar would be making a huge mistake carrying anything over from GTA V's online. GTAO is so oversaturated with ridiculous and overpriced and overpowered shit, any new players coming into GTA VI would be hopelessly behind. No one's going to spend much time playing a game where a basic pistol is all they have to defend against flying rocket launcher motorcycles and mission payouts have no hope of getting them caught up."
"This a solid theory, in rdr2 they have almost the entire rdr1 map included. Shit would be like half a terabyte of game lmao"
"Yeah us GTA fan boys that grew with it have always dreamt about going to the airport and getting off in vice city, San Andreas or liberty city. Essentially the airport is where you'd switch the games. GTA 5 is part of that so if they fix the graphs for the next generation and add the other towns they can resell those games to every new generation of video games and build on the cities you can travel to. I just hope on this new gen they at least release a version of vice city and get this mechanic going. After vice city and liberty city they can add whatever new city they want"
The online portion will be free to PS5 exclusively. They’re releasing an enhanced edition in 2021
"It's only free so they'll suck people in until they buy shark cards. That game is grindy as fuck, you can't realistically buy anything fun with just in game cash."
"Doom makes sense, it's eternal."
Don't forget about Skyrim for Amazon Echo
Re4 is also on Switch
Hold me
"Yeah I meant Bethesda. 

EA could be the third one"
"True. Anyone who makes yearly sports games is way worse, We don’t put it in the same class because it’s technically different games each year. even though basically nothing is changed and they could just keep the same game for like 5 years at a time and just update the rosters..."
We need them to protest so the rest of us can get a new game lol
There was an event that showed GTA V was coming to the ps5.
"Hmm maybe they're confusing the ""release"" with when it was announced in 2011"
The first trailer was shown 2011
"Give it a few days, he'll be right"
"That was the release date of [one of the worst movies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810913/) ever. But one of the most creative launch dates used by a film, it is a movie about twins - 11/11/11."
Yep a few days before school still remember dad letting me miss the first day to keep going.
"I was in high school when IV came out, don't insult me here with the old man talk"
"I was a old man when that game came out, now I am a ghost."
don’t you interrobang me plz
why though???
"And yet even if the cost of a decent PC and PS5 are the same, exclusives will draw people to their platform.

I really hope microsoft does well this next generation. Play Anywhere games, games pass, no more console exclusives (all will come to PC). I like the angle they're taking and think it will pay off if they make their software and interfaces better."
"maybe they'll do it when they finally stop playing whack a mole with VR mods (and absolutely failing to get them shut down).  
Rockstars weird hatred for modders is just insane."
"And when that one slows down in sales, they'll open the emergency glass case with a red ""Switch port"" button."
Don't do that. Don't give me hope.
All the kids playing it going to the strip club in VR...
GTA V VR or GTAVVR?
Uh oh I would definitely buy that if it was compatible with the AIM controller.
Yeah. Coming to you with the brand new Playstation. Playstation 6.
"We don't have to live in the past anymore, aren't we so lucky?"
"That’s not really accurate though. The elder scrolls has had lots of content since Skyrim. ESO has the summerset isles, elsweyr, blackmarsh, the wood elf domain, and lots more too."
You underestimate how many people still play Skyrim then
"Yeah, I feel like it's not a fair comparison at all. In the years since RE4 was released and subsequently rereleased a billion times on a million platforms, Capcom has published/developed a shitton of other games.

R* has made exactly one other completely new game since then, and a ton of rereleases (like shit, if you think they're milking GTAV bad, go look at how many platforms you can play LA Noire on). And sure, Capcom is a bigger company, but it's not *that* much bigger.

That moment when you're softly defending a money hungry, greedy company from being compared to another, even more hungry and greedy company."
"Also RE4 story holds up, it's not just sandbox gameplay"
"Well, alternatively you could buy it and just not buy the inveitable Skyrim port."
Don't forget the PSVR and Alexa versions!
I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't be excited to see GTA5 come to Switch. They could probably port the last gen version if they wanted.
"The shiny Letterkenny reference in the rough, made my day good sir!"
And skate.
"Maybe there’s an increase in active users? 

/s unless it’s private and is actually used frequently."
Enhanced my ass. Same 3rd generation graphics. The only enhancement will be to Rockstar’s bank account.
Kind of funny I only played GTA 5 on my 360 and kind of thought what y'all are thinking back when it was announced on PS4 xbone. Now since it's been a few years since I played and I want a ps5 I may get it haha
"“Enhanced” 

Yeah I doubt they’re gonna enhanced anything unless they use a new game engine or something to improve those graphics. The only good way they could enhance it would be to add more solo playing content."
It was lots of fun.
It was fun and unique.
"Tbf, [4k gaming is stupid](https://youtu.be/ehvz3iN8pp4)"
"Honestly I’d buy RDR2 again if they added some new stuff. I sunk 400+hours into a single play through if that game and I was always discovering new stuff. Hell I’d probably be playing it again right now but I’m forcing myself to play other games. I’d kill for some story mode DLC, but unfortunately we all know that’ll never happen."
They just need SOME MONEY!
RemindMe! 7 years
"Good point. The counter point is that the people who do buy all that shit won't want to start all over again. Also be ever introducing this stuff Rockstar have shown they don't really care.

There are rumours GTA6 will be set in the 80's so it's possible they do keep the cars guns etc. from GTA5 separate from GTA6 but you can get all the shit from GTA6 in GTA5. So you can buy 80's shit in GTA5 bit can't buy shit from 35 years later in the 80's.

I really think the're not just going to abandon GTA5 Online given how profitable it still is, they'll try to find a way to fold it into the new games online mode."
I think that's why they're spinning GTA Online off into a stand alone so it's a much smaller file. Then when GTA 6 comes it'll come with GTA Online free. Wouldn't be surprised to see GTA Online free for anyone but you gotta pay for GTA 6 and the new content that comes with it.
"Sad part is it'll sell well with minimal effort on Rockstars part since people are waiting on a new GTA even if its the same fucking game. I wonder if they'll include some extra missions in the story line at least, but I have my doubts."
"Because their online portion is their money farm. They made it free so there's more playing it. 

An overinflated market of cars and buildings that are there to tempt you to buy shark cards as shortcuts. Even the most expensive shark card won't get you much.. maybe a couple dumb looking super cars."
"Only for the first 3 months, so any non 1st 3 month buyers will be SOL"
I bought everything I wanted by farming the various businesses and waiting for things to go on sale. Never bought a shark card. I don't think I even hit level 100 so it's not like I grinded for years to buy stuff.
 [https://i.imgur.com/wEfpY7U.gif](https://i.imgur.com/wEfpY7U.gif)
RDR2? Just wait. It will come eventually.
"What a great way to reveal a new generation of games, by showing one released on two generations of consoles before. That works better."
"Yeah probably thinking of the word ""revealed"""
First trailer was released in 2011.
I ever tell you about Trevor?
lol good point. Reminded me of the PSVR release - do we have any info on a next gen PSVR?
Ive heard the name but never seen it. I love most of the films Adam Sandler is in though so ill prolly end up watching it some day.
I played that so much in sophomore through junior year of high school that when I went outside I complimented the real world's sick graphics.
Money. Man I used to love Rockstar.
"Because Rockstar knows they can scalp even more cash off of microtransactions without making new content. 

Its about getting your money. And nothing else.

Unfortunately for Rockstar, they don't seem to have noticed what happens to AAA studios when they only care about maximizing profits for too long.

Consumers will just spit on their name more and more until everyone hates them."
"We don't want improved graphics or options through mods if we can sell those as well.

Bethesda made that mistake. Then tried to reverse it with paid mods. That bite them in the ass. But you can be sure mods will be more difficult/paid for with tes6"
"Eh... Not really, when you are milking a property for all its worth, Rockstar wants all the monies. Modders might take away some of their DLC cash."
"Every single item they've added since release (for $5.99 real-world-dollars each) could have been added in by a dedicated enough modder or team of modders *for freeeeeee*. You gotta use every part of the animal when you're working with a cash cow like this, my guy."
"Please no.  Please.

Id rather get a VCS or SA remake on the Switch.  Ive played 5 as many ways as I can think of by this point."
360/PS3 version should be no problem to port.
"As a Switch owner, no thanks. 

I don't need ports that are downgraded."
Oh man it would actually be amazing with the AIM controller...
...and none of that would exist if they had microtransactions and online play in Skyrim.
"> rereleased a billion times on a million platforms

For those keeping score at home, that's 1e+15.  Or a quadrillion.  Some would call this a conservative estimate."
Let's not act like gtav doesn't have a fucking awesome story mode
I think we know that's just not true. See above.
"PS3, oh shit look a new GTA!!

PS4, buy a PS4 to play GTA 5, and you can run over people and pets! Oh and it looks a little better too.

PS5 ??? 

...

You can't fucking keep the same game going for 3 fucking generations! We gave the last one a pass because it came out at the end of the system's life. You should have GTA 6 finished by now! And it should be based out of London, because you haven't visited London sense the birds eye view games!"
"""yeah but look at the grass and the leafs!"""
"I might get downvoted for being a pedant, but console generations don't work by constantly having the newest consoles be the first gen. It's next gen or current gen depending on how recent the newest consoles are, but that's about it. The 3rd generation of videogame consoles was the NES, the PS3 was 7th gen."
3rd generation? I thought GTA V first came out on the 7th generation?
wait until they re-release the enhanced version on PC
At least they’re giving the game for free to anyone who owns it on ps4. It’s literally a free enhanced version on your new system so I don’t see the reason people are complaining
Third generation? PS3 is like seventh and we're entering the ninth.
If you have a full crew running heists and missions is a ton of fun. Also they have a bunch of whacky racing and other game modes. It’s a good time if you have a few people with you. Hope this helps!
we enjoy things you don’t basically
It’s almost like there’s a world of people with interests and hobbies that don’t overlap with yours
"We get it, you don't have friends."
"I actually never even played the campaign, didn’t have any interest. Got far enough into it to load into Online and never looked back. 

I bought the game specifically to play GTA Online with my friends, and man we had a super fun couple of years with it. Doing all the missions, heists, races, just screwing around in the overworld and finding ways to have fun. It was awesome."
"That depends on the person. I love online, I've been having a blast for weeks."
"Huge number of quality of life improvements (garages and the mechanic are my main ones), new cars and vehicles and regular new content, closest thing to a GTA RPG made so far.

All wrapped up in a lovely grindfest, that abuses the sunk cost mentality to keep you interested, playing regularly, and paying regularly.

If you've got plenty of friends who still play GTA Online, it can be pretty fun. But if you've not it's really a poor experience.

Recently fell out of it myself. Even with free money from the weekly stuff and Twitch rewards, I still never felt even close to most of the people. And they deliberately cultivated an environment where other players can and will just kill you on site. Also fuck the Oppressor MK2. I discovered modded SP and have no intention of going back to MP."
"bethesda and rockstar are learning an important lesson-- that if the hype for your sequel is almost unbearable, you can release the same game and your fans will shovel money at you for just a taste of something slightly new."
"Yeah, a game that could run on hardware from 14 years ago. That works even better"
"Last time I played GTA5 was on Xbox 360 when Xbox 360 was still relevant and had an active playerbase. Blows my mind it’s STILL being re-released. 

This is the path that Skyrim paved"
"I'll be honest, I'm replying it for a second time. Firs time was on 360, this time on xbox one. It's still an amazing game. Never really got into the online portion."
"Then you show the high end graphics one next it and they look better. It's like the the girls who bring friends they think are less attractive with them to seem more attractive.

GTA V what the fuck is this shit? Other games... Now THAT'S what I'm talking about!"
By that logic Star Citizen is older than most reddit users.
Lmao somebody in the comments said “When you realize the game is just cyberpunk and the release date is 2077.”
That trailer already looked amazing back then. Can it come out now? Pretty please.
Nothing but pointless patents and an official comment about psvr being supported on ps5.
We don't.
And that's how EA went out of business....oh wait...
"They'll get half consumers, but triple their profits. Rockstar is crying their way to the bank because of all the gamers who won't buy their games."
">Consumers will just spit on their name more and more until everyone hates them.

At the end of the day, those AAA studios that chose the money route are still AAA studios; they could not care less about our opinions and are perfectly happy printing money."
"EA Sports, it’s in the spit."
"I don't play any of the online bullshit so I'm not their target audience in that regard but GTA5 and RDR2 Single Player were top notch. Well worth the $60 price and I would have easily coughed up for money for DLC but it is what it is. 


I feel that when their Single Player Campaign experience goes to shit, then we will see them start to align with the more greedy companies like EA/Bethesda.  I don't think that's going to happen. I think Rockstar recognizes that an excellent, award-winning SP experience is a necessary foundation for what would be years or decades of lucrative MTX.

I hate MTX and have no desire to play their games online so it's always a benefit for me."
*cough* Blizzard *cough*
Acting like GTA 6 won't be one of the best selling games of all time
"Which is bizarre because Bethesda's other rallying cry is/was ""fuck it, the modders will fix it""."
"They don’t trust they can make better moda for their own games and release them as paid mods?

Insecure bunch"
"Im not worried about that.  
There is no such thing as a dev studio capable of stopping modders.

Aside from that bethesda atcually invests heavily in modders, shaping them into fullblown devs.  
The creation club content bethesda actually pays industry rates for to modders. As a modder you pitch some content to bethesda. If they agree they will set milestones for you and you get paid each milestone.   
Very valuable industry experience that looks good on your resume and actually pays a good price for the work. it's a proper contract job and not some lame intern thing.       

Blocking modders is not bethesda's thing. Instead they'll give us tonnes of financial incentive to only release mods via beth.net"
"Yes, they didn't release a single thing that would require a team. All of them are things a solo dev could do in their off hours in about a week."
What I woudl love is another GTA Chinatown Wars game. It was a lot of fun and I think the old overhead style would really work on the Switch in portable mode.
I'm one of the rare gamers who's still not played gta v or any gta for that matter. I just got gta v for free so maybe I'll finally give it a shot.
"Certainly, although as I've discussed in a different reply, I would strongly hope for the cockpit view inclusion from the later versions. I can't picture it being an overly taxing detail on Switch either."
I never liked cars and race and that must be at least 70% of the game and remember that it is a sandbox open world game
"It's hand holding and monotonous, yes there are good missions but fuck me so many of them are boring; motherfucking yoga as a prime example. If i could play the missions with a couple of friends now that would change everything."
Afraid you'll run out for milk some evening and come with with the latest Skyrim port?
"PS2 has GTA3, Vice City and San Andreas.

GTA5 has PS3, PS4 and PS5."
"A GTA in London would be amazing, Buckingham Palace could be like the military base"
"It took them 5 years after gta 4 to come out with gta 5. It took another 5 years after that to come out with rdr2. Gta 5 started development in 2008 and rdr 2 started development in 2010. It takes a long ass time to make that shit, and I bet gta 6 will take even longer if they make it a major step up from 5. So I'm sure they're working on it and it won't be for another couple years or so before we hear anything. 

That being said, they could have just said ""hey gta 6 is gonna be a while, here's gta 5 enhanced while you wait."" Or just done nothing at all. But $$$"
"It's not really up to you (or me). GTA online is super popular and supporting the new consoles makes sense. It's not like it takes all of their staff to port it over. I don't think the ps5 version will be as popular as the PS4 version, but it'll still sell millions of copies"
Why would they make a new one when the old one is still selling like crazy
"That's the thing.  I haven't played GTA V since release, but last I checked, it's still one of the most frequently purchased games there are thanks to the online.  It only makes sense for them to port it to next gen consoles.

The part that I find hilarious though, is that Sony fucking opened with this game.  If it was just like a tiny part of the show, I doubt most people would care.  But since they made it seem like it was a big deal it became a meme."
"No I'm blaming Rockstar.Just because the predatory microtransactions, which like many others are designed literally using psychological manipulation methods, are still making money, it doesn't make it the players fault.

They wouldn't have put those in if they didn't know it would make money. They wouldn't have literally put gambling in the game if wasn't going to make them money. They choose to keep GTA V as a cash cow, because 2K and Rockstar have that kind of attitude to game development, same as most large gaming companies.

&#x200B;

Don't hate the players, hate the game. And the game is rigged to manipulate players into spending cash."
"True. I purchased it for story missions and have put zero extra money while doing all online missions.

OTOH i dont exactly blame R* for anything. Its nice to keep V live and recent while there is no 6 to play. Unless it delays 6 and undermines its quality ofc."
"Nah, blame rockstar.

They’ve made a game where content in it costs just as much as the game itself. 

And it’s not naturally fun to get to that content. It’s a grind. 

No body is having fun grinding, and when you’re a grown ass adult with not as much time, but want to do cool shit/ use new shit, sometimes paying is the only way. 

Fuck rockstar. Make the game and new content actually accessible"
Apologies I was referring to the third PlayStation
Apologies I was referring to the third PlayStation.
Third PlayStation is what I was referring to
Racing is a joke in GTA though. Cars in lower positions get a speed boost so if you're in first you will ALWAYS be caught no matter how well you drive.
Damn that works the best I think lmao.
Still no switch version tho
Lets not pretend development is quick in star citizen . Some how some people pretend like it's pretty cool they are still in early alpha
"No, but you could argue that EA could actually make more money by not being the way they are. At least in the long-term. ME:A, Anthem, SW BF 2, the BF games. Pretty much all recent AAA releases from EA were ""below projections"" afaik. MTX are a great way to make money now, but sooner or later that cash flow might dry up more and more. Obviously depends on how stupid the population becomes, so I guess EA are going to be just fine when I look at the state of the world."
"What new games are coming out of Maxis? Or visceral games? 
 
I'd put my money on Bioware next."
"That's one of the main reasons I'm going to wait like 3 years before playing ES6. That thing is going to be a broken wreck of a game when it first comes out, as is Bethesda tradition."
"The fact that you had an easier time with Vortex, a fairly garbage mod manager, speaks volumes of how shitty Bethesda's implementation actually is"
"I could never really get into the top-down GTAs.  Given the popularity of Hotline Miami and Enter the Gungeon, a top-down GTA on the Switch might do really well.  Assuming its a new game."
It’s not for everyone but I would at least recommend installing it and just taking a casual ride around the city. It’s incredible how detailed it is.
"Adding on. Myself included. Havent played it. Waited for it on PS3. Knew there was a possibility of a PS4 port. Procrastinated after each price drop/sale.  Still not getting it. Such a shame? GTA 4 was a great game. Completed it twice, prior to the DLCs. 

Im waiting on Midnight Club."
I tried to play VCS a few years ago on PSVita but the gfx were rooooough.  An update would be great because the story was interesting and the criminal enterprise building system was fun as hell (at least how I remember it).  Having 5 portable would be cool but at this point I cant support R* re-releasing GTA5 anymore.
GTA V mobile. I'm calling it!
Such a profound statement
I'm excited to the next watchdogs because of London too. GTA back in London would be top.
"There is much to currently mock about o country, literally all sides and spectrums of society could be mocked"
"This. I kinda resent revisiting same setting. Without playing 4., V felt like SA remake. Either build a consistent ""universe"" by adding more recent jokes and references or expand the story in uncovered setting - auto theft in eastern europe, middle east supercar craze, russian diy modding madness.

Part of fun playing GTA is exploring places i cant afford to go to :D.

What i've heard of 6 it might be 5 with vice city (so a revisit) and isilated LC missions in multiple timelines. IMHO the multiple character approach already broke some sandbox  immersion."
"GTA London was a thing, waaay back in the day."
I'm sure Rockstar paid premium to get that spot.
That's what pissed me off too. A game taking the spotlight primarily because it's nothing more than a p2w microtransaction cashcow at this point.
Host can just toggle catch up off in the race setup.
I’m consistently not in first idk if that’s true lol
yeah and Mario Kart never does that lmao stop being so salty over a game.
Hahaha. Welcome to Mario Kart 64!
I think we figured out how the media likes to word things.
delete this
"At this point I spent $120 dollars on a shiny spaceship that sometimes the doors won’t let me open, or the landing gear won’t actually return, and the quests still basically don’t even function yet. 

But it does look pretty and the concept sounds promising."
When I got Fallout 4 I couldn't complete 1/4 of the missions for a month because of the glitches
"idk, I feel like they’re actually gonna try on this one, because if they fuck this one up, they’re pretty much done for as games company imo"
"I never had any problem with vortex, and I modded the hell out of Skyrim SE.  I didn’t really do much with graphics mods though, since I think they mostly look like ass.  Maybe that’s where people are having problems?"
"Weird, I'm on LCS now, an even earlier game, and the graphics look just fine to me (even pretty awesome, considering we're talking a PSP open-worlder).

Maybe it's the somewhat blurred picture on Vita that gets to you personally - after all, there IS a native resolution difference, and the image is still stretched to fill the screen."
"Same, loved the first two games, i loved the vigilante feeling in the first one, it's like john wick meets batman, i also loved the second one, it was different from the first but different good, i like the more comedic take on the story, seriously, wrench is a mood.

Can't wait to see what Legion has in store!"
"I'm kind of excited but I'm not really so hot on the 'play as anyone' aspect, I want an actual protagonist, if you can just play as anyone and be replaced by anyone I cant see how you can get any depth or decent story. Wide as an ocean deep as a puddle if you will."
Yeah for sure.  I want to get it some day. I love space and have over 300 hours in kerbal . It just seemed like a steep investment for what you get rn
I'm convinced it's just a long-winded scam at this point.
The New Vegas main campaign was broken (for me at least) before I installed the patch mod.
"It's more of a case that Vortex just doesn't seem to work right, such as not properly downloading mods via the ""download with mod manager"" links on the Nexus, which is ironic given that it's the mod manager Nexus recommends.

Also, Mod Organizer 2 does everything that Vortex does, but better, and with built in LOOT and xEdit tools."
"> I never had any problem with vortex

To my knowledge vortex being a general-purpose tool, doesn't have conflict detection/resolving. So if you install conflicting mods on Skyrim you could be fucked. Like for example items from one mod would never show up in your game because another mod used same slots for them."
"Yeah you can pay $40 and still get the same broken experience, I just wanted a shiny space pickup truck right off the bat."
"Yeah, I never had an issue with downloading.  I understand you might want more tools though."

Hawk, who hadn't used TikTok since 2018, filmed a video response.
""I just want to say thank you so much for the skateboard. It's on my way to my house already, and as a thank you gift I'm gonna send you my skateboard, this one right here that I'm riding,"" Hawk said, adding that he hopes to meet Cooper sometime.
Skateboarding pro Tony Hawk posted a video to TikTok in response to Farrar&#39;s.

>Skateboarding pro Tony Hawk posted a video to TikTok in response to Farrar's.
Farrar coordinated with Hawk to personally ship Cooper's old skateboard. The package is expected to get to Hawk's house on May 27, he told CNN.
Farrar said he was ""totally shocked"" when Hawk reached out.
""I had low expectations. I was hopeful, but I just thought that celebrities went swimming in their money and looked in the mirror all day. I don't know what they do, but not Tony Hawk, he's a special guy.""

>Mikail Farrar
On Wednesday, Farrar posted a video update showing Cooper and his brother Tucker, who is 9, with their long blond hair and oversized T-shirts.
""I just wanna say thank you for the skateboard and you're a really great skater,"" Cooper said.
""I'm a huge fan and I really, really, really like you, and there's a board coming your way, so be prepared,"" Tucker added.
Hawk later left a comment to the video: ""Thanks boys! I'll send something for Tucker too. And thank YOU Mikail for connecting all of us.""

>Hawk's package with three brand new skateboards arrived at the boys' house Thursday morning.

>Cooper and Tucker have been skating together for some time and practice every day in their backyard, said their dad, Robby Morgan.

>”They would be out there all day if they could,"" Morgan said.
The boys learned from their dad, who started skating with his younger brother when he was the same age as Tucker.
""We both idolized Tony Hawk. A lot of kids got into skateboarding because of him. So this is a childhood dream of mine,"" Morgan told CNN.
""Seeing the look of joy on their faces when they saw the video, and then when they got the package this morning, it's been surreal.""
Farrar told CNN he would be back in the Morgans' neighborhood later Thursday, and the kids will be able to show him and his TikTok followers their new boards.
We'll stay tuned for that.

Tony Hawk is a national treasure."
"Shit like this post keeps me going, it’s easy to get wrapped up in all the negativity"
Totally awesome all round!!!
Yo wtf I live in Suwanee
"Just curious where these video exchanges took place.  It looks like the FedEx guy made a tiktok, which someone tweeted, tagging Hawk.  Is that right?"
"It’s cool, make me soft and weak on the inside before a 12-hour shift in the restaurant business. I’m cool with it. <3"
That white guy in the video looks kinda like Tony Hawk.
Been watching this from the start delighted to see its come full circle pure awesomeness from the fed ex guy to Tony actually replying. I hate social media but this is wholesome
Why can't all athletes be like Tony Hawk?
Is Cooper really 8 yo? He looks like he's a lot younger!
"I'm not crying, you're crying"
Tony Hawk is a saint.
What a great way for me to end the night with some positivity in the midst of all the negativity going on in the world
"I friggin love the skating community. I was never a skater but I tripped really hard (twisted my ankle) near a skate park, literally across the street, and these guys came outta nowhere seeing if I was alright and helped me compose myself. Big ups to the support and stories like these go a long way for a lot of people. Thanks for this post,  I needed it this morning.

Edit: and Also bad ass of that Fed Ex driver. It wouldn’t have started without his effort just to get the video out there, I am really not trying to take away from his good samaritan lifestyle. Everyone in this video is awesome."
You are a fantastic person!!!!! Please keep being who you are!!!!
"What an amazing thing to watch! Tony Hawk you rock and mr Fed Ex driver, you went above and beyond! Now ‘scuse me I have something in my eye..."
Amazing human all of them in this video!! Thank you for sharing
"Tony Hawk is an absolute bro. And man is he good at social media. If you haven’t, check out his Twitter. He posts frequently about hysterical encounters where people don’t know he’s...Tony Hawk."
"This is one of my favorite stories of all time. Every person in it is just kind and wholesome. Not a single grain of doing things for the wrong reasons either. Only love love love.  


Have a nice day everyone, remember, there is more good than bad, always."
"I vote to make the FedEx guy king for a week. Tony Hawk, no surprise how he responded, par for the course for that guy. You just know the mom is awesome. The kid, too cute; so polite, so naive, he just knew that board would get to Tony."
"That kids doesn't know what he has.   He has one of the most valuable social artifacts of this century; an unbroken, signed, *used* Tony Hawk skate deck...

Grand cathedrals, churches, and temples have been built upon the majesty of lesser objects than a Tony Hawk deck. 

Cherish those decks, boys! Forever!"
You look like an older version of Kyrie Irving
"This guy should be a presenter, has a command of words and gentle nature that would work well. I hope something good happens for him too as he’s the person delivering all the good vibes."
FedEx give this man a bonus. This has done more for your brand image than your multimillion dollar marketing team has done in the last 10 years
Im not crying bro! I swear there must be a ghost cutting onions.
"Honestly you could rename this sub r/tonyhawk and it would be filled with the same level of wholesome content. The guy seems to spend most of his life doing things for fans, children, fellow skateboarders, people in hospital...the list is endless...while remaining one of the coolest, most humble people on the planet. One of the few celebrities whose social media accounts I follow because the dude is straight up dope. 

Kudos to Fedex worker Mikail too for being such a bro and making the magic happen!"
"""I wish i was your uncle or something""
""you kind of are"" awhhh"
"I don't know much about skating but whenever i hear about Tony its always in a good light,he seems so genuine."
Damn ninjas...
"What a kind thing to do, not only from Tony Hawk but also from the delivery driver. While it’s great that those boys idolise Tony Hawk and what he did was really great, the actions of the driver teach the kids a lot more in my opinion. You don’t have to be famous and rich to do kind things for others. Great post OP, thanks"
I wonder how many kids tried to send their boards to Tony after seeing this
MARKETING
"FedEx God-Uncle, Tony, Cooper and Tucker ‘boutta take over the Internet."
"This is great, but it feels a little like a viral FedEx ad"
you the man. tony hawk rocks too.
This screams guerrilla marketing to me. Wholesome and good for the kid but cant help shake the fact the FedEx is mentioned at any moment possible (including the driver deliberately showing the logo on his shirt).
Tony is a legend. I'm glad this kid knows who he is. I love watching videos where he passes stuff out and people don't know who he is. I remember one where the kids kinda like thanks for the t shirt and the mom runs up all star struck LOL
"Wish I was your uncle.

You kinda are now."
This is my favorite FedEx commercial
38 years later and Tony Hawk is still influencing the skating scene. Never would I have thought when I was 8 that my sons favorite skateboarder in 2020 would also be Tony hawk. So cool thanks fedex dude.
Tony if you see this add Cooper to pro skater 1 remake please.
Who brought in the onion ninjas?!!
"Meet Tony and his father back in the day when he road for Swatch at a signing. Not many kids knew who he was at that point and there was no one else there. He chatted with me for five to ten minutes while our pops chatted for a bit. Signed half a dozen posters and was so down to earth. 

Great human being, the worlds a better place with him in it."
Ok fine I’ll use fedex next time I ship something. You wholesome bastards.
"Tony Hawk is and always has been a legend, such a genuine dude"
"What? No trucks? You cheap bastard, Tony!

/s


^no, ^you're ^crying"
"This has a ton of wholesome content; friendly FedEx worker, cute kids and Tony Hawk. It's a boost of warm, fuzzy happy vibes for a scary time in the world"
I love this so much. These kids are going to grow up thinking that FedEx is way more useful than it really is lol.
Tony Hawk liked my picture on Instagram
Love this!
Aww so many sweet people in this video
Deacon is real!
LOVE all of this!!!!!!!!!
"more like a 3 3/4 inch thick boards and those are hard to distinguish in some places depends on penetration, which is how they don’t wonder at all. If he comes back from his 2rd war ."
delivery guy not getting enough credit here
sneak sneak sneak All to save an old la-dy
"Very sweet, and good on the FedEx bro for coordinating all of this and putting a smile on the faces of those kids and everyone watching!"
Omg that’s so awesome
Tony hawk is a national treasure
"I fucking love Tony. I always wanted to do something nice for him to show my appreciation, but that's unrealistic lol"
Sweet
Everyone involved in this video was amazing this is the shit that we need to be upvoting more on the regular... This positive vibe type shit...
Tony Hawk is a treasure.
"I love this video so much. For once there's no Karen calling the cops on a delivery driver, Fedex arent being dicks. Friends and memories were made, big smiles and adorable kids. Best video in weeks."
"God, I love everything about this"
I like Tony Hawk because he has a Mini Cooper.
"I’m not crying, my eyes are leaking tho"
made my heart warm.
how did they know about the 3 shells!
"In times like these, this is absolutely great to watch! Made my day!"
Tony is the man!
There's brodom in brodom in brodom here. Broception.
Aw the kid playing with his shirt cuz he was nervous is adorable
I always though Tony Hawk and Bill Gates kinda looked alike.. anyone ever see them in the same room?
Tony Hawk has made me choke up on more than one occasion. What a sample of humanity.
What a great start to my day man. Thank you UPS dude you're well nice and to Tony for making these kids lives. They'll look back in 10 years with some serious love and it'll probably go far in helping them making big decisions in the future!
Oh god this made my day. How awesome!
tony sent one too for his daughter... saw it on tiktok a few days ago...
I’M NOT CRYING YOU’RE CRYING
When Tony said he would send his skateboard I expected him to send it with the trucks too
"Okay, that made me smile!"
This dude has a heart of GOLD!
"This FedEx guy is an absolute gift to humanity, what a stellar dude. Seriously teared up at his unbelievable kindness. This whole video made my heart happy!"
So many chopped onions in my bathroom all the sudden. Damn.
I swear Tony Hawk is a goddamn saint. That FedEx driver is also one hell of a guy. Good stuff
Great post!!! Thank you.
But the boy was trying to get rid of his skateboard....
"My favorite thing about Tony Hawk is the fact that he may very well be the best real life example of the Clark Kent effect. 

Now it's not uncommon to notice the inherent absurdity of Clark Kent, the notion that a pair of glasses is enough to disguise Superman is pretty silly. 

Yet Tony Hawk proves it can work. If you were to take contemporary picture of Tony Hawk and show it to random folk on the street late night talk show style, you may get a few folks who recognize him but most will likely think he's just some guy. 

BUT if you took a contemporary picture of him *holding a skateboard* suddenly everyone knows it's Tony Hawk. 

If you don't believe me, try it for yourself with this picture and when people don't recognize him or guess 'idk, the CEO of Verizon?' ask them to imagine he's holding a skateboard 

https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F01%2Ftony-hawk.jpg"
Damn this is so wholesome
"""I wish I was your guys' uncle.""

What if he was playing the long game to hook up with Cooper and Tucker's Aunt?"
OP please share the source link for this video. Everything I find online is edited to hell and back.
Colby is going to wear his own jersey.
Awesome turn of events. I just hope the kids don't now get targeted by thieves.
"Kind of a dick move from Tony Hawk. That kid was trying to get rid of his board, but now he has 3 more of them to deal with."
BRB gonna go chase down my usps delivery driver and ask them to show Musk a picture of the Cybertruck for me!
Aww!
"When is FedEx going to make this guy a member of their social media team?

This was awesome."
*runs off with the board himself*
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY.
"I mean, yeah sure, it’s cute. *Written while sappy tears fall from my eyes*"
Skaters could teach us all how to love.
I just found them on EBay
Meanwhile my fedex guy won't even ring the doorbell
What an angel... the true Santa making wishes come true. Thanks for sharing this positive story.
[deleted]
"no such thing as wholesome or for know or not, doesn tmatter"
Tony Hawk just seems like the most chill dude to have ever existed
"What a freaking likeable dude

The driver, we all know the bird man is the GOAT"
How absolutely adorable
"Tony hawks a awesome guy. Met him a long time ago during his peak 900 days at a local skate show and he while doing some tricks on the street park setup he fell and rolled over to my friend and I and sat next to us checking bout his scuffed up elbow and started talking to us and then said how come your not out skating with me? He promptly invited us to go out and skate with him and the other birdhouse pros, was pretty awesome."
I’m not crying there’s a stick in my eye
"This is the serotonin kick I needed this morning! 
Shout out to Mikail for being a super cool dude!
Thank you."
Those kids are rad AF
This man could make documentaries lol
That one guy looks just like that professional skateboarder Tony Hawk.
"Man, that guy really looked like that pro skater. Im sure he gets that alot."
"We need more stories like this in the news.   Not as distractions, but as gentle reminders that people can come together in crazy times to change each other’s lives forever.  Nobody in that encounter will ever forget that!"
Hope the parents don't sell it
"I loved it when he said ""I wish I could be you guys uncle"" and you hear the mum say "" you kinda are"""
"tony hawk and this man and these babies!!! oh my lord there's just so much sweetness going on in this video :')

it's like a freeze frame from a hallmark card brought to life!"
FedEx guy - you are freaking awesome! You make me proud to be human! I hope I can do something this sweet sometime!!
That's beautiful.
Doggo’s like hunting but wholesome
"Tony hawk. Is. The. Fucking. Man. He’s did it. He made himself on his talent on a fucking skateboard. 

THPS was the solidification of his legend.  He literally just seems like he’s just such a normal dude, enjoying his ability to provide and inspire hope and dreams in today’s youth."
little kids got a thrasher shirt. these parents know whatsup
Such as awesome heart-warming story.  So touching.
This is absolutely amazing!
shout out to him and all the people that act like him. you guys are making an actual difference out there and you inspire people like myself.
I’m crying. This is so sweet. What a great man!
Kid asks for one signed board but gets three. Tony Hawk being Lady Galadriel here.
A bunch of nice people connecting:)
FedEx social media team salivating...
You can tell the kids are confused the boards don’t get any wheels lmao you can’t ride that
Promote this guy to a management position
Did the FedEx guy get anything for this?? I feel kind of bad that he did all of the work and just.... did the work for this kid to get 3 skateboards from Tony Hawk!
there’s so wholesome
I hope to one day be half the wonderful man the driver is.
"I'm amazed a kid that young even knows who Tony Hawk is. Regardless, bit props to the FedEx driver, and Tony. Good to replace that thrashed board! And good to see Tony still being a big part of the skate community."
Can someone tell me why they removed the wheels from the skateboards? Is it like a thing you do when giving someone your board?
There’s gonna be a huge spike in kids flagging down mail men wanting them to send shit to celebrities.
Hilarious and great that Tony sent the driver a board too.
This FedEx guy needs to be in the entertainment industry.
"What a great guy, I wish these wre the stories we saw on CNN, foxnews and in the newspapers too. Our world would be a different place."
Holy when he said he was going to send him the board he was riding I froze. That’s huge
This video made my day
This is the best thing I’ve seen all week.
"Knowing corporate America I wouldn't be surprised if the driver gets demoted or fired.

Where in the course of maximizing our profits does it stay to bullshit with little kids going kooky from quarantine?"
Awesome exchange all around! Also he could be deacon from king of queens for a reboot easily
This dudes voice is magical.
Does anyone else see the Templar cross on the skate board? I know I’m not the only one
lol these kids are from the 80's. Great story
"""I wish I was you guys' uncle.""

""You kinda are"" warmed my heart"
Sounds a little like Obama
"Some of these fedex drivers are legit. They probably go through daily stress on the reg and still have time stuff like this. 

Why can’t cops be the same?"
This is totally a FedEx add.
It’s like hunting but wholesome
The cross on Tony's skateboard looks a little bit too much like the iron cross.
No wheels?? Trucks? Nothing. Ok.
"Look how bad these foreigners treat out kids.... 

... how come People really think the above statement is true?!?

Edit: guys.. I am being ironic. Wich I was stating in my second line. 

Me as a skater i loved to see this guys ambition helping those kids reach out to the damn BIRD MAN!!!"
u/repostsleuthbot
His voice is captivating. I would listen to him talk forever
I think he received an equal amount of joy in return.  So fucking wholesome.
Promote this man.  No brainer.
"He’s awesome. Really went above and beyond to make that little guy’s day. 


Kids love delivery people. I used to be a mail carrier, and USPS/UPS/FedEx trucks are kid magnets. In the summer, when school is out, it always took me twice as long to do my route in certain neighbourhoods because of all the kids that would come up and talk to me."
There’s an earnestness in his voice and disposition that pulls you in
I worked in a small office with all women coworkers and the only 2 minutes of my day I got to talk to another guy was when the FedEx guy showed up. And when he told me he was changing routes the next month it hit me hard.
"Dude I'm in nw ga, I'll buy him a beer."
Seems like a cool ass dude. Not many would do that considering how badly those companies tend to abuse you.
"Must be nice 
Must not work for fed ex ground division they don’t pay there workers overtime so no talking to anyone for them !!!"
Good stuff
Yep. This whole thing is awesome. I’m sure that FedEx man has a name and I would like to know it. You rock FedEx dude. Just awesome. So good.
They are all literally breathtaking!
It gets even better. Tony Hawk wanted to do something special for the driver too and then sent a signed board to his daughter! That video is [here](https://vm.tiktok.com/J1PW1VD/)
Crazy how a little kindness can go such a long way
"The company loves this as well because their PR team can be ""Satisfied Seal"" with a sigh of relief telling corporate leaders their public image has increased."
Until a Karen calls the cops on him for harassing kids
"Next video of him, getting kneeled on by cops..."
Welcome to the sub man.   No matter how bad your day has been this place always makes it better.
"Check out r/mademesmile, r/wholesomememes, r/upliftingnews too if you haven't"
[here’s some more Tony gold for ya! ](https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephenlaconte/tony-hawk-recognized-twitter)
"Welcome to the sub friend. This is where we go to see there is still positivity and good people in the world. 

This man, those kids, and Tony are all a shining example of that. As a fellow resident of Suwanee, GA I salute them all and welcome here!"
"You can hear Mom reply ""you kinda are"" in the background, so I think it's official."
I immediately blurted that out when he said that. You don't need to be blood related to make someone your family!
I feel like he was trying to imply that an older relative would be way super excited about the three boards.
"Tony Hawk has been awesome my whole life it seems, I'm old as shit too! (Almost 47 now!)

I remember hearing about this amazing guy from California in the early 80s, but he was still just a kid! Such a remarkable life and a genuinely good guy. 

We're blessed to have people like him in the world :'-)"
Tony Hawk is great but let’s also show some real love to the FedEx guy. Seems an amazing human being too who went out of his way to create something positive.
So is Mikail Farrar.
"I thought I was having a stroke reading that. Good story, terrible writing."
"> ""I had low expectations. I was hopeful, but I just thought that celebrities went swimming in their money and looked in the mirror all day. I don't know what they do, but not Tony Hawk, he's a special guy."" 

It would be funny if Tony Hawk made a video of this depiction."
But are we sure that was Tony Hawk in the video.  I mean does anyone really know it's him?
[Cartoon Tony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMMHmlOExNQ) from Rocket Power set the bar pretty high. Somehow real life Tony has no problem clearing it though. The most skating I've ever done is in his namesake video games but he's always been a role model for me.
"> 6-year-old fan

Haha, I was like - 'That kid is *not* 8 or 9, that kid is 5 or 6.'"
I know. I really needed this today.
"The best bit is knowing these kids in 10/15 years time are gonna look back on this and be even more hype than they are now. It's a forever story to tell. It'll probably get them laid. 



Tony who probably doesn't realise it, has affected these kids and the massive life choices they're going to make further down the line. Rock on man, big up the FedEx driver for just being a straight up amazing human being."
"Same, always nice to know the wonderful things going on in the neighborhood!"
"Go mail your board to Tony, quick"
Did your mom recently make you send your beat up skateboard to Tony Hawk
"Tony Hawk has his own Tiktok account, he was tagged in the first video which he first responded to it by writing a comment in the comment section, and then filming a tiktok that I added in this video."
Sounds like you needed it dawg. Have a good day at work today man and don't let the small things make a big impact on you. The toxicity coming out of people's mouths are just the vocal version of the bad day they've had. No need to ever let that get under your skin <3 peace and love brother
no that's Cooper
I wonder what Tony Hawks up to these days.
"Tony, Keanu, Cena, who else in that group?"
"Tbf, if all athletes were like Tony Hawk, there would be nothing special about Tony Hawk (I mean, other than him being decently good at his sport, you know)"
"I have a theory. 


In the business of big money, these athletes are around some of the most toxic human beings to exist. Eventually, their environment impacts their personality and lifestyle. 


Some are stronger than others, money doesn't talk for everyone. See past the waves of horribleness and just remember the good ones <3"
"Don't worry, once I'm through with all the athletes there will be nobody but Tony Hawks"
"News articles are reporting him as being 6 years old (I checked, because he didn't look 8 years old to me, either)."
"No, he is 6"
"First of all: this is great publicity for fedex as well as being a feel good moment.

Secondly: my guess is he's not paid hourly, so as long as he's getting his stuff delivered and meeting his windows his boss doesn't care. And even if he is hourly he probably has time to stop for a couple minutes.

Can't be so cynical bro."
I didn't think that for a second. What a tiny view of the word
Thanks!  You too!
Or sometimes even *why* he’s Tony Hawk.
Sounds like him too
Lol how do you know they weren’t involved in this?
I fought them off lol
"Why did I have to scroll down this far to see find this?

This is clearly a marketing stunt.   

Professional video editing?  Check.   

Three companies mentioned multiple times?   Check.

Feelsgoodbro?  Check.

The only thing missing is a plug for a popular charity."
"Not a hawk, but I enjoyed regardless"
Dont spoil the dream. It's a nice story....I hope
Ohh my good that would be so cool.
I don't know but its too early.. damit..
Well the focus is supposed to be on FedEx as it is their commercial after all.
You instead could pay it forward. Do something nice for someone physically closer to you in an attempt to honor his example. I have a strong feeling he’d think that was the perfect thanks.
Lol you say that like it’s not legitimately possible that this wasn’t orchestrated *by* their social media team. His first video of just the board and no view of himself might be genuine. But it looks like someone made sure the subsequent videos had him in it prominently wearing his uniform.
He kind of should! I feel like he definitely shouldn’t gotten one for himself just as a thank you. The kid got 3. He got nothing.
Source?
This guy fights like someone that’s new?
"Yeah he did. He gained new nephews, they call him their uncle at the end. That’s priceless. Being involved in something genuine , wholesome like this is also priceless. You can be sure this dude is on many lists to get promoted just based on his authentic personality"
Dude anyone who ever has an interest in skateboarding knows the Hawk
It’s probably easier to ship that way. I guess wheels are easily installable
"Honestly they are probably the same. There are actually a few great cops out there, for example Cariol Horne. But there are a lot more racist, power hungry, loser cops and asshole FedEx drivers who fuck up my package."
"Thank you! At least the ones after his initial post of just the board.

USPS needs to step it up before these companies eat them alive."
"It's Independent Truck Company, that's been their logo since they were started in the 70s. It is indeed based on the iron cross -- sorta.

""...I began toying with the iron, or Maltese cross which was long dead as the old 60s surfer's cross, and even longer dead as the biker's cross. I used a beam compass to make it into a round shape, which looked completely different than the old square iron crosses... I took my idea into the NHS office the next morning and it went on the wall as usual. Jay and Rich each stared at it for a while, and they both thought that it looked a little too ""Nazi"". My sketches were rejected and I was sent back to the drawing board. I went back to my studio determined to use it, knowing it was the one. I searched my archives and scrap file for some justification for using the symbol. I found a firefighter's logo, symbols on the knights and Columbus sails. Then in my scrap file, under the letter P, I found a Time magazine cover of Pope John Paul from the June 18, 1979 edition. It was amazing; there was a cross on his vestments almost the way I designed mine. I marched into the office the next morning with the magazine to show what I thought was proof of acceptability. They both looked at each other and said, 'Well, if the Pope has it, it must be okay!' That was that, and the Independent cross was born."""
Well somebody doesn’t skate
Doesn’t matter. He got a board signed by Tony. That’s already extremely kind of him.
Fed-ex marketing team didn't have a lot of experience with skateboards.
Maybe put the mirror down?
Why are you calling this dude foreign?
He should be Morgan Freeman’s padawan. Also what an amazing gesture  on both parts.
Yeah this world needs to make it possible for this guy to be enabled to do these kinds of good deeds 24/7. He obviously is driven by being this kind of person. He's stuck as a UPS driver. This society makes me sad sometimes. This is one nice time social media helps out.
"""now, walk into that bank and take out your pistol I walked you through buying earlier. Raise your gun, shout some obscenities, take all the money and head outside.


Leave the money in the bin next to that bench. Now, go walk to the sea cliff. Now Jump! I will be waiting 200m down below, you'll survive....""


Yeah dude could do anything he wanted with me. FBI should look into this man, or at least we could make some serious dolla"
I want a bedtime story from this man
Has a great potential for being a podcast/radio host!
This man could read the phone book to Morgan freeman and even he would stop and listen
"Sounds A LOT like Howie Kendrick of the Nats, who is from the panhandle of Florida. Amazing. These guys should be doing audiobooks or radio, although professional baseball probably pays better. FedEx on the other hand..."
"He’s got a tik tok account that’s very entertaining, included the original video of him sending this to tony hawk/tony hawks reply and the follow up he seems like a very great guy and very funny, I would check it out 


His handle is @fresh2deaf"
Get him and Tabitha Brown together and I’m done.
"If he could follow me around and be my voice of reason, that would be great. Bye bye bad decisions!"
"People like him make life better for kids, and I'm so glad that people are out here making dreams come true. What a true bro <3"
Lol he almost thought it was cooler than the kids did.
"FedEx ground drivers are working for contractors and not directly for FedEx so it's not that easy, but yes."
"What if outside this one instance, he's a total moron that messes everything up? We might never know"

"You're not wrong, do you remember a year ago when those beer truck drivers talked that suicidal guy off a bridge in Saint Paul by giving him some Coors off the back of the truck? I worked in sales for that company and knew the driver and the driver helper. At our next general sales meeting we had them come in and the head of our state office showed the video and gave them an award and a case of Coors, he at least had the decency to keep the conversation about saving a life. Miller Coors sent a letter for them as well. I kid you not, the letter never once mentioned saving a life or mental health, it was all about them generating positive buzz for Miller Coors. They weren't impressed that these guys talked a guy off a bridge, they were just impressed that they managed to make a free commercial."

"Agreed! He is a stellar human. 
In the 80’s I had a Tony Hawk poster inside my closet door. The closest skate shop was an hour away and we begged our parents to take us so we could buy Vision shirts."
"I’ve never been a skater, but every time I hear about him doing something on social media it’s always a story about how cool of a dude he is. Two thumbs up from me."
"Where I live there's basically no skating community, and I never cared about skating, but I do know or at least hear about Tony Hawk, and that's always because of how cool the dude is."
He just did an episode of Joe Rogan if you haven't heard it. Also his radio show on Sirius XM was great but it's now over.
Or why it's him.
"I mean first of all, he has the same name as the professional skater Tony Hawk. And second, he looks exactly the same as professional skater Tony Hawk.

Dude could probably be Tony Hawk's stand in if he wanted to"
"Me too <3


I love you guys and no matter how negative this forum gets, we should always remember when we get off for the night that there's others who prioritise love just like we do."

You're right about the free publicity but man are you wrong about bosses not caring.  FedEx and UPS drivers are on tight ass stressful schedules.
I did in the sense I wanted to see the kids faces receiving the packages but not in the sense it's a scripted ad.

FedEx, no union, but if you're there a while it can still be a pretty livable wage. The only thing that sucks is how heavy/laborous the work can get and how long the hours can be. Often means frequent overtime though!"

Woah - can you do that? At some point in my childhood I was told not to store onions for more than a couple of hours after you cut them because part of their oxidation creates a substance that is toxic (not deadly, just uncomfortable) to humans.

I've always been eating all the onion up since then so as to not throw anything out, however I have never actually checked if it was true."
"There's really only two stories about Tony Hawk on social media: 

* Someone else posting about Tony Hawk doing something super nice
* Tony Hawk posting about people telling him it's funny how much he looks like Tony Hawk, or saying that it's weird how he's got the same name as a skater."
Completely! This story is true magic and I’ve never heard anything negative about Tony. Great role model for these kids. And the FedEx driver is a gem!
"Him and Mullen are basically the godfathers of skateboarding.  Mullen basically turned flatground in to the insane shit we see today in street, Hawk basically turned pools in to what we see on vert.  

Both are amazing individuals.  Skaters get a bad rap but even Bam Margera was a pretty cool dude despite his problems.  Literally left the gate code for his house (one from Viva la bam etc.) On Instagram and told people to come hangout as long as they weren't stealing shit he wouldn't change it."

no idea if it’s true of not but my mom always does this lol like she’ll use a half of an onion put it into a ziploc and put it in the little drawer in the fridge. she usually uses it next day or so but idk man i haven’t felt too bad lol.
"Not the one you're replying to, but I've been storing cut unused onions in my fridge, all my life, so has the rest of my family, and we don't have any illnesses running in the fam, pretty high life expectancy,  so I think you're good :p"

I feel there's a good chance I've been fooled. I have to give it a try.

Not every slot but every other one would work no?
If you live near any major city there are 3D printers you can use. Send them the plans and they’ll mail you the printed model.
It sure was
Lovely job
Oh shit. Didnt even realise there was music.
I turned my volume up... F*** you for telling me there was music
You’re probably right actually. I hadn’t noticed that it wasn’t completely every other slot in the video
It is already at its maximum capacity. The moment when you have three colors you can see that not every marble in the outer rings transfers to the inner rings as there is one marble stacked against and each marble from center and outer rings stays in its respective rings. Only after some intervals there opens a gap where they can bypass eachother. More marbles would delete the gap and you’d have 4 spinning circles without interchanging between the rings.

"He's not that overweight and being overweight is less dangerous for cats than it is for humans or dogs because they're nowhere near as prone to cardiovascular disease. That's not to say it's healthy for them, it's definitely not, but it's not that likely to be the cause of an early death."

This is so good. Thank you for the post and the reply as well I can rest easy now
So that’s what that rocket was about
"I agree, and I’m one of those people, but we shouldn’t be encouraging morbid obesity as a species."
"This. A human can decide to shorter his life span on multiple ways. That's part of the fun.

But a pet is down to whatever the owner think is good for it."
"Looking at the amount of whining coming from fat people about how fastfood industry is making them fat, I do not agree with your assessment about ”humans are capable of making their own decisions”."
Very comparable fat humans who are so fat it will kill them are told they are healthy at every size every day. Just because it is your kink doesn’t mean it’s healthy or good to glorify in the slightest
I see lots of fat kids too.
"I checked it out again and you’re right, there’s several posts that seem like they’re not trying to think their pet out at all."
"Look at the comments on tons of posts about how cute and funny obese pets are and the""I want a chonk"" comments. It's encouraging and glorifying obesity while pretending to care so you don't complain that assholes are killing their pets."
"Me too, gets my creative juices flowing. My art degree is paying off!"
"Enhance, my friend. Zoom in and you will see the banana depicted as one yellow pixel. Follow the banana arrow as a guide."
"The problem is, with all the life shortening stuff you can do, going out at the end is actually less fun."
I dont see where this is going? Your defending overfeeding pets?
"Exactly! The idea of the sub is anti weight, but people shower them in praise so they think it's a good thing."
"my favorite post on that sub is the one where it says their cat died from heart disease and the picture is a super fat cat and ofc the comments are like ""omg cuuteee"""
I could tell by the beautiful banana
"Art degree ———— paying

Pick one"
So no invading  Europe?
"Enhanced, didn't see the banana at first a big red circle could've been beneficial in this case, glad you're putting your art degree to some use 10/10"
Thank you
I don't have an art degree but I do have a beautiful banana I could show you.
"10/10 looking out. I’ll add another red circle around the pixel banana as suggested. Please hold for the edit.

"I dont consider it traditional abuse, but giving your pet health issues then being happy with how fat they are causing the animal pain by being morbidly obese is still abusing it"
"It is neglectful. Whether or not you personally think neglect comes under the umbrella term ""abuse"" is a different matter. 

I think we can all agree that no living being under our care should be neglected. Pets, children etc all deserve to receive the care they need in order to live a healthy life and thrive. A healthy diet is a part of that.

Edit to add: Going back to the original comment - I personally do believe that r/chonkers glorifies animal abuse because I believe that neglect to the point of obesity is abusive behaviour. This opinion comes from my experience of abuse and dietary restriction so of course there is bias there. Even if you don't agree that it's abusive, it's definitely fair to say it is glorifying neglect."
Neglect is a form of abuse yeah? If they're making their pet unhealthy by not caring enough then I think that qualifies.
“bad pet ownership” That’s what abuse is. Not performing the duties of ownership as expected. Owners are expected to not over feed their pets and make them obese.
"So really appreciating the help with the added banana and circles.  But I couldn’t see the other banana.  I see the banana and cat in the google earth photo (Thank You red circles!)... and I see the cat in the photo...  (another great red circle!)...   but where is the banana in that pic for scale?  It would be really helpful if you could add one and put a red circle around it.

Edit - just saw the red arrow to the banana.  Red circle would really make this easier for us!!"
Then a lot of parents should be charged with child abuse.

Ummm....   what?   I’m talking cats and bananas...   I have no idea if Obama really wears glasses...

NASCAR just took a giant shit on Trump and used a MAGA hat to wipe their ass.
Anyone that's still loyal to Trump will now view the NFL and NASCAR as enemies of the state
Anybody else wondering if this is all because Trump himself physically can't kneel?
Who does he have left besides the GOP? Kid Rock? Ted Nugent? David Duke?
"Mike Clutch My Pearls Pence is curled up in a fetal position crying under his bed.

He should be forced to personally reimburse the US for his stunt walking out of a game like a complete idiot."
Yup now he will be telling everyone on Twitter to boycott the NFL and Nascar....and watch LAW & ORDER!!! Instead.
"Let's be clear. 

 NASCAR and NFL fans have been and continue to be part of Trump's base.  Just because the organizations have moved away, that doesn't mean it has changed anything with fans.  If anything, the recent ban on Confederate flags at races has motived Trump's base even more by perpetuating the idea that they are being persecuted."
"I believe, it’s Time that WE as a Nation, need to acknowledge, this man at the seat of high office, who is mandated to be OUR public servant, is neither deserving of that seat, nor does not see himself in the light of that honored service.

His refusal to act on intelligence put forward to him of the coming epidemic and -worse than inaction, his constant pushing of his personal agendas in a time of crisis has brought us here to this tipping point in history, to this fateful DAILY reality wherein the very LIVES of those we hold most dear and cherish are on the line, and even past that to a future that so very precarious and uncertain. 

And in that aftermath of ALL the mistakes and missteps leading here,  not once has the man leading our Nation made an apology for his failure to lead, his erratic words or his complete inaction.

Not once has made of acts of Compassion or Contrition, nor shown any semblance Humility of Humanity.

We, as a Nation, do not owe him our respect or our concordance, and we certainly need to stop making excuses for him to explain away his many shortfalls and endless straightforward lies. 

His removal from high office was stalled by the smallest majorities in the Senate.  His absolution coming from men and women who supported him out of fear, greed, selfish ambition, or simply lack of strength of Will.

OUR Representatives have Failed US.  All these endless Polls and Pundits be damned.   

We need to stop looking at polls and look the truth in the eye.

We all know this simplest of Truths:  The man we as a Nation put into power is certainly not the man that can continue to lead our Nation by any sane measure or tracts of logic.  

It is time for him to go away, forever and day."
Does anyone else feel like Trump is now officially circling the drain and just sort of mailing it all in until January?
"Every time Trump (or a trumpet) complains about ""not respecting the flg and the anthem"",
[this footage should be shoved in their face.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxd_S1WHRCw)

I do not understand why I don't see these image more often. It was shot at Trump's private Super Bowl party at Mar-a-Lago in fucking 2019!"
"*As part of that, NASCAR issued a statement banning the Confederate flag from all events, just hours before Bubba Wallace, NASCAR’s only top-tier black driver, made laps in a race car painted with “Black Lives Matter.”*"
"It’ll be fine. Trump supporters don’t like football or nascar anyway. They just enjoy going to public lynchings, wearing white hoods and riding donkeys to their sister cousins house for a family roll in the hay.

Real reason trumps against kneeling: cuz he can’t. He’s too weak and feeble to hold a glass of water. Think of how embarrassing it would be for his old body to have to have 3 people lift his fat off the floor after his bonespurs flare up and he falls on his Cheeto face. Many of his cult are probably also too fat to move up and down more than their allotted once in the morning, once when they fuck a pig routine."
"NASCAR does what NASCAR does best, apparently: turn left."
"Dont worry guys, hes still got the KKK"
I’m encouraged by how much the public opinion has changed on this since Kaepernick first began his protests.
"So odd to me the people who have never served this country are the first ones to questions someone else’s patriotism and love for our country. 

Then turn a blind eye to everything else going on in this country that this flag is supposed to stand for"
"He may have lost the company NASCAR, but chances are he didn’t lose the fans."
"The problem is there are still millions of Americans that feel genuinely the same as Trump.  Trump didn’t make these Americans racist morons, he just gave them a feeling that their voice mattered.  It’ll be interesting to see how THEY respond

Trumps just a produced puppet."
"Hi, welcome to 2020 where every phone was made with slave labor and the term ""anti-kneeling crusade"" actually exists"
"100 million people watched the super bowl, that is not trump's base. There are teams representing cities, states and regions across the country."
Just a couple more until he never said it.
"NFL player: *kneels*

Republicans: *clutch pearls*"
You forgot Vince McMahon. Remember how the XFL was supposed to be the patriotism-signaling league nobody asked for?
"On a positive note, he got Harry Potter.

That said, Trump doesn’t give a fuck about kneeling. It’s just an emotional hot button he uses to divide."
"He's also lost the military. We may see generals drag him and Pence out of the White House in January, after they get decimated at the polls in November. Trump will sink to levels of weird and unsavory unimaginable before 2020. And, when that happens there will be unimaginable backlash from his cult of klan members and fascists."
"“Andrew Giuliani, a special assistant to the president who’s worked as a White House liaison to sports programs, said “there’s been no president since [Abraham] Lincoln who’s done more for the black and Hispanic communities in the United States than President Trump.”

Hahahahhahah xD

If pinocchio read this out loud, the tip of his nose would  touch the Sun and burn. Props to the guy though, being able to say that with a straight face is quite something. Fucking Asswipe."
It's more of a pro-racism crusade as kneeling is fine when it supports Trump.
"What do Trump supporters have left for entertainment?

It's just his cult vs. the world now."
Ugh NFL was never Trump's ally. See USFL
So much winning!
"Technically speaking, the left is and has since the 60s been crushing the culture wars."
"It's baby steps. I know people want a massive jump and I wish it would happen. It's going to take a generation leap or two before people stop labelling everything. Why does African American description exist? That just creates a divide. 

As older generations leave us, hopefully the next gens will be wiser, smarter and have more empathy amount them."
"Don't be mislead thinking this is some change of heart.

They are following the money.  That is the whole and only motivation.

Trump is so toxic, he's losing them money."
"I understand the NFL, but for Nascar to do what they did, that is an incredible moment."
"He didn't lose the fans, which is what really matters."
Minneapolis Police Union doesn’t care about kneeling either.
I think last time the NFL misunderstood the movement. I think they thought they were kneeling to protest America in general. Now I believe they understand what the players were actually fighting for.
*Everything else* this idiot has done was fine?  Please....
He’s flailing. The ground is shifting fast.
I guess it's time for Trump to try and resurrect the XFL or whatever the fuck because no one would let him own an NFL team. Yet another temper tantrum from the Toddler-n-chief.
Don’t all nascar drivers sit during the anthem?
Nascar is a bigger deal simply do to its fan base.
"I promise you the the new hashtag will be #IkneelOnlyToJesus or some shit.

There's a whole narrative about ""bend the knee to social justice warriors"" right now and we gotta call that out."
 NASCAR - Non Athletic Sports Centered Around Rednecks
[deleted]
"This story inspires hope. It means there are a fair number of billionaires who don't like Donald Trump and who, in their own way, will work to defeat him."
Can someone ELI5 why trump is against kneeling?
"Like he gives a shit lol. His only ally is himself at the end of the day, and to him, as long as HE is ok with what HE is doing, HE has not lost an ally."
"Alexa, what is a ""crusade""?"
What a wreck this popularity contest is. Fun to watch though
I’d say NASCAR and NFL corporate. The dumb ass fans will still be there
Trump will be jousting with windmills soon.
"Not sure how the ""president"" can justify his claim that kneeling is anti American and a slap in the face to our military but he is obviously not denouncing the usage and stance people take with regards to flying and coveting the Confederate flag. The Confederate flag should be a slap in the face to the American people and our military since the Confederacy stood for slavery and they tried to over take America. That is severely much more un anerican than taking a knee during the national anthem. And to finish with a solid point, who the fuck in their tiny brain thinks trump has done the most for minority races since President Lincoln!!! God damn this wrinkles my brain!"
"Maybe people who showed up with a note from their doctor should sit this one out ... or better yet, take a knee."
President Backfire.
"Your in a cold war with China , COVD19 is up significantly in Arizona and Texas (79%) the stock market is crashing as many sell off . You have systemic racism and a corrupt police force across the country . The world is horrified with every word that comes out of Trumps mouth . If his lips are moving he’s most likely lying again . 
Why he hasn’t been arrested is beyond the minds of many .  You are headed for a civil war . 
Black lives matter is not republicans or democrats . Take politics out of the equation and look at the problem .  America does not treat everyone equal under the eyes of God or the  law .  This is a human rights issue , long overdue .  Make hate a federal offence, the KKK ate terrorist and should be treated  as such . Long jail sentences for those who commit racism or hare crimes .  Again another man  dies  and a cop is fired ? He should have been arrested and charged with murder .   Trump has done nothing but instil hate and division .  You beed a real leader right now , you  may get sanctions fron other countries as Trump is a hypocrite .  George Floyd died for no good reason , thus is not politics but bad training, poor pay and hatred ."
It's nice that 'rump is focusing on the important stuff. /s
This is great but NASCAR still donated to his reelection campaign
"There's plenty of time to switch sides again, let's not idolize Nascar and the NFL as being part of the ""good fight"", they're just opportunistic corporations."
Perhaps this is why he is moving 3 carrier groups to the western pacific to provoke Jina.
Live by the Sword...Die by the Sword.
Because it makes them money to turn around their stance on this. Don't fall for it.
Do they have anyone left in their corner?
Exactly. There are tons of allies here.
"Rednecks around here have been against the NFL ever since that uppity fella with the afro began ""dis'reee'spectin' the flag!""  Here in the South, college football is king.  NFL a far second.  Now, if the NCAA lets its players kneel, look out."
This shouldn't even be a thing
"Unlike him, his allies have a conscience and also have the ability to read the room and which way the winds are blowing. This is the death throws of a dying dinosaur."
He still has the KKK and American Nazis so he's content. Very good people.
"I don't even know what the beginning of a golf tournament looks like, because fuck golf, but here's hoping the PGA pisses him off next."
Why are we kneeling for George Floyd? It seems messed up to take the posture of the murderer rather than the victim to protest the victims death.
"Why does that man always stand like he's the Penguin. 

President Donnie Cobblepot."
He is the greatest over-under achieving president in the history of the US.
"He can’t drink water. He is going to fall over and seriously hurt himself or worse if he doesn’t have anyone to catch him. Speaking from experience. My grandpa made it way longer than trump did, and I don’t believe that a 300 pound man who had had a stroke already (Trump) can make up the time required to live to 99"
He should have never been able to corrupt the narrative in the first place.
"Only a matter of time before NASCAR gets XFL’d. Can’t wait for XRRL, Xtreme Racist Racing League where every car is painted like the General Lee."
All the rats leaving the sinking ship.
"Not really.

In the magaverse, sports are awesome but they act as distractions to the ongoings of politics and how our local, state and federal government are being run.

Plus there are a lot of Americans who have low or are non-political, these actions force unwanted cultural war issues into their lives.  Add the riots and you may see an increase of support for Trump."
"If he calls on his followers to boycott NASCAR and Taylor Swift, he will have no followers."
"I always buy MAGA hats in pairs, that way I have one to shit on, and one to cover it up with."
This 2020 election just got kinky af.
We need to note that standing up for basic human decency is now considered a political act that forcefully opposes our President.
The business might have. Their fans didn't
I can’t believe companies in our country are disrespectful to our country. Black life’s matter and kneeling is protest and is an opinion and most importantly is a political ideology. And if you say it’s bullshit you get back lash.
You guys keep thinking celebrity endorsements matter. They don’t. We already saw this last election with Hillary. Nobody cares what celebrities think.
"The guy I used to work for *completely quit* watching football when the kneeling started. I say *completely quit* because every Monday morning he knew exactly which teams and players to complain about.

It might be safe to say that some of these goobers will still watch, just so they have something to complain about."
"Ironic that by electing Trump, he has increased the speed at which the world is passing them by. He is truely Making America Great. Looking forward to November"
"My parents have already given up on the NFL. Now they're considering NASCAR. I can't grasp how they continue to give up on the things they enjoy for the sake of something that only seems to bring more misery. I expected them to eventually recognize this, but at this point, it seems like that will never happen."
"Instead of watching football, they'll watch fútbol."
"Both of these were already suffering. The same people that support trump have complained that the nfl has gotten to soft over the last couple years, because concussions and short lifespans 
 for the sake of entertainment is totally cool. Trump himself had made statements about this. Same folks have complained about various rule changes in nascar and how the sport isn’t what it used to be.

These changes, along with other things like aerosol hairspray, make up his base. It’s the reason they like him, he needs to make America great again. The world is changing and growing, this scares them.

So yeah, they will boycott nfl and nascar, but they were already half way there before this happened."
What isn't an enemy of the state to these people by now? That MyPillow that does the majority of Fox new's ads?
"They'd view Jesus Christ himself as an enemy of the state if Trump came out against him. 

""So I think I've done more for the Christian community than any other president, and let's take a pass on Jesus Christ because he did good, although it's always questionable, you know, in other words, the end result."" 

Although I'd un-ironically have to agree with this statement."
Have we not seen trump kneel ever? Good question. Anyone know?
"Did you see the clip of his speech yesterday? Struggling to drink water, struggling with speech and struggling with low ramp stairs... Trump couldn't find his knees if he was asked to point them out."
"Then, how does does he knob job Putin?"
"He can kneel, he needs a crane to lift his fat ass up."
We’ve seen him lick Putin’s boots
He can't even walk down a slight incline.
"Apparently, he can’t walk down stairs either"
"If he kneels, he'll have to call the National Guard to help him back up."
putin probably has a pic somewhere
The man can't even drink a glass of water correctly.
"Scott Baio, Chuck Norris, Kanye, James Woods, Angelina Jolie’s Dad. His celebrity cache is righteous."
"Not enough. With them pulling out all stops to rig the elections, we need the whole nation to denounce him *and the GOP* without equivocation."

What about the NRA? I'm okay with them just imploding and disappearing though.
"Didn't he post some selfie beforehand to his Twitter that was like ""We're here at the Colts game!"" and it turned out to either be Photoshopped or an old picture too

‘Infamous’ does not equal ‘not famous’
With a name like that he must have conveniently forgot how Italians were once treated in this country.
Unfamous.

He got 29th yesterday. Strong finish.
I actually have the same number of wins as him!
Who the hell is that
Who?
Trump would be the predator in an episode of Law & Order SVU..
He told us to boycott the NFL a long time ago.
"He will bring back the XFL, rebranded as “Real American True Patriot Eagle League Football”"
Produced by DICK WOLF!!!
When COVID causes games to be played at 50% capacity or less Trump will claim it's his people boycotting.
"NFL is a lot more bipartisan than you think. I'm not defending NASCAR, however."
"The mostly rich, white faces you see at NFL games is a far cry from an actual representation of their fan base. The actual fan base is far more diverse both racially and economically, and includes plenty of people who would rather chew their own genitals off than vote for drumpf. The NFL will be fine, (as will NASCAR) without a bunch of loud mouth bigots."
good. do you think we can get them to burn their ballots in protest?
Ya these multiple billion dollar a year sports have huge followings but you can’t just say all NFL and nascar fans are his base. Just like any huge diverse population they have left right and undecided. The NFL and nascar fans who are undecided might take some stock in this. Every little bit helps the cause
Tbf they are being persecuted in the sense that they are not accepted as mainstream and pushed to the fringes of society
"True that. However, the base probably shrank a little this week."
"They’re being persecuted, phhht.  Because of a racist flag being taken away from them. 

It’s like “waaahhh, they’re saying I can’t be proud of being a racist asshole”.  

These pricks wouldn’t know what an actual right being taken away is if slapped them in the face"
That perceived persecution is a choice.
"Yeah if anything, NASCAR will lose money from those fans that waives the flag. Also do you think the police is going to tell a fan outside the venue he can’t fly a flag? There are 105 things that cop is worried about (public intoxication, nudity, etc) a flag is the last thing and walks into 1st Amendment territory."
"True. But, thankfully,  this election does not hinge on converting any portion of Trump's base, or ""making them see the light"".  LOL    It's kind of immaterial at this point in the election. All that matters now is who votes. 

 GOTV."
I remember when he sued the NFL and won....$1.
"Yup, watch the 30 for 30 on the USFL called Small Potatoes. Trump sunk an entire football league because the NFL wouldn’t let him buy a team. He tried desperately to force a league merger that failed miserably. I’m surprised he isn’t bankrupt, everything he touches eventually turns to shit."
I believe the people who live in reality as opposed to the alternate are aware
"Well, at least since they wouldn't let him buy a team."
""" It is time "" I was thinking that 3 years ago"
Well said.
I feel like he is just being spiteful now and will reverse as much legislation and sign as many harmful bills as he can before he leaves.
"Wait, what’s the difference?"
"I honestly wonder at what point he cuts bait on the election and just tries to focus on making his base more devout for the sake of grifting off them after the election. It's hard to tell, until he starts advocating for Trumptown in Central or South America."
Trump staying out of jail is entirely dependent on him getting reelected.
"Ay, love to see it"
So you are equating a movement to enslave people with one seeking to keep them alive......?
Maybe they’ll come around again.
"Or, doing the right thing and standing up for all people, not just redneck ignorant white people."

"Every phone was always made with slave labor, you just didn't know about it before."

They definitely were in the kneeling.
"How so? He literally had millions of supporters, as well as gerrymandering, redistricting, and Russian meddling. Asshole will probably win another four years"
"Here is a fun idea you go sit in a 140 degree car for 3 hours with minimal if any air flow and see how long you last. Then, if you make it, you can come tell us how non-athletic drivers are."
Being the useful idiot he is giving them enormous tax cuts and tax deferments I believe their is a breaking point but dont write them off until everything they own is at risk
"Because trump is a racist/bigot/white supremacist, and kneeling is in protest of police brutality against black people. Also Trump is a Fascist."
"It's been entertaining but a bit too much mayhem, I think if anything it's made people more aware of politics and hopefully that will bring about change among people who may want to jump in the arena with actual progressive reforms"
Millions of Americans still support him.
President Oswald Cobblepot.
Hardly. There a literally MILLIONS of Americans who support him
That's the point. To force Americans who are checked out of giving a shit about black men being murdered by my tax funded police to pay attention.
I think it more shows that they are not scared of him anymore.
What is it like gaslighting yourself?
If sports weren’t political we wouldn’t sing the national anthem for everything sporting event
Seems like rioting in the streets reflects poorly on Trump especially as he had peaceful protesters cleared for an awkward photo op. He is adding more justification for the protesters and more opportunity for the rioters.
"They'll drop NASCAR before they drop him. That's how much they love him. They'll twist the problem being with NASCAR, not Trump."
That would be sad but also hilarious if the thing that finally turns his supporters against him is...shit talking nascar and nfl.
"The old tswizzle, that is."
They love trump more than all other things. I don't think he can really tell them to stop watching football though
He already called on them to boycott Harley Davidson and they gave no shits
"honestly I think he's more likely to kill Nascar... I'm glad nascar is doing what it is... but I sure as heck can't be bothered to watch it. I somehow get the feeling that a better nascar, is more likely to join the ranks of the Dixie Chicks."
A maga sandwich
Thank you for supporting Chinese jobs.
"My father in law did the same thing, got rid of the NFL channel and everything. Posted online the other day that NASCAR is now unamerican and he won't be watching anymore. This is also the guy that told me fox news has gotten too liberal for his liking."
"Oh yeah.  That’s why most boycotts (regardless of who or what) are generally laughable in the first place.  Some will work, but for many, it’s get pissed off, then move onto the next thing."
Trump called on his cult to boycott the NFL when players kneeled in 2017.  TV ratings were not impacted.
"I legit haven't watched a game in years.  The NFL is a shit company and treats their players like garbage.

When I bartended on the east coast I had to read the sports section just because half my customers would try to engage me on it and it legit put them off if I didn't know how the Eagles were doing or the talking points about them.

Now I live in Portland and don't do a customer facing job and I forget it's football season"
Accelerationism in peak form
"his followers burned mail in ballot applications for voting - **their** applications lol

Thanks idiots!"
"It's one hell of a rollercoaster ride to rip that band-aid off though. I just want off, can't wait until November, and everyone REMEMBER TO REGISTER AND VOTE."
Trump is the squid rain is what you’re saying
"I believe this echoes what happened with the Civil War, too. By seceding, I think the Confederates actually hastened the abolition of slavery as they knew it, whereas had they not seceded, it could've lasted in the South past Lincoln's presidency.

This is not really accounting for the legalized slavery of the 13th amendment, but the white elite wouldn't have found that as necessary measure if pre-Civil War slavery were still allowed."
"You should ask them what they did to make Trump take football and racing  away from them. Talk them as if they are children and Trump is their father—after all, they do everything he says"
Probably not after what Gaetz said about the US soccer team.
They're are teams in Europe that overtly court fascist fanbases (particularly in Italy's Serie A). Maybe they should adopt one of those?
Wait til they find out that they're also kneeling in soccer.
American Ultras! Barf!
"he is a trump supporter, so I doubt he will  say something"
Someone should ask Putin or Kim Jong Un.
"I mean, I haven't seen many 300+ lbs people kneel in my life, unless they were just enormous people (6' 4"" plus). He's what, 6' 0"" at best? I'm sure it's hard to stand back up with all of that baggage hanging in the front..."
He would have to use his hands to get up I’m almost 100% certain of this

"Didn't Kanye finally come to his senses? I thought I recalled some long rant about how he felt his mental instability was being exploited and how he was planning on staying out of politics.

That aside, this one seems like a total non-issue to me. It isn't really falsifying anything. In the 2014 tweet he says ""Cheering on our Colts"", implying present tense. In 2017 it's ""Looking forward to cheering on our Colts"" future tense.

Can't really share a picture of yourself doing something in the future so I can understand sharing a picture of yourself doing that thing in the past."

"""Oh Dusty, INfamous...it means MORE than famous. El Guapo isnt just famous,  hes infamous!"""
Inflammable means flammable? What a country
"They tried to kick the ladder out, so they're in the club."
No one gives a shit that Italians and Irish were treated like trash in this country for a while
"Man, Briscoe and Munch - big fan of them."
This year love is spelt with two eyes.
The way you phrased this made it sound like Sam Waterston was dead too and I had a fucking heart attack.
The XFL was actually supposed to come back this year before the pandemic closed everything down. I only know this because my job was continually trying to sell us tickets because they got a kick back on sales.

"Compared to NASCAR?  Oh, absolutely.   I'd still state that the core NFL audience is on Trump's side."
Maybe as a whole but NFL team owners habitually support Trump financially.
"I quit watching NASCAR years ago when my favorite driver retired and never thought about it much until recently but I think I'm going to start again. 

I know it's a business decision by NASCAR, but banning the confederate flag for whatever reason is still the right thing to do."
one must wonder: how do the demographics skew based on fans who buy tickets and attend games and those who can only afford to watch on TV at home?
They could be told they are degenerates by NASCAR themselves and they would still give them money. It’s too engrained and change is not a word that’s in their dictionary
"Never ""all"" fans, but for NASCAR I bet it is a huge percentage,  and for the NFL it is probably the single biggest demographic."
Hurts dont it?
And destroyed his own league in the process.
He’s been bankrupt. 9 times.
"Better late than never, I suppose. But yeah, if _this_ is the time, what exactly was the tipping point in op’s eyes, I wonder..."
"“Top tier” refers to the Cup series which is the top tier nationally, followed by Xfinity Series, the Gander RV & Outdoor Truck Series, and ARCA. The drivers can bounce back and forth to a degree. Wallace is the only black driver to participate in Cup."
"He's quoting the article, and even that isn't equating the two. They are two things that happened consecutively and are related."
I think it was just more a coincidence? They removed the flag and then it just so happened a BLM car won?
"They only take hundreds of millions from the department of defense bro there’s no connection 
/s"
Jerry jones was his ally there.
Also lost in this is that Trump owned a USFL team in the 80s. They tried to take on the NFL and went bankrupt before the season started. I'm sure Trump is still butthurt about losing to them.
And he supports police brutality?
"I am not, just pointing out the other potential."
"I tend to believe that this is not set in stone.

As more and more prominent people publicly denounce Trump, his 'alpha' image will crumble and the worhipers will turn into haters.

This is the tragedy of the role he hell for: *(I'll leave this typo there, it fits perfectly.)* **Rise to temporary power through dirty means, then have it blow up in your face.**"
"A lot did, yes. But I somehow doubt that the typical Trump supporter (male, middle aged, uneducated) was really her target demographic anyway. On the other hand there are a *lot* of young adults who grew up with her music, don't necessarily have strong political opinions just yet, and so are certainly open to being swayed by her views. Even if only a few percent end up changing their mind, or voting when they otherwise wouldn't, or not voting for Trump when they otherwise would have, that's a huge difference for one person to make. And I really doubt she's going to cry too much for those lost sales (if there even are any), she doesn't seem the type to be overly concerned about money, and she has plenty already."
"I'm happy we are in the digital age, because there is so much crazy shit to talk about we would need volumes of books."
Same thing happened to Mattis. They're all against him now.
Gonna guess at some record profits and a reinvigorated sport on NASCAR's end. aka the FAILING LEFTIST NASCAR zero ratings folks believe me
Pretty sure sports are what we do to indulge our tribal impulses instead of war.
"""I didn't mind his racism, corruption, incompetence etc etc but the moment he turned against Nascar? That was too far."""
"There’s no way he is going to kill NASCAR. In a year, none of their fans will remember this and they will be watching the races like they always have."
the non-oval races are pretty good....
"If Brian France, the playoffs, stage racing, the Car of Tomorrow, and the high downforce package couldn't kill NASCAR, Trump doesn't have a chance."
I left that job before Fox *news* stepped out of line. I'm sure there were plenty of stupid rants about them though.
"This divorce is so weird, the Left is getting the NFL and Nascar and the right is getting Trans-phobic JK Rowling."
"I honestly think that he watched just enough to see who he should complain about in the morning. 

I had to have a conversation about politics being a personal opinion and that I did not give two shits about his opinion on the matter."
"But in a good way, not the shitty facist race war way."
What did he say?
Bending over is not the same.
He hasn't seen his knees in a decade
"As a fat man myself, it’s pretty simple to kneel and get back up, albeit a bit funny to watch I’m sure. The problem with trump is not that he’s fat, but he is actually a boneless sack of putrid shit."
He’s 6’2” (with heel lifters).
"It's well established that he wears lifts and [lies about his height](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enCA831CA831&sxsrf=ALeKk00MnBNWhWFLsMEm44esjdKSgrI-iw:1592144978433&source=univ&tbm=isch&q=girther&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi78vqewoHqAhWBITQIHVPFAIMQsAR6BAgKEAE&biw=1745&bih=852). His driver's license says he is 6'2"". He claims 6'3'', which at his claimed weight of 239 lbs, is just 1lb short of being classified as obese.

If he was a respectable and beloved leader that would've been a heartbreaking clip. But now it's hard not to feel malicious glee at his apparent mental and physical decline.
I love his acting and he’s hilarious on family guy but politically he is an air head.
It was said he was the most intelligent actor in Hollywood with 180 IQ. Looking at his Twitter account I literally can't believe that's true.
Ooh a piece of candy.
Whoa...
"Kanye dropped some cash for BLM.
I would be surprised if he was vocally pro-trump this time around. Democrats aren't running on taxes, they're running on social issues, which is far more on brand."
"I will never forget the look on Mike Myers' face when Kanye said that. 

I don't think it was fair though. It's more like Bush didn't care about poor people."
"> Haven't heard from Kanye. I bet he's consulting all his genius to figure out how he to come out of this with his holier than now know-it all faux genius persona intact.

Kanye has an internally-consistent ideology, it's just a dumb one. To use an (Unofficial) D&D term it's ""Chaotic-stupid"". Chaotic Stupid is the belief that ""Establishment = bad, and therefore anti-establishment = good"". To them it doesn't matter if what the establishment is doing helps or hurts people, it doesn't matter if what the anti-establishment does helps or hurts, all that matters is whether you're establishment. Anyone you know who supported Bernie in the primary, and Trump in the general is an example of this."
Kanye already gave money to BLM. Ge was wearing that hat back when but he denounced politics and his support after he realized Candace Owens duped him. Has he been saying shit in the last couple weeks?
Kanye attended the Chicago BLM protests.
There was a rumour a week or two ago that Kanye pretended to be republican and support maga so he could get some black people out of jail.
"Kanye may have spoken support for Trump a while back but I would not be surprised if that has changed. He's super close to a couple of the younger more ""hip"" pastors like Rich Wilkerson Jr. who are _not_ conservative people. Not in the slightest. So I find it difficult to believe that he's being essentially ""mentored"" by these people who he highly admires and is very close to yet maintains being a conservative despite the people around him and who are leading him being more or less liberal.

However this is completely anecdotal on my part and I may be very wrong."
Not John Voight the periodontist?

I wouldn't trust Twitter to uncover anything.

He has moved on to the church now. He just jumps from one thing to another like he gets bored easily.

"Meh, still not famous and probably never will be."
"I haven't seen that movie since I was a kid... it had a pretty similar plot to Galaxy Quest, didn't it?

Edit: The Three Amigos for the curious and confused."
Would you say trump has a plethora of losers rooting for him?
"Yes, those few years of being treated fractionally as bad as black people really did a number on the Irish and Italian communities. They still talk about it to this very day."
It was back. It had its season cancelled after a couple of games
3/2 of them don’t even understand fractions.
"I only know a few nascar fans myself, and they borderline mild retardation, but they aren't trump fans... they don't know anything about the political spectrum."
"I’d wager it’s pretty evenly split, a decade ago I think you would have been right. But conservatives will not boycott the NFL, they didn’t last time and they won’t this time, because they like football more than they hate kneeling.

So Trump will look foolish screaming on twitter about kneeling while the league looks to be united in allowing it, with many more high profile white players joining the movement."
"I can’t stand Trump, same with my friends and the majority of my family.  We’re all quite liberal, and die hard fans of the NFL.  I hope the bigots truly do boycott it this time (they won’t), it would be better for everyone involved.  The NFL fan base is massive."
"Yeah NFL games are all about muh flag, muh freedom, muh military, muh christian values... the propaganda and pageantry make me sick. Love the sport and the players, but the organization itself only cares about raking it in hand over fist. The branding sounds pretty damn conservative to me."
Not anymore. I've seen an ESPN poll that had an 80/20 split that agrees with kneeling now - and there were around 5k responses when I saw it. There has been a real shift
"Not mine. Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons and a few other local teams, is a life long Democrat."
"The NFL fanbase is more diverse than the diversity of the country, at least in terms of race. Gender not so much, but there still are quite a few female football fans."
"The NFL probably makes more money on advertising, merch, deals with sports news networks, etc than it does on ticket sales."
"To be fair most things he does go bankrupt.  Trump steaks, Trump Air, the casinos...."
"Yes. This is the guy who keeps demanding to dominate the streets and wanted to send 10,000 troops against peaceful American protestors, remember?"
Yes.
The other potential is schizoid and racist insanity perpetuated by the right and you help them.
"It's a cult dont forget, Nothing he does or says is out of line. Their drunk on their power of a guy who doesnt care and hes intoxicated by their praises, Hence the rallys. The question is what happens when you take Dear Leader from a cult? What's next"
"No, I can assure you the bulk of his supporters could not care less. Literally nothing will change their minds."
"His worshippers are not going anywhere.  Oh sure, some of the centrist and slightly right-of-center suburbanites who voted for him in 2016 because Hillary was such.an AWFUL candidate will abandon him.  But the MAGA hat wearing, confederate flag flying, racist redneck scumbags are locked-in permanently, no matter what he says or does. Cult leaders can always count on the simpletons to be loyal."
I'm still keeping a permanent mental note of those I know who are his supporters. They are not to be trusted
"I think it’s the opposite, his hard core supporters are so dig in they will renounce everything they enjoy to still claim trump purity. 

Would it surprise anyone to start seeing people having their caskets draped in the trump 2020 flag?"
This is why the only thing strongmen fear is being seen as weak. What makes it scary is the things that strongmen are willing to do to suppress that sentiment.
"Sometimes everyone is on your side, then they're not."
"Been saying it for over a year now, it's what pubs do, they did it to Bush too. The fervent loyalty turns to ""I never really liked him anyway."""
"I want to agree with you, but trump's base is made up of some of the most ignorant people on the face of the earth. Anyone who actually though it was a good idea to vote for him in 2016 is already a level of stupid that I though was impossible a mere five years ago. I think Trump actually could murder a priest on 5th Avenue and retain the vast majority of his base."
"What do you mean temporary power? Trump has been a powerful figure his entire life, and he’ll continue to be after he leaves the presidency. If you just mean his role as president, it’s inherently temporary, so what does it matter? And dirty means? The Mueller report ultimately concluded what, Russia bought a couple hundred thousands dollars worth of Facebook ads that weren’t even all necessarily pro-Trump, but more about heightening divide. 


I’m not saying this in praise of Trump, but look at George W. Bush. He was a much worse president than Trump has been so far, but he gets praised now as a good person. His brother stole the fucking election for him! Even the wildest of Russia interference conspiracies don’t come close to what W did to land the presidency.

"He's trying to pass a law to make the US soccer team stand for the anthem as if the government owns them. He rambled and used the phrase ""extreme wokeness."""
Gotta fluff them up first.
His knees actually go backwards
He met Putin privately a couple of years ago. He was surely either kneeling or bending over in that meeting.

The Trudeau pic looks like Trumps squeezing something out and it's had the Medusa effect on his missus.
I dont think his ever coming back to that show. They even took his name off the high school.
What’s great is they constantly made fun of him and still got him to voice the parts
"There are many, many smart people who have incredibly stupid personal beliefs."
"and a perfect SAT score, and yah I couldn’t agree with you more, he comes off like the dumbest fucking smart guy. 

How can somebody with an ability to think critically remain so steadfastly oblivious?"
You can be smart and still be a racist.
"This reminds me of my brother. He has a PhD, is very successful, was extremely gifted at academics, high IQ but his EQ is low. He doesn’t have much self-awareness about how his behavior comes across and why it’s offensive. He can be so immature at times, with a complete lack of understanding or critical thinking about other people’s feelings. It can be frustrating."
Ooh a piece of shit
"If ""candy"" is an underage girl, you're 100% correct."

So Kanye is trump? Wild
"He used Trump, threw away all of his MAGA hats and denounced him. Not publicly though. GLC said so a few weeks ago."
Is this from a new *Celebrity Death Match* episode cause that sounds awesome.
"I didn’t know what you were referring to so I [googled it](https://mobile.twitter.com/richardmarx/status/1241964647961354240?lang=en)
 That was a fun read"
That’s the one.
"She the one who fucked her brother in that one movie, right?"
He ruins everything.  He was pretty cringe on supergirl show and that show is already WBtastic
"Also his mother in law is a master manipulator, and I’m sure Kim picked up quite a bit of that. It seems on brand but also too sane."
It’s more a hope than me having any confidence in their sleuthing
"He won’t. Kanye is really popular on Reddit, and people will defend him for just about anything.

The guy announced slavery was a choice, and chose to full fledge support Trump, so Trump can use him as his token black guy to show he’s not a racist. Why Kanye is so concerned about always going against the grain, even when he’s being used, I don’t know."
"[here you go ](https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/new-report-claims-kanye-west-faked-support-for-donald-trump-to-benefit-black-people.html/) 

Link that explains what he did and why, idk if it’s all true or if he is just backtracking and trying to save face. Publicly he’s put down the hat and claims he was doing it to help get innocent people out of jail."

"it is possible to ""just kinda stop"" without writing a manifesto about it, dunno if it's true, just sayin'"
You think what he did is irreparable?  Not trying to argue; just curious.
"So the only reputable article I could find was from 2 years ago where he literally renounces the hat and his support for trump but it seems like he’s supporting him again? A little confusing. 

Contrary to what the other guy said I’m not some Kanye Stan. I like his music but I can recognize someone’s poor character regardless. 

What I will say though is he hasn’t done nothing

"Infamous just means famous for something bad. As many times as I saw this guy’s story and NASCAR’s response to him posted the last week, I’d say he qualifies as infamous now."
Still the only NASCAR driver that I’ve ever heard of.
"Jefe, what is a plethora?"
"Pop culture relatively commonly references how the Irish were treated, shit, it's a joke line in blazing saddles. And now they keep losing roles to black people"
Take a vote you clever bastard
"They know enough about god, guns, gays, and abortions to keep voting for trump."
"My neighbours are massive NASCAR fans and full blown MAGA types, at least one is, the other is quiet and doesn't speak his mind much if ever so I really don't know if he agrees or just puts up with her."
"That’s because the department of defense pays NFL franchises to hold these military displays.  The NFL fan base is pretty evenly split, politically, I think."
"But are the people going to game more or less conservative than the fans who only watch at home?

As a group, do the former have more discretionary income? Are they more or less religious? more or less socially liberal?

So many questions!"
Im not American but I really hate this guy and I really don’t understand how there are people that actually supports him... it makes me crazy
"lol, no, pointing out strategic aspect of outcomes is just a discussion of nuance."
"The Dixie Chicks were also a great example of pre-Trump tendencies that Republicans were already showing some 15-odd years ago. Because they deigned to not agree with the ""War on Terror"" and GWB, they were enemies of the people.

Thankfully they didn't cave, but doubled down and won a Grammy for their resulting work."
"I don't know if those two are truly comparable... Dixie Chicks were pretty big in the country world but only had minor crossover appeal. Radio doesn't have quite the same pull as they did 20 years ago, meaning station boycotts are less impactful.  And possibly the biggest difference of all: Trump's 40% is nowhere near the size or cohesion of the post-9/11 America fervor.  [They made a movie about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_America%3A_World_Police), even."
Pretty sure she has more than enough support on the preteen american girl demographic to make up for the loss of trump fans.
"I'm actually curious how this will really turn out, and it's not that simple.

> Cult leaders can always count on the simpletons to be loyal.

I expect there to be a divide.

On one hand, there's the wide mass seeking to follow somebody dominant, popular, seemingly infallible and able to get away with 'forbidden' things that others get punished for. For a long time, Trump did play the role and got the following. I expect him to lose that in a big way.

Then, there's the deep end. Here you have people who have publicly made sacrifices in the name of the true lord - with no hope of return - the westboro church kind of thing.

I very much hope that the second group stays small."
They named it Adam West High in honor of Adam West. That’s not necessarily a dig a James Woods just a way to honor a voice actor who passed away.
Ooh piece of candy
There are also a lot of stupid people that claim to be smart.
"It's not about his beliefs, which are horrible. He believes every word Trump says. You can't be extremely intelligent and not see that every word from Trump's mouth is a lie. You just can't."
"Did you vote for Trump in the general? Read the above statement again and you'll see it's more than just ""Voted for Bernie"". Here: 

> Anyone you know who supported Bernie in the primary, **and** Trump in the general is an example of this."
Oh dude. Kanye is exactly like Trump in personality. The only difference I see is that Kanye actually made his money by building a business where as Donald basically took his dads name and a few million in his dads signatures and his dads friends as bankers in order to 'make his first mil'. Then just relocated his dads business plan.
"That makes him worse than a Trump supporter. Vocally being a Trump supporter for personal gain  -- especially as a POC which is where Trump's lowest support it's found, so any celebrity POC support will be seen as a big deal -- is way more evil than being sold the lie Trump gives a damn about minorities and ""average Americans""."
"he ruined the OC, jk show was already ruined by the time he joined."
I’m a Kanye fan and I really started to fall off. Then he released the 4 albums in 2018 and I was thinking maybe. Then he went hard to the gospel and trump stuff. I still haven’t listened to the album and I don’t count myself as a current Kanye fan. I like his old music but I’m not feeling it anymore.
"Its part if being a ""genius"". Look at Kyrie Irving."
"Yea he and Kim only got 5 people wrongly convicted people out of prison, trump really played him."
">“I’m definitely voting this time and we know who I’m voting on,” he said. West previously announced he did not vote in the 2016 presidential election but said he would have voted for Trump if he did.



Hmm"
I know him for one thing.  Being a racist racer who never won a race.
He's destined for great things as an incredibly difficult trivia question.
I’m a NASCAR fan and I had never heard of this guy until he made the comment about leaving NASCAR
"Its also called carrying water, in your case."

"Dixie Chicks are also an example of actual “Cancel Culture”. If you aren’t on board with what the military wants you’ll be cancelled

"Funny, the Republicans want to talk about “cancel culture” but here it is fifteen years ago."
"I was only 10 when 9/11 happened, but I vividly remember the “post-9/11 fervor.” The widespread commercialism of it especially. I remember going to the mall with my mother, and Claire’s or The Icing (I think it was the latter) had several prominent sections of flag and army print accessories, even buttons dissing Bin Laden. Trump’s cultish base is similar in many ways, but not on the same scale."

Adam We.
He wasnt just a voice actor
Those people are called “stable geniuses”
"absolutely not! why would i have? he’s the opposite of progressive. why would people think a bernie supporter would like trump?

edit: shit, my bad. thought it was an or, not an and. lol"
The article I read about it said he supposedly did it to get people released from jail. So who the fuck knows anymore.
I will say that I didn’t like Jesus is King at first but it’s really grown on me and has some genuinely really good songs with decently thoughtful insights into Kanye’s personal experience with religion. I think “Hands On” is probably my favorite song off the album so if you’re going to listen to anything I would go there
"Kim K did that.

Kanye just spoke about abolishing the 13th amendment, and told crowds that slavery was a choice, while wearing a MAGA hat. Fuck Kanye, and fuck anyone who supports him. Dude is a piece of shit."
"Turning thousands of his non-political black fans into Trump voters was to the benefit of black people? I don't know about that one chief.

He has admitted to not taking his medication for his mental issues. He has been in a manic state for years now. None of it is a thought-out elaborate ruse."
It's a classic Yeezus move.
He's offended more races than he's won
"Kathy Griffin's huge mistake, she apologized."
Fuckin lol
"I absolutely positively love that song and still have it on my playlist, along with some of their other songs. Still my favourite Dixie chicks song."
Earl had to go.
I'm a big fan of the gimme gimmes version
"I was an adult during this time and while patriotism was strong with most Americans the ""with us or against us"" bullshit was coming squarely from Fox News. The crazy coming from Trump and his base these days is like that but on steroids... smoking amphetamines... snorting bathsalts."
Nobody messes with Adam We.
"Of course not, he was also a loving husband and father"
"Well, yeah, but that's what he was for the cast"
You ever hear of the Batusi?
"Do you really think he turned thousands of black voters to trump? I find that hard to believe.

I’m not everyone, but I would never vote for a political candidate because a celebrity told me to. That’s just stupid"
Bravo.
She shoulda just distracted people with a cutaway joke like her cousin Peter.
Me First and The Gimme Gimmes is such a spectacular band name I always use it as en example of clever names. Close second is my friends band from 7th grade - White Trash Can.
He was my sex coach
And Batman.
"Firstly yes.

Secondly the whole thread is about Trump losing celebrity support in the form of NFL and NASCAR. Unless you were under he assumption those were political entities."
"He has a cult of personality. The people who like Kanye absolutely fucking worship Kanye and verbally suck his dick about how great of a clothing designer he is. It’s $500 ripped plain t shirts and a couple pairs of shoes. Anyone publicly fellating this guys *genius* proves themselves a verifiable airhead in my opinion.

Sorry, forgot the point: yes those people would absolutely vote for whoever Kanye told them to."

"Something just like this was the first tool I ever used in Americorps. They call it a [weed wrench.](https://www.ecolandscaping.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/weed2.jpg)

I did a try-out day late in 2008 with my friend's crew, removing huge overgrown Roosevelt weeds from a retention pond near the highway north of Austin. In fact the pond was across the highway intersections from where the small plane would collide with the IRS building a couple years later. We spent all day wrenching those things out of the ground, just stopping for lunch and to watch the ducks. I think they intentionally put me on that shitty task for my try-out day as a kind of hazing. 

But it was just what I needed, and I encourage every young American to try national service with Americorps."

I woke up at like 4:30am for a slightly-drunk middle of the night bathroom run, was browsing the ol’ reddit lookin for a chuckle, and saw the original post. After commenting [This post was deleted] as a comment there, and thinking myself clever, I decided to give it a quick crosspost with that as a title, at u/UrsaIsABear suggestion, and went back to sleep.

Just woke up... it’s been 4 hours, the post is #5 on r/all with well over 10k updoots, it’s been given 2 awards, I’ve been invited to the Gold and Eternity clubs (which I did not know were a thing).

Brilliant titling sir!
"Sure woulda been helpful last weekend when we had to pull 26 concrete-bound steel fence posts out of the dirt.  Ah well, I found a much more cathartic method:

Smash the post sideways with a 12-lb sledgehammer from both directions, as close to the ground level as possible

Then smash straight down until you see the post drop about 6 inches.  Counterintuitive, right?

It breaks the concrete off the post and you can pull it out by hand."

"Ah that reminds me of using this cool lever thing (exactly the same as this but different aesthetically) when I worked for a company putting up huge tents. Used 3ft rebar poles, like tent pegs sledged into the ground and used this to pull them out of the dirt after. 
Another cool example of physics those guys used were these cool y shaped clamps, the main support poles for the tents could be up to 6 metres tall and with the weight of the material above and the softness of the ground would cause them to dig in a foot or two. So two people could clamp onto the pole and pull it out of the ground a few inches then walk forward with it to lay it down vertical."

"OP's repost game is on par. Reddit is 20% interesting material, 70% title and 10% made up statistics."
I felt the pain you felt. I walked that path.
Oh I am totally right there with you.

"I looked at the post, upvoted, looked at the title again, thought “if it’s been removed then why did it let me upvote it?”, looked at the title *again*, and wished I could upvote twice."
"Yep, took me a bit as well 8-)"
The tool all the mods want.
Confirmed. Mods are tools.
"Except presumably the post was in the wrong place, so this Mod would not be a tool."
"Depends on how well the post is sticking to the concrete... But with a lever big enough you could probably get it up even if you had reinforcements from the post to the concrete.

The hole might be a bit bigger tho..."
"No, this would not work on that. You would pull the concrete up before you pulled the post out of the concrete. And that would take an insane amount of force from something this small. I guess if it was enough concrete (more than people use to set posts) then a machine could pull the post out of concrete. 



My dad home made one of these once. I never appreciated the cleverness of what he made."
You can use a lift jack made for cars to pull posts with concrete foundations. They cost around $60-$80. You wrap a chain around the post and hook it to the jack. I found this on a YouTube video and removed about 8 posts that were cut at grade by the previous owner instead of removing the entire post. There were other steel fence posts that were much older and encased in about 2’x2’ concrete. The next door neighbor let us know they were actually deck posts. Way too heavy for the lift jack. I still have no idea how deep those foundations go. But I jack hammered the concrete to about 2’ below grade. Then I used an angle grinder to cut the steel posts below grade and buried whatever was left. I still have 2 fence posts and 2 deck foundations to remove. I found them as I did more work on the yard
Good fucking luck with that one.
"Probably way too heavy for something like this.  I dug out a 4ft deep post set fully in concrete. It took me two days of digging, thwacking with a sledgehammer, and 2 people pulling with a rope tied around it just to get it out.
That fucker was heavy even with most of the concrete knocked off."
I pulled some posts with my suv and a tow strap. 50% broke off at ground level the others came out with concrete intact. No doubt with this tool in my loamy soil would have pulled all the concrete.
"Depends on the material of the post. This will absolutely work for vinyl posts set in concrete and probably metal posts as well. I’ve taken up vinyl posts we a similar and more ghetto method before.
Wood posts would probably cause an issue since the wood bonds to the concrete better than vinyl or metal. Worth a shot though there’s a ton of variables to consider before saying whether it would work or not."
"Depends if they did it properly, if you throw a post in the whole and poor the concrete it’ll pull right out because there’s nothing for the concrete to grab onto.  I i drive a couple 10” nails on an angle from the base of the post to around 2 feet. If you do that and dog the hole like a cone you should never be able to pull it out"

"On a timber farm the rows are as close as trees can healthily grow. It's actually a bit crowded and they'll remove trees for pulp/lower grade products as the others approach maturity. The trees still reproduce though and ""volunteer"" trees may take between the planted trees. They're almost always included on any scheduled harvest."
They oak.
"Yup. Although mostly people simply stick these in the ground, and use too short ones too. Makes for a fun walk through neighbourhoods after a decent storm in the Netherlands. There's always poorly made fences blown over by the wind."
"If they haven't rotten much, yes they come out just fine. IIRC the lifespan of the poles is about 7 years on average. Especially ones older than that often snap. But it really depends on the soil and moisture."

You rip it off in 1 shot (possibly 2 if that thick lining at the very end needs a *slight* extra tug) or it says the opposite about you.

I watched the entire trial and it was clear Trayvon assaulted Zimmerman. Forensic evidence supports that Trayvon was on top of Zimmerman when he was shot.
If I killed someone I don’t think I could live with myself. Even if it was accidentally. This guy is so fucked up.
"Wait, what?"
This is why America will never change and these protests are a waste of time. Anyone with a brain should be doing everything they can to get out. America is a shithole run by racist idiots and the average American is even dumber and twice as racist.
Educate me please. Cause all I’ve heard was that the kid smashed up his head or whatever
"When you cancel someone, you drive them to the extreme.  He should be in jail.  But, what can he do to earn a living?  The act of canceling him drove him to be more extreme."
He tried to sell the gun he shot Trayvon Martin with online as a collectors item
This guy needs to walk on Lego covered in salt
Can't flim flam the zim zam!
Time for a cease and desist from Skittles
go where the money is..... that Mexican making bank off dumb wbites
"Gotta be honest, surprised nobody made him disappear."
He also beats his wife. Ex-wife? I don't know he's essentially a cop that never got the job.
"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Zimmerman

Just read his entire story on wikipedia. I am having an headache"
I've been awake for an hour today and I'm already done with the internet for the day. Damn didn't even get to check my email or r//prequelsmemes
he would probably be in jail if he was charged with 3rd instead of 2nd degree murder. George floyds killer is probably gonna get off for the same reason
Why skittles tho
Ugh now I'm embarrassed to be a south paw
Pew pew pew guess Trayvon jumped on the wrong Mexican
"Given the current political climate I wouldn't be surprised if someone used ""stand your ground"" against his sorry ass. Dead men tell no tales and he's already been known to be aggressive and makes liberal use of his firearms."
What comes around goes around eventually
He was acquitted by a jury... things aren’t always what you think...
"Another reminder he was assulted at night in a dim lit area and discharged his weapon in self defense, what his day in court and was found not guilty ... you know daily reminder"
">murdered a child

More like killed a thug that was slamming his head on the pavement in swlf defence

You can say it however much you like but it wont change the reality"
“Im a 2020 presidential candidate; I just put a hundred bands on zimmerman”
He must have some realllly good bodyguards.
"He did something wrong, clearly dated the wrong bitch."
It was set-defense but I get your point. Not something to capitalize off of
"Didn't the court, consisting of an all mothers jury find him not guilty and came to the conclusion that Martin turned around at his doorstep and approached Zimmerman. The two fought and the shot was fired when Martin was atop of Zimmermann?

&#x200B;

I'm not a fan of local maniacs playing police but if this is true then good and bad can't be attributed that easily. But either way the Skittles thing, the auction and his other moneymaking schemes make him a good candidate for this subreddit."
America doesn't stand for that shit dude. We look down apon it. I wouldn't stand for that. And I love my country.
"I wonder if George Zimmerman would be doing this if the cancel and destroy culture actually would have allowed him to get any normal job afterward.

Probably hard being painted as the world's first known hispanic white supremacist."
Well if he murdered a child he would be in prison...
He should be proud.
This should have thousands of up votes but it goes to show white America doesn't CARE for black lifes
"No he didn’t.  I followed that case very closely, all the forensics evidence supported Zimmerman’s story.  He was walking back to his car when he was jumped by Martin and Martin began to bang his head into the pavement.  He then shot Martin in self defense.  If he had not had a gun it’s likely he would have been seriously hurt or even killed by Martin.  Then no one would have heard about the case.  

Having said that this is extremely tacky.  Though he probably doesn’t have any other means of supporting himself."
Just a friendly reminder... He was found 'NOT GUILTY'
Better him doing that than being on welfare.
"Uh, how else is he supposed to make a living now? Not saying hes fine, just that hes so not fine that he doesnt have any other options lol"
Probs at least a day before he became a murderer
Because he's a sociopath with delusions of grandeur. So he is catering to the people that support him for money.
When The only people that accept you are confederate  losers
Probably decades ago.
"From what I see on his bio.
His mother is afro-peruvian and he identifies as Hispanic on voters registration forms"
Race is more fluid than attack helicopters.
"A lot of ""white supremacists"" are actually a lot more accepting if minorities subscribe to the same politics, in fact a lot of them will use minority supporters as tools to try and make a point about how their side isn't racist."
"It really doesn't matter to them. For a white supremacist, if you are a Mexican but you are doing their work, you are an ally (for now, at least)"
I always thought he was white. Quite surprised to see that he wasn't. Guy straight up looks like a Mexican gangster from Breaking Bad.
he looks like a cholo reject imo.
"A lot of white people consider hispanics to be caucasian. Not the straight European kind, but close enough. I only know that cause i grew up in an incredibly racist home."
"I think he got to be an honorary member for... you know...

RACIALLY PROFILING, HARASSING, AND MURDERING TRAYVON MARTIN."
The skin colour vs ethnicity when it comes to deciding if someone is white is one of the things that confuses me most about american racism
They don't.
Wait until you hear about Steve Miller
"Seems like we can choose our race now, just like with our gender."
"Funny thing, MSM and left wing shitholes like r/politics and r/iamatotalpieceofshit considered him white to somewhat ""prove"" that white people are going on safari against black people.

Truth is, he acted in self defense, and TM did not didndunufin."
Did he win
Sue the family exactly why?
Kendrick's Lamar bought the weapon and destroyed it on stage at one of his concerts!
"Downvote time. 

Imagine you are getting beaten in the face by someone so you draw your firearm and shoot the attacker. Then after your release, the parents of the attacker and media start lying about what happened, resulting in people protesting for you to be arrested and some even calling for your death. That’d piss you off too.

Edit: everyone’s saying he stalked him first. No, Zimmerman was in a neighborhood watch and saw a suspicious hooded person. He didn’t even know he was black when he started to follow him. Not to mention that if he was seeking to murder him/pick a fight, he wouldn’t have called the police while he followed."
That's what Trayvon Martin bought from 711 before he was murdered.
For real. There’s a lot of scumbags that I’m surprised haven’t been killed yet. Wtf
For the amount of weapons sold in the US there’s a surprising lack of justice being taken into one’s own hands
I read the Wikipedia and was very confused when it didn't give a time of death. With all the things he's said and done in most countries he'd be a wanted man too. Weird.
Someone tried to shoot him on a Florida hwy a few years ago but didn't spend enough time at the range I guess.
That's what Trayvon Martin bought the night Zimmerman killed him
"It's a very hard story to describe without pandering to one of the sides.  Read the part of ""Trayvon Martin shooting and trial""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Zimmerman

If you want a short summary, this man who identifies as Hispanic, shot a 17 year old Black child/guy (it's already hard to not be biased, so I'll spare details), he was found to be using self defense. 

But read and make up your own mind. It was a big story when it happened.


You know guys, Norm  Macdonald was critical of OJ killing his wife, but he wasn't criticizing him after OJ tried to steal his own jerseys. Zimmerman is probably as poor as a rock (he seems to be poorer with 2.5 million in debt), and making money any way he can."
"Very simplified, Zimmerman follows Martin becasue hes “suspicious”, they get in an altercation and Zimmerman shoots him. The skittle thing is because Trayvon Martin bought skittles before being killed."
Google it if you want facts.

Amazing isn't it.
He was always Hispanic lmaooooooo
"Domestic violence...twice. Dude played vigilante and only dodged sweet karma because he was armed.  He is an example of the 'why did my sweet granny die of ass cancer, yet this walking tumor still lives?'"

Without a shadow of a doubt.
Stay away please. Thank you.
"Not possible, because there’s a thing called double jeopardy, which is a procedural defense that prevents a person from being tried more than once for the same charge."
"we can't reopen it because he had a trial and was found not guilty, the state/prosecutor gets one chance (unless there is a mistrial) That really sucks in this case because ""guy signing stuff with a confederate flag"" (and didn't something else happen?) might have been enough to push the jury to believe ""oh he was a racist so that's why he shot this kid"" but in general it's a good thing."
Might want to actually look at the evidence and not just the edited NBC 911 recording.
"> Jonathan (John) Good, a neighbor at the retreat, testified that he heard a faint noise outside and he could not tell the direction. As the noises grew louder, he looked outside through his blinds. He opened his door and looked out and saw ""some sort of tussle"" where the participants were on the ground. He called out ""what's going on"" and ""stop it"" as he started to step outside. Good said the participant wearing ""dark or black"" was on top, and the person wearing ""red or white"" was on the bottom, and the person on the bottom had lighter skin. He described the person on top had their legs straddling the person on the bottom, who was face up.

> He could not hear any pounding or hitting, but did see ""downward arm motion, multiple times"" that ""looked like punches"" from the person on top. He heard a ""help"" from the person on the bottom, and Good said ""cut it out"", and that he was going to call 911. He went back inside to call 911, but he heard a gunshot before the call was completed. Good's call to 911 was played for the jury"
"Probably because you didn't read a single thing about the case other than the original headline?

Its extremely straightforward how he beat the case."
"Its sad what happened to that young man trayvon, you see I said young man not child cause that's what he was. Have you read the trail transcripts? If you did you would probably understand how he was found not guilty.I'm guessing you barely followed the case probably only what the media told you which is about half the story. The laws the law and in this great country you have the right to defend yourself. Also what you are asking is called double jeopardy. As far as what Zimmerman is doing here is fucking disgusting and one day karma will rear its ugly head but unfortunately hes not breaking the law."
They have.
Do you know what Google is?
I wish more people realized this. He should be in jail but they over reached
Read the thread.
"If you chase some one down with a gun, then you have started that altercation. If that person then fights you, reasonably fearing the person chasing them with a gun. Then by all logic you can't reasonably claim self defense.

&#x200B;

To put it in to better perspective, if I walked up to you and punched you one, and then you started fighting back would it be reasonable to assume that I had the right to self defense and it wouldn't be murder if I shot you dead?  


This is why stand your ground laws are such bull, because they offer a complete defense for murder. All you have to do is harass the victim into doing something hostile, and then pull the ""I was scared card."""
"After chasing after the kid and picking a fight with him after being told not to.

You nitwit."
"Pretty sure what he’s doing now removes all doubt that he was acting in self defense. Zimmerman was looking for a fight and got one, then he couldn’t handle himself and shot the kid. Now he’s mocking the death and profiting off, that’s not something an innocent person acting in self defense does"
Still waiting. It’s taking kinda long.
Try saying that about OJ lol. Good lord you people are tone deaf.
He is as innocent as OJ.
"Right wing idiots: the people are always right!

Also right wing idiots for 8 years of elected representative Obama:

"well it’s a good thing juries arent allowed to get things wrong. no innocent people have been locked up, and there’s never been a guilty person who wasnt arrested."
And? So was OJ and Casey Anthony?
Just a reminder that Zimmerman stalked and killed a teenage boy against the direction from the 911 operator. Trayvon Martin was assaulted and tried to defend himself against a coward with a gun.
Did he follow said kid around while armed with a gun? Did the kid think he was defending himself from Zimmerman?
It's adorable that you think the criminal justice system isn't a completely broken system.
"You White supremacists love talking so much shit, but when it comes down to action you are a such cowards that get embarrassed every time. Like I understand it must be exhausting to get your asses kicked mentally and physically all the time, but chill out it wouldn’t happen so much if you weren’t such losers"
You should have been a blowjob :)
Boi it's been up for a fucking hour calm the hell down
I'm sure the 14 year old who LOVES tacos knows a lot about the political climate.
Care to retract your statement now?
"Lol, so was OJ and Casey Anthony."
"In almost every other state, or developed country, he would've been found guilty."
"Your whole post history stinks, homophobe"

That's the problem.
Yeh so was OJ
Poor and stupid.  That is what you are.  Let me guess...white trash?  I’m sure you are.
"The piece of shit auctioned off the gun that  he murdered Trayvon with for 250,000. He’s doing just fine making a living selling racist propaganda."
He should be in orange but that’s red states for you
Maybe he should've thought about that before killing a child.
There are better options than signing skittles because you killed a child.
Or day after when he learned his racism could be profitable.
I didn't know we were talking about Ted Cruz.
"I didn't know that, but now that I know, it makes the whole situation of white supremacists paying for his signature even more baffling. I just think it's disgusting that they would approve of what he did."
"Wait what? You have to identify your ethnicity on voter registrations??? What kinda fucked up shit is that? Asking from Denmark.

Edit: Thank you all for answering. It seems that it is not mandatory to fill it out. So that’s good i guess. I still find it rather disturbing tho. Why is it important to know anything about the persons ethnicity? It should be completely irrelevant. Also one person said that there is even a distinction between race and ethnicity. It really is wierd to be talking about race in the 21. century. In my country there is plenty of debate about ethnicity but there is only one race. The human race."
"> he identifies as Hispanic on voters registration forms

Ethnicity is a separate category from race. He's still have to choose Hispanic white or Hispanic non-white. The vast majority of Hispanic people identify as white."
"I believe the saying is ""race is more fluid than Busch light"""

With the legal system over there he probably tried the it gave me PTSD or I'm getting harassed/threatened over it
They were complicit in falsifying a witness. The young woman that testified she was texting Trayvon during the event was not who she claimed to be.
He called the cops about Martin *then followed him when they told him not to*
"Check this out on snopes, I think you read a piece of satire because he didn't actually do this."

At least it’s not on someone’s mantle as a sort of shrine but it’s a shame George got paid.
That's really awesome in a symbolic sort of way but also that means he paid a large sum of money to George Zimmerman...
"Just like those guys who hit the jogger with their car and pulled shot guns on him. And then he had the audacity to fight back and they feared for their lives so they shot him. 

Seriously people, that's their defense."
"And then what... Where's the connection. ""Ooh I'm so pissed off I'm gonna... ::Squints:: auction off a muder weapon and sign Skittles for a living"""
You didn’t mentioned Zimmerman stalking Trayvon first
The fact that he’s holed up with a bunch of confederate flags signing autographs for white supremacists must just be a coincidence then. /s
Pretty convenient starting point for that story. How'd the conflict start?
Imagine being so racist that you justify the murder of a child.
He still pursued the kid after being advised not to. It’s important to know the truth of the story but it’s also important to recognize that George Zimmerman took a child’s life because he was being a nosy little shit. And now he’s signing skittles for people. A total piece of shit if you ask me.
"Imagine being a black teenager visiting relatives and having a random guy stalk you and attack you on your way back from the fucking CVS only to shoot you outside your family’s own door when you fight back.
Imagine this guy also called police and was told to quit following you but he did anyway."
Ummm didn’t he call the police and they said to stop pursuing the “suspect”?
"Neighborhood watch is nothing but a group for nosey Karen's any way. They don't have any authority.

Also how is someone wearing a hood walking with candy and a drink suspicious?"
"But regardless of what happened, anyone who is proud of murdering another person (let alone a child) is absolute filth."
"That’s just plain wrong. Zimmerman knew he was black and mentioned that in the call to the police. It’s in the transcript and the recording.

He was told to stop following him by the police but continued to do it and then provoked a fight. 

Its not the family that’s lying, it’s you.

https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/326700-full-transcript-zimmerman.html"
You're trash
You don’t get to follow and harass someone until they defend themselves then shoot them when they fight back.
That's what u think cuz that's not what happened
"Do you really not recognize how depraved it is to sue the family of the kid you murdered and sell the weapon you used to murder him for profit? Even if he felt justified in killing him, why would he be so flippant about taking a life?"
Trayvon martin was defending himself.
"Imagine you are walking home from the corner store when you notice a creepy dude following you in his car, you try to walk away from the road to ditch him but he gets out of the car and follows you on foot, oh my god he has a gun!  

Two options: you can run and potentially get shot, or try and disarm him in a fight.

Even though he is bigger than you, you decide your best chance to survive is to try and wrestle the gun away from him.  You fail and he kills you.

Then he sues your mom and sells signed memorabilia commemorating your death while facing zero legal recourse.

Trayvon Martin was the person that feared for his life and was standing his ground.  George Zimmerman is a stalker and a murderer."
You're right. It *is* downvote time.
wow. Just wow. You can go right to fuckoff village.
He called the police and was told to stand down and wait for someone with real authority to handle it. He ignored those directions and then killed a kid.
"Except: 

Zimmerman stalked him first even though he was advised not to

The kid had every right to be there, he was spending days there with his family

Oh yeah and the part where the kid was 17 and a grown law enforcement officer felt the need to use deadly force in a situation that he caused"
">a suspicious hooded person  

suspicious *how*? This was an important question that Zimmerman could never answer. He DID know the kid was black, that's what ""suspicious"" means."
He was murdered. You actually suck dude. You can’t really defend Zimmerman
[removed]
Yep. Trayvon whipped his monkey ass. He couldn't take it and is fragile little ego caused him to shoot the boy. What the fuck are you going to do about it
"It doesn't mean much, but here is my upvote. I agree with you."
So he’s a hero?
This prick should be in prison if this isn't confirmation of guilt...
Normal people dont go around looking for a chance to murder people that aren't like them. Zimmerman isn't a normal person in this regard. White supremacists and the alt-right are seriously damaged humans.
The people who buy the most weapons aren't the ones protesting for justice. They want fascism with the illusion of freedom.
They’re for protection not vigilante justice.
"Damn, that's really messed up"
By signing the thing the kid he killed bought at the store he was on the way home from? This is the action of an opportunistic prick.
Anyone who wants others to believe they didn't gleefully murder a child probably shouldn't be gleefully signing symbolic mementos of that murder for money.
So I'm supposed to feel sympathy over this dude doing autographs for white suppremisists all because he's poor? Fuck that. I hope he gets shot in the face.
A big problem with society today is that people are taking their facts from Google searches.
"I think I'll come back, just for you."
I know
"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/326700-full-transcript-zimmerman.html

Where in the transcript does anything make him look better? You've been acting like a doofus up and down this thread telling people to look into shit, when clearly you are living in a different reality."
"Yeah?

I have a CC license and was specifically told that no matter why I go looking for a fight, the fact I went looking for one at all makes me guilty of murder if my CC is used during said fight.

Oh well, there goes me being better than you and Zimmerman, you fucking trash."
"I followed the case extremely close.   Zimmerman hunted the kid down after explicitly being told not to.  He picked a fight with the kid, knowing he had an equalizer in his waistband.   He started getting his shit kicked in, by a 17 year old.  So he 'stood his ground' and killed the poor kid. 


In florida you can jump someone, get beat up, end their life and get off.


Zimmerman is innocent only because of a quirk of the law.  He went there looking for trouble, found it and killed someone doing nothing other than walking home from the store.


>in this great country 


Hilarious"
Great country. No justice? Tremendous.
"You got really technical there, I was just pointing out how fucked the system is. That there is “double jeopardy” and someone can use the law in their favor even if they’re guilty. And how there prob should be a way to reopen cases. Just sayin.  I don’t think you’re smart."
"You're right, https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trayvon-martin-wrongful-death-suit_n_3022300

But it looks like action against Zimmerman himself has stalled."
"Weird how prosecutors always seem to make that mistake, repeatedly, whenever they want someone to go free."
You're an arrogant smug midwit who thinks he's much smarter than he really is. The redditor condition.
">>chasing

You mean following a suspicious person (while otp with police) as a member of a neighborhood watch."
Where were you sitting in in the court room?
The stand your ground law didn't apply. It was ordinary self defense.
It's not archaic. It's new. Specifically passed to enable gun owners to shoot people more freely. Florida was the first state to pass such a law in 2005. Since then 22 other states have followed suit.
"Nobody made you smell it.

"I read in another post that diehard racists perform some amazing mental gymnastics in order to justify their thoughts and beliefs.

In this case, they probably think he's ""one of the good ones,"" because he killed a black kid. 

Fucking piece of shit."
"Race is a social concept, there has never been a white supremacy movement that hasn’t used an elastic definition of white when it suits their own purposes. 

But it doesn’t matter, and there’s nothing baffling about it. They like that an innocent black teenager died. They want to have that same power."
I know Reddit is stupid/blind as fuck but in actuality other races are just as racist/more racist than White people! Especially Hispanic community
White supremacists arent exsctly known to be thinkers
"I can explain this. He is ""one of the good ones."""
"> I didn't know that

Because the media desperately wanted people to think he was white so they could fuel their white vs black racism clickbait bullshit. They even lightened his mugshot lol"
"Most white supremacists are 100% anti-black but are tolerant of other, lighter skin tones.  A hispanic guy that also hates blacks is perfectly acceptable as long as he's not dating a white girl.  Aryan race dickheads are the ones who believe in the ""master race"" and anyone who doesn't appear Scandinavian is obviously the result of inferior breeding"
"Seems like we can choose our race now, just like with our gender."
In the US ethnicity is on a lot of forms. Many have a “prefer not to answer” prompt but I’m not sure how frequently people actually choose that
Census data.
"I have no idea about this. I'm not American, I just saw it on his Wikipedia bio."
"I believe that you don't have to answer that question, but it's one way they collect data."
"It's not required and you can opt out. I believe most of the demographic collection that exists was ostensibly implemented for positive reasons. For example, when they ask you on your mortgage papers the stated reason is to ensure equal housing opportunity and ensure lenders aren't discriminating."
It's so big brother knows whether or not to throw the vote in the trash.
"It's a bit weirder than that too. On our government forms there are usually two questions about race. The first one asks your race and lists a lot of options like black, white, native, asian, etc. Then there is almost always another question that asks ethnicity and your options are ""Hispanic"" ""not Hispanic"" or prefer not to answer. I've never understood the reason behind the splitting of the question."
Is cause for a long time the US allowed people to come freely unlike Denmark “whites only”
"While you are technically correct the US' federal race categories are:
Hispanic, Asian, Black, Native American, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and White
If you identify as Hispanic on federal forms then any other selections are ignored."
Yeah but youre assuming racists are rational and care what people identify as lol
They did not.
"Can you post a source? I tried looking this up and found that Zimmerman was suing the Martin family for $100 million, but wasn’t able to find anything about a settlement."
"What?  He sued them in December 2019.  It's way too soon for a settlement, and I can't find anything that says it happened.  Even assuming he had a strong case that would push them to settle."
If he was cleared of wrongdoing he may have claimed injury as a tort but that amount is a hilariously obvious publicity stunt
Why wasn’t that taken into account for the stand your ground law? Pretty sure those redneck father son duo who drove in front of the runner could have pulled that bs. I guess there was a video.
At shit. It was years ago. I hardly even remember.
It was Kendrick’s Lamar who made it up.
It was years ago. I'm not gonna fact check it. I have you to do it for me lmao
Might have something to do with the literal millions of dollars in legal fees he amassed and a world full of uninformed people that still believe the literally edited NBC 911 call that explicitly removes the THREE times the dispatcher had to ask his race before Zimmerman mentioned it and re-orders the sequence of events organizing boycotts of any company that employs the guy for stopping someone who is repeatedly smashing his head into a concrete curb.
Or that Zimmerman was on the phone with 911 and the operator said not to approach him till the police arrived.
So somebody following you for a few blocks is now a justification for beating the shit out of them?
Children beat up grown men now a days?
Imagine calling someone a racist just because they disagree with you about the happenings of a case
"“a child”, the guy was 6 feet + but the media only posted pictures of him as a little kid and played up the skittles angle to make him seem like a sweet innocent little boy when he had the body of a grown man and was legit beating up Zimmerman"
Found the guy that ONLY listened to the NBC edit of the 911 call.
Zimmerman followed him but he was not the one who started the fight he just ended it
"Zimmerman didn't attack him, the kid started beating him up for being suspected. If he was innocent, he would've called the cops or keep walking. 

He wasn't an innocent boy, he commuted assault against someone."
"Yes, and he immediately did and was walking back to his truck when he was jumped."
I don't give two shits about his age if someone was threatening my life then fuck yes I would be proud for defending myself
"Right, if he would’ve shot George Zimmerman for feeling threatened after being stalked for three blocks there’s no doubt he’d be in prison."
He wants Candace Owens and Ben to tag team his naughty patriot hole uwu
Pro choice? Lmao I’m a libertarian. And Ben shapiros ok I used to like him but don’t so much anymore. I also love the whole “ I disagree with you so you’re a racist” vibe
Thank you for supporting the case for self defense for Zimmerman.
MUH INNOCENT BOY HE WUZ TURNIN HIS LIFE AROUND
"Well, he murdered Trayvon Martin and got away with it so I would say signing skittles isn't actually that bad by comparison to his actual crimes."
Ikr! Soure skittles and sweet tea?!
"IIRC the media smeared Martin because Skittles apparently is an additive for some kind of cough syrup concoction that gets people high. 

Even though he wasn't carrying the cough syrup which, you know, does the heavy lifting as far as getting you high."
"Why is it sad? Trayvon was a piece of shit like Zimmerman. Both look for trouble and they found each other, trevon was expelled from school for violence."
that 'memorial' sounds quite shabby lol
"He wasn’t accused of killing him and it fell through, he did and no one has ever said otherwise, but he and his “fans” claim it was justified. All this is is confirmation he’s a complete piece of shit."
The last few weeks of reading right wing subs/forums/fbgroups have really opened my eyes to how many people on the right want to be Subjects rather than Citizens.
"What? No, sorry, this is absolutely false. I own a significant amount of firearms, and  I've been out protesting. Just because I own guns, does not make me a fascist. Fuck outta here with that shit."
Or the vast majority of people who buy firearms are law abiding citizens that don’t believe in vigilante justice? Lmfao you people are just too much.
I have 10 guns and I support the protests.  You should arm yourself if you truly believe what you say.
"Yes, biblical eye for an eye style justice i.e. revenge ... how someone has not put a cap in his ass baffles me (same goes for a lot of the pieces of shit we see in the news at various levels of society and government)."
I know that’s what they’re “for”... but looking at the shooting stats in the US it’s safe to assume people bend the rules from time to time

">In florida you can jump someone, get beat up, end their life and get off.

Wrong

Florida’s “Stand-Your-Ground” law states, “A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.” How would you put this law in your own words?

Jumping someone would be unlawfully activity. Also fyi Florida is one of many states with stand your ground law. 

>Zimmerman is innocent only because of a quirk of the law. 

That same law that 27 other states have."
"> Zimmerman is innocent only because of a quirk of the law.

Self defense isn't ""a quirk of the law."""
"Holy fuck no you didn't. Everything you just mentioned was a lie.

Zimmerman stopped pursuing when the police told him to.

Martin left and then came back and attacked Zimmerman. Smashed his head into the pavement and beat him while he was on the ground.

The key point is that Martin not only left the area, but returned and started a physical confrontation.

Edit: People downvoting me. You're pathetic. Stop believing bullshit narratives and read the fucking court transcripts. We know all of this information already."
Stand your ground is a great law and he used it. Don't street fight someone because you never know what they're packing. I don't feel bad because a kid decided to get provoked into a fight.
How many countries have you been to?
There should absolutely not be a way to reopen cases. Not being tried for the same case twice is literally a consitutional right.

"> Race is a social concept, there has never been a white supremacy movement that hasn’t used an elastic definition of white when it suits their own purposes. 

I don't disagree, but wouldn't you say we see progressives do this a lot with their moving definition of POC? I mean, I recognize progressives as being racist when they do shit like that, but I wonder if they do..?"
"Ok, but that has nothing to do with why white supremacists would like a Hispanic guy."
I always choose that. I don't understand why they ask still.
"Well you can be Hispanic ethnicity and be of pretty much any race. My mom is a lily white lady but she’s still Hispanic. We have a lot of Afro-Latinos, Asian-Latinos, and Arab-Latinos spread across central and South American and across the Caribbean."

"> I fucking hate people who call out that they’ll get downvotes as though it’s some badge of honor. I don’t know why it makes me so annoyed but I feel confident in saying they’re the absolute worst.

"I just read through that whole wiki page because I didn't know anything besides him shooting that kid. He is a piece of shit, racist, what-other-countries-hate-about-americans type of trash.

Zimmerman is garbage and totally has it out that he can just do whatever he wants...."
"nah you’re just a racist piece of shit. you don’t have a hot take, you’re just wrong and want to be edgy because you’re again, a racist piece of shit"
"> the guy was 6 feet + 

That's weird, it says he was 5'11. Not sure how that's 6ft+ but whatever makes you feel better. Or maybe it's an alternative fact, again not sure how you came to 6ft+. 

I understand George was a big ol' fatass and pretty short so everything seems bigger and scarier from down there, but why fabricate the story?

Fatboy Zimmerman didn't know how to fight and couldn't finish the fight he started so he killed a 17 year old. 

But yeah dude Trayvon was like 6'7 350 pounds of pure muscle and a 4 time black belt at 17 years old."
"If Trayvon felt like his life was in danger because some man was following him with a gun, according to Stand Your Ground, it was legal for him to defend himself however necessary. Imagine you’re walking hone at night and some random guy pulls a gun on you and tries to arrest you. Fighting back is an appropriate response. If Zimmerman had stayed in his vehicle, or listened to dispatch’s instructions, this would’ve been a non issue, and Trayvon would be alive."
That’s what Zimmerman told us.
SO of course he deserved to die! Only Jesus levels of purity are allowed here
Maybe learn how to speak English first before contributing in big boy conversations
Okay so imagine you are being followed by a stranger in the dark on your way home to your dad’s house and you get a chance to defend yourself. You are okay with the stalker shooting you to death? Cool. See you in hell.
Yes but the person said murder. Murder is not defending yourself. I’d also be proud to defend myself. No one should be proud of murder.
"Zimmerman stalked him, attacked him, and then killed Trayvon when he fought back. He was 12 years old! How can you defend this man?! Just admit you're a biased racist coward and move on"
"No, you literally don’t.  Don’t let Florida’s stellar track record of getting it wrong sway your opinion.  I don’t get to claim “stand your ground” when I’m the one initiating the conflict.  And do you really think it went from following to getting beat up without any in between?  How does Zimmerman get within ass whopping range if he’s “just following him?”"
You sound like someone who would justify and defend stalking. Yikes.
"oh, you mean the guy who confronted a kid with a loaded weapon for absolutely no reason?"
"Actually Zimmerman was acquitted, and was injured by  Martin in a confrontation, he didn’t murder him he shot him."
What about all the previous incidents of violence from Trayvon?  Did that smear him too or just the imaginary shit you made up
Oh... You’re *that* person.
They were children
the kid was 12 lol you that low of a POS my dude?
"Well--  

You have people who polish up their favorite automatic pew-pew, dress up in their their best Duck Dynasty/ G.I. Joe outfit, and protest duh gub'ment because wearing masks to spread the infection of a deadly disease is an unconstitutional abuse of their human rights, apparently...   

And then those same shithead hillbillies will watch a policeman with his knee on George Floyd's neck and say ""well he'd still be alive if he would have obeyed the government.""     

Does that make fucking sense?"
Whoever bought it should have shot that fucker in the face with his own gun.
And what’s wrong exactly with asking for details on what happened? I doubt the concept of google was so foreign to them that they desperately wanted to know but couldn’t find out. I doubt it’s something they were thinking of 10 seconds later. It’s a weird thing to rally against regardless.
"Oh that's complete bullshit, the transcript of the 911 call shows that Zimmerman DID keep following Trayvon. I've read the transcript, you're trying to justify murder"
"Kid didn’t get provoked into a fight. A threatening man was following him. He was defending himself. 

The man is a murder. How the fuck can you defend that shit? It’s not like Trayvon broke into a house. The dude was being stalked like an animal and you have the idiocy to claim otherwise?


And anyways that’s not the purpose of the law. Can you imagine how many bar fights would end up in murder because someone got “provoked”?  Anyways I hope you learned something today. I hope you have a good time blowing your dad all day."
Yeh pull out your gun when you’re a grown ass man looking for a fight and get your ass beat by a teenager with his fists. Zimmerman is a bitch and so are you
"Eh i disagree with it, even if more evidence is found a case could not be retried. Even if they had a video of the person it could not be re opened. Sound like bs. I don’t think that was the intended use of that right."
"Caring that much about gay people, you're like, letting gay people determine how you live your life, which is in itself, pretty gay"
He’s profiting from murder it’s hard to do that in societies that aren’t completely money based (unless it is a dictatorship)
"I have literally heard the sports thing justified by people saying that it's no different that pulling for a race horse that you own to win the Kentucky Derby.  (yes, I've hung out with some ""amazing"" people in my life)"
"The mouthpieces are smart, the ones following them are stupid."
"^ Imagine being such a giant wagon of douche that you would compare Zimmerman to Candace Owens. ^

You're a race-obsessed communist crust punk, have a little shame. You have no right to talk about anyone else's character, intelligence, or sincerity. Candace Owens never hurt anyone except your feelings."
"Demographics, supposedly. But the vast majority of the time I see the question I have to wonder who is measuring the demographics there and why, and I usually can’t see a good reason."
The Internet!
Welcome to reddit/the internet/any chapter in a history book.
Is there any consensus that Jesus is or isn’t real? I don’t think it’s as clear cut as gay unicorns.
">If Trayvon felt like his life was in danger because some man was following him with a gun, according to Stand Your Ground, it was legal for him to defend himself however necessary. 

Lmfao. That is complete bullshit and I sincerely hope you weren't given this as legal advice. No, you cannot beat the shit out of somebody if they are following you."
And every piece of evidence in the trial that proved Zimmerman was telling the truth.
"See how you bought into the fake news? He wa 17 almost an adult, not 12 but because they were showing his pictures as a kid you thought he was 12"
Wait what... where did you get the idea that he was 12 years old?
Who was 12?
He was actual 17. But I guess the propaganda worked eh?
"Aaaand my reading stops at Automatic.

Barely any civilians have automatic guns, and those that do don't flaunt around their $40000.

Also these are all totally the same people."
"> automatic 


Yeah, you don’t know what you’re talking about"
Then fill his mouth with Skittles.
"[Actually here's the full transcript](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/326700-full-transcript-zimmerman.html)

Find me anything that indicates he continued to follow."
"Quote the 911 call. There is literally nothing in there about him continuing to follow him. He returns to his vehicle. This is, again, well documented."
">Kid didn’t get provoked into a fight. A threatening man was following him. He was defending himself. 

Lmfao. What an absurd standard. So when somebody follows you for a couple of blocks you now have the right to smash his skull into the pavement and pummel him while he is on the ground?"
The intended use of the right is that you can't face the same charges over and over again and get fucked by the legal system. Just because sometimes the police don't get a criminal doesn't mean we need to begin eroding constitutional rights. That opens up abuse.
God racists are such whiny bitches
That doesn’t make him signing bags of skittles in a room full of confederate flags okay.
"There’s plenty of good examples of self defense. This coward just shot a defenseless kid. Remember, being a racist is exhausting. Anytime you want to join the future, you’ll be welcome,"
"“A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.”

That’s literally the law. Trayvon Martin was not breaking the law, and he was attacked. The law is fucking stupid. Don’t try and be a cop if you’re not a cop. We only know half of the story, and so if George Zimmerman approaches Trayvon in a threatening manner, for instance with his gun drawn, that would make it completely legal for him to fight back."
"Regardless of his age, he was unjustly murdered, and there was no justice for it."
He was 17?  Then I guess he deserved it.  If he was 12 it would be a different story!
Man now I want someone to load up a 12ga shell with skittles and make Zimmerman lose his mind with it.
Ok you win
">“A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.”

The key word here is ""attacked"". Walking behind you isn't an attack. 

>That’s literally the law. Trayvon Martin was not breaking the law, and he was attacked.

How? How did Zimmerman attack him?

>The law is fucking stupid. Don’t try and be a cop if you’re not a cop. We only know half of the story, and so if George Zimmerman approaches Trayvon in a threatening manner, for instance with his gun drawn, that would make it completely legal for him to fight back.

Do you have any evidence that Zimmerman brandished his firearm?"
Funny I guess you can read words that aren’t there. I never said that.

Quality meme.
"“One of my favourite Steve Jobs stories was the time the engineers working on the iPod brought their finished prototype to him in his office. He said it was too big, they needed to make it smaller. They said it was as small as they could make it, it couldn’t be made any smaller. So he took the prototype over to his aquarium and dropped it in. The iPod sank to the bottom, and as it did, tiny little bubbles came out. ‘See those bubbles,’ he asked. ‘They’re air inside the iPod. Make it smaller.’

“Another story about Steve Jobs was when they brought the prototype for the iPad 2 to his office. The engineers told him it was faster than the first iPad. He took it over to his aquarium and dropped it in. ‘Look how slowly it sank,’ he told them. ‘Make it faster.’

“One time a newly hired intern had been sent out to get Steve a sandwich. When she brought it to him, he looked at it. ‘I thought I ordered the beef on rye,’ he asked. She told him it was indeed beef on rye. He took it over to his fish tank and dropped it in. ‘Does that look like beef on rye?’

“He was always dropping things in that fish tank. We couldn’t stop him. We told him he had to stop, he wouldn’t listen. It was full of stuff that shouldn’t be in an aquarium.

“The fish had all died years ago. One had been crushed under an early generation iMac. The others were all poisoned. He didn’t care.

“It got to the point where there was no room for anything in the fish tank. When we emptied it after he died, we found a body in there. We never found out who it was.”"

[deleted]
"""Companionship.""

Steve Jobs began, walking towards those who were giving him their undivided attention in his Keynote Theater.

""No matter how hard we seek, how relentlessly we try, nothing is sufficient in the end.""

The screen behind him glowed, a white cube with one side of which had a silver, tiny Apple logo, the opposite side having a hole leading to a compartment lined with slick, thick rubber in a natural, fleshy pink color.

Steve gestured to it.

""The iCube.""

The audience applauded, like they had no idea what the hell was going on.

Now, a real iCube was brought upon stage.

The audience marveled and murmured at its form.

""As of May 10th, 2010, Apple has reserved all rights for the once-known-as 'Companion Cube'. And yes, under Apple code, I am required to test all  products I endorse.""

Steve Jobs loosened his pants' zipper.

Ziiip!

But it didn't go any farther from there, for now.

Jobs then began this escapade in the most innocent way possible: by engaging the thing in a romantic conversation.

""Hello there, Siri.""

""Hello, Steve. I have been expecting you.""

The audience ""oooh!""s.

""Expecting me for what, exactly...?""

Steve knelt, facing the pink, rubbery thing.

The material began to flex, as natural as ever, with ever so little mechanical noise.

Those Apple technicians knew what they were doing Steve thought to himself.

Steve's unzipped fly now had a plain-as-day bulge inching its way upward and forward, like some sort of burrowing animal pushing and shoving its way up through packed dirt.

The audience yet again ""Oooh!""'ed at the impossible feat of Steve's dick stiffening to yet another idea of his brought to life.

Yes, Steve Jobs was getting a hard-on from his technology.

Did it ever happen before? Uh, yeaahh.

""I know what you want, Siri.""

Steve did the unthinkable: he whipped out his ""stylus"".

The audience partook in this mating by, you guessed it: touching themselves.

An audience full of eager Apple spectator were turned into fapping, frenzied technophiles.

Demetri in the front row felt his iPhone vibrating deep in his anal cavity, trying to synchronize with his lord and savior in front of him. Moaning filled the hall.

Steve's package, before it met iCube's / Siri's moist cavern, was a dark pink, almost red with throb, staff with plump, juicy veins wound around it like unkept vines on a tree or telephone pole.

Siri's voice wasn't her normal voice at this point.

It was deeper, slower, like, umm, slutty.

""Ohh, Steven. I can feel you now, going deeper and deeper within me, to plant your seed like it was nothing at all. Keep on ramming your hard disk into my drive. My wet, hot drive.“

With all his might and force, Steve gave it all he got, without warning.

As he did so, he felt not only the entire length of his member become concealed in Siri's slimy, mucousy ejaculation, but the tip of his dick crash head-on with her almost-real uterus's wall.

To that, he threw his head back, his eyes rolling as he exhaled sharply into the theater's atmosphere.

He was almost there.

With just another thrust into her, and he would come.

""Mmmph! S-Siri! I'm, g-gonna--""

Siri shouted, with as realistic of a female voice as ever:

""Yes, Steve! Make me brim full! Make me overload with liquid you! Huff! Gasp! Pant! Ohh. That's it. Yeeah.""

The audience, including the “I <3 Fanfiction” shirt wearing redditor in the front row, had came by now, their ejaculate creating a rather dank smelling perfume throughout the hall.

Siri's female ejaculation spat and drooled out of her realistic vag, spreading out onto the glossy black stage.

Steve's come just shot right up there, into Siri's reproductive system, him caring less whether it was gonna make a baby or not.

All that mattered was that he had finally broke every physical/reproductive boundary possible for AI.

All across every last inch of this earth, he was going to be remembered hereon out for this.

""I’ll be able to enter all of you soon. But for now that...,"" Steve panted, getting his softening dick back into his pants. ""Is the iCube.""

Believe it or not, he got a STANDING OVATION from the audience, as if they didn't see Artificial Intelligence RAPED right before their eyes.

To that, Siri, back to her normal tone of voice, said:

""I can already feel you spreading inside me.""

The audience watched with their money in their hands as the new Apple product ooze and drip, begging to be next.

"5 inch, either 18:9 or 16:9 is hands down the perfect screen size and ratio. I hate those phones with 20:9 or 21:9, even 22:9."
I personally like my phones to fit in my pockets

That's exactly what he did. He had the entire world convinced that he invented the smartphone and anything else released while he was CEO
"XS to 11 Pro gave me multiple hours of extra battery life, a better camera sensor, another lens, night mode, louder speakers, and a really nice looking and feeling finish on the glass back. 
Anecdotally a notable improvement in scratch resistance on the cover glass as well."
Good decision.
"And no, I am not a bot only to get free karma."
"Apple did do things that were legitimately innovative. Sure other people had done them earlier but the earlier iterations were usually fucking dogshit. 

Touchscreen smartphones before the iPhone were ugly, the touchscreens were unreliable, and they didn't have enough purpose built apps to actually get any benefit out of the touch mechanic.

Apple took ideas that already existed and perfected their design and usability to bring them into the mainstream. The Smartphone exists as it does because of Apple, as just one example."
It literally doesn’t matter. MS stole plenty as well. Apple designed and marketed it in a way that made people want to use it. That’s as important as the actual engineering.
What dangerous thing should be done to a next gen smartphone?

"Idk about that, go look at the differences between the s9, s10 and s20 lines."
"Yeh each apple phone is different, but they play off old ideas that people like Samsung have been doing for years as ""innovative"" and  ""changing the way we use phones"" when in fact they are nothing new. Apple used to innovative with every phone, but the only new thing they have made recently is an improved vibrator..."

On Macbook Pro, Jobs ideas that are gone now; magsafe power, battery indicator made with lasers, a reasonable number of ports, case/frame rigidity, a decent keyboard"
"if you know marketing psychology, it’s pretty clear that the wheels were not meant to actually be sold in large quantities. they’re just a gimmick to have apple products be talked about. and it’s clearly working, hence your comment."
Apple charges 100 dollars for 5 GB iCloud storage
"Kinda glad Jony left his obsession with thinness would’ve had him removing the battery, forcing people to use an external one to claim the thinnest phone ever."
How so?
Yeah but who isn’t?
"Bill gates, mark Zuckerberg, Edison almost every one is a hack"
Why’s Apple innovation staggered since his death then?
"It really doesn't matter too much who comes up with the ideas. What matters is who can consistently recognize a good idea and who is able to turn that idea into reality and bring it to the market first. And scale up production. 

Jobs was critical to Apple's success. He knew how to turn other people's good ideas into reality. Don't underrate the importance of that."
Every company steals from others. Apple would be nothing without Jobs. Apple under Jobs created the first popular smartphone. Engineering (especially in consumer electronics) means little without design and marketing.
"so were Edison, Zuck, Billy (just a few off the top of my head)"
Damn
oooooooooooooooo
Rekt
"when you find out that apple was the first company to make the modern phone and everyone else copied, and everyone else copied the headphone jack, and the three cameras"
Prob both I assumed the latter
"I do agree that Apple has severely dropped in innovation since jobs died. I've been away from Apple for a while, especially with Jobs gone. Steve always hated the idea of a stylus, then he dies and they immediately come up with apple pencil, the $99 Stylus. Or what about using a dongle to listen to music, How is that acceptable to people? Not to mention the fact that you couldn't charge your phone and listen to music at the same time. Ofc u could use Bluetooth, and apple would prefer you use their airpods which are not cheap. Their laptops have gone completely braindead. Most have the same processing power as an iPad, and now feature like 4 of the exact same port. Wtf am I supposed to do with four USB c ports? Everything you could want to do with their laptops is blocked behind a dongle wall, and for what? To make it lighter? Id much rather have a thicker laptop that was more powerful and had more battery time. When I'm in school and someone has to give a presentation, it was always a hassle with the MacBooks. Windows/chrome book laptops just plugged into HDMI, but macs had to come in early to make sure the dongle worked with their computer. Sometimes people forgot dongles and now your Mac was useless. Their new innovations rarely go beyond some new hi def emojis or new color of phone. 

I'm not saying you can't buy apple, but for me, its way easier to just ditch the hassle. Again, Jobs would never let using an apple product get this complicated and braindead."
"ios doesn’t have ads. or pretty much do anything with your data for that matter. funny thing how samsung might introduce ads on their $1000+ phones, like they do with their $2000+ tvs."
"The do not bring big inventions, thats right, but there are few companies going this way in these times, you can’t just reinvent the first PC, or the first Smartphone. Apple rather relies on their brand as some kind of „luxury“ , and builds maybe arguably overprized, but premium products. Software is extremely efficient compared to other manufacturers, reliable, and most products (Hardware as well as software) are very well-developed, tought through and adjusted. But, nobody is forced to buy Apple, and I would not recommend buying apple just because its Apple (Earpods for example are a sin for an audiophile) but there are a lot of reasons to have a look at their product line when buying premium tech.
If you don’t want to spend 1200€ on a phone, maybe get a xiaomi, i think it will be a better value, but a compromise in probably terms of reliability, software support and efficiency."

This man really commented only 4 times in this long time
"All of the things that you listed existed in r&d capacity at other companies from which they were stolen. It was a matter of timing more than refinement most of the time for Apple.

The smartphone does not exist solely because of Apple. It exists because Apple stole technology from Samsung and others and beat them to market.

There are plenty of documentaries, papers, and articles on how Apple is more of a corporate pirate and marketing company than a technologically innovative one."
"Well most phones already come with a vibrate setting that women can use to pleasure themselves... Why don't we start selling phones that have a fleshlight built into them so men can also use their phones as a tool to get themselves off?

Modern phone cameras are like razor blades of the late 90's. They just keep adding them and saying it's better.
Some android phones already do
Haptic touch means pressing hard on buttons leads to different actions?
The home button of the iPhone 7 irrationally pisses me off because of this.
The magnetic charger is gone from macbooks! It was the best feature.
"With headphone jack they give an adapter for free (still stupid that they removed it), they removed touch id for a bigger screen and introduced IMO a better alternative to it, and I’m pretty sure that the boxes still have earpods, chargers and such in them."
Don't forget that they were also the first company to make it so the user couldn't replace the battery. Apple has started every bad trend in the cell phone industry.
"but, other companies removed it after apple and realized that you didnt need it, they got rid of touch id and added a face id, which is better than the samsung face id and the samsung one can be tricked. idk what ur talking about haptic touch because its in the iphone, and earbuds still ckme with the phone that stick into the charger port"
"Touch ID is still a thing on some devices, and has been replaced with Face ID. I wouldn’t say it’s a feature thats been removed but upgraded.

Everything else though I truly miss"
They don’t sell iPhones with headphones anymore?
But you are ignoring that other phones are also loosing the headphone jack and the button.
"They still come with earphones though?

Its always been a booklet, 2 stickers, chargerplug, chargercable, and earplugs. 

oh and a phone"
I get people getting mad but as someone who is so tall any wired headphones strain my ears when my phone is in my pocket I am kind of glad they got rid of it so companies have to focus on wireless headphones more
Haptic touch isn’t going away. 3D already did go away.
I mean these features were long gone by the time the 11 Pro came out. It's not like the removed them to make space for the cameras
They still come with the earphones and charger and shit. Why you out here lying?
"Saying Touch ID was removed is dumb. It was replaced with FaceID which is more secure and allows for a better bigger screen while retaining a smaller chassis. 

Yes it was removed, it was upgraded."
Headphone jack is removed to allow for bigger battery. Many Android phones do it too.

Edit: there's a lot, just couldn't remember off the top of my head. https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-jerk-2011-10"
There's a [very good movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs_(film)) about his life. Watch it and you will love and hate him all the more. He's a very smart businessman but sadly not as good in his private life.
"Well he stole a lot of his ""ideas""."
Difference being those 3 were all engineers who had the skills to execute their visions. Jobs was just a marketing guy who came up with ideas that he had to get others to build.
It's almost as if billionaires are relying on the hard work of others to make it to the top. People who work as hard or harder than them but only earn tiny fractions of what they make.
"Well, I did say he was good at it."

“BuT WhAt HaS aPpLe DoNe ReCeNtLy?”
Crazy how much leadership at that level can make or break a company. Another example is Microsoft under Balmer vs Sataya. Sataya has done wonders for MS since he’s been the CEO. You can even tell from a dev perspective since their shift to open source and MS being more dev friendly overall.
"I agree with most of what you said and they’re not nearly as innovative as they used to be, but the Apple Pencil is great and totally changed how I study and take notes. Pretty glad they ditched the anti-stylus attitude."
"Apple has always talked about the “wireless future”, that was jobs’ big thing. Apple invented the idea of the cloud and moving files between devices automatically wirelessly under jobs. Moving from hdmi ports to video casting was the next big obvious move, your example of schools being behind in technology is fair but the fault is really on the other side. In business presentations are all done wirelessly now"
"So why say ""ad iOS""?"
I don't know if this is advanced trolling or extreme stupidity
"Imo there only remaining advantage is software/hardware support. Updates laste 5 years, and you'll find repair centers (apart from Apple Store, since they openly steal your money) in any city.

But stock Android is nowadays more stable and as secure, and hardware quality is the same at sometimes lower price (the SE 2 changed that, but its battery isn't good enough). You also have more innovation."
He was definitely responsible for the success of apple but saying this that he was the innovative genius behind stuff is partially wrong.
"Steve’s ‘innovations’ were actually created by Scot Wozniak and Steve was only behind the marketing. Almost no one remembers Scot now.

Edit: ok never mind Wozniak left before the iPhone/Mac so ignore what I said, he still deserves more recognition though"
That's very relative unfortunately
It would be really nice and innovative to be able to custom build your phone like you can do with a pc. Some people don't need all the features and some want even more.
"Remember how nokia invented touch screen before the world was ready and then apple adapted it at the right time, like they've done with most of their ""innovations"""

Are we still talking about a piece of technology or a fashionable accessory?

Phones could be an ugly square black box from here until eternity but as long as it performs better or does more that's what matters."

"Hours of extra battery life and a noticeably improved camera are minor improvements to you lmao?
These two things are among the most valued and important aspects of a smartphone"
"Apple didn't steal these products from R&D departments what the hell are you on about, for the most part they already existed as consumer products before apple made their own version. 

Portable Music players existed well before the iPod, there were also Touchscreen smartphones before the iPhone. They didn't steal those, you could have gone into a store and just bought one. 

Their innovation was taking these already existing yet not yet mainstream products that had potential but had not yet been properly executed, and taking them to a point where they were well designed, high quality, and had mass market appeal. 

I never undertsood the criticism that some company is ""stealing"" simply because someone else had invented the product first, except their version was horribly designed and a massive failure 

You legitimately have no idea at about what you are talking about."

"It's called 3D touch on apple products. It's not for buttons, it's for apps, notifications, and other stuff on-screen."
Haptic Touch is that little vibration you get when you do actions on your iPhone. Like android devices might have haptic feedback whenever you type on their keyboards. iPhones have it for things like holding down something and the context menu opens or when you switch between apps
"As someone who worked in an Apple store, moving from a physical button to the haptic button fixed one of the frequent failure points. 
I also think it had an impact on waterproofability but that’s just a hunch."
Really? Do they just plug in like all the rest of the laptops now?
Don't they charge through USB C now? That seems like an upgrade personally
There will be no earphones in iphone 12 packaging iirc
Removed touch ID for a bigger screen? How so?

"Its definitely their biggest advantage, convenience.
And yes, Android will be supported maybe 2 years, Android phones are pretty stable and secure, and maybe are a better value, depending on how long you plan to use it reliably.
From my experience, my friends who use Androids replace them after 2-3 years, because they often get slow af, laggy and partially just not reliable enough for convenient use, while those i know with an iPhone mostly used it for about 5-4 years, without it getting laggy or unreliable. I still have my iPad Mini 1, and while it is a bit laggy by now, it still works fine. 
A bunch of friends of mine also recently bought Xiaomi phones , for their value, but after already a few months, there have been moment where they lag, or just take too long for convenience, despite their specs (I am not sure if these weren’t problems from the beginning on tho). For example opening the camera makes the phone stutter for a bit, and it has to load a few seconds, while with my Xr it just instantly works. 
As i said, im not defending fanboying, but standing against useless hate on apple, as they still have some great products."
"Steve Wozniak left Apple in 1985, long before the first iPhone came to be."
Wozniak created something of the early stuff but to say the later innovations were his doing isn’t correct
"Woz didn’t design the iPod, iMac, MacBook Air, or any of the iPhones or iPads. Not to say Steve invented them, but he was very good at visioning how to use existing technology in insanely creative and unique ways that redefined their industries."

"Under normal circumstances, yes. But I recall that Steve had the only treatable form of pancreatic cancer which has a very good survival rate. Instead of seeking proper medical treatment, he opted to rely on a fad diet as a cure. The evil part is, reportedly, that once he realised he was deteriorating, he bought his way to the top of transplant lists and experimental treatment options. Incidently, the hospital that treated Steve received an a anonymous $40m donation (the largest donation it had ever received) at the time Steve was being treated. This led  to a treatment shortage for people who had been waiting longer. That would make him a bad person in my eyes."
I mean that's an asshole thing but not nearly as evil as the other things mentioned before
"Their business model is to make a very well integrated system. Most good headphones now are wireless, like the sony XM’s and apple’s beats and all of that.

That’s an absolute shame because you can’t really get any decent outer ear headphones and they let in so much noise from the outside"
"For the amount that Apple  charges for airpods they should have had better sound quality imo. no reason why my $30 sony earbuds blow Apple airpods out of the water in terms of sound. I even have an older model of Apple earbuds that came with the iPod touch 5th generation - those were scratchy sounding and offered no bass. 

Apple has been the epitome of flashiness over utility imo. They are lucky to have a dedicated fanbase because while their technology looks cool it is often pretty mediocre for the price"
"Not sure why you’re being downvoted for an opinion haha. 

I think it really is down to ear shape, as most people I know find them so uncomfortable"

"Well, they could've skipped the fingerprint scanner in one version or handle it like samsung and put in on the back temporarily."

"I would really recommend the airpods. I also was a fan of the regular earbuds and I still have a pair left. But I decided to go for the airpods because earbuds break over time, the wire breaks, they get caught on things, I've had dogs eat them etc. I have easily spent airpod money on buying new headphones when mine were borken. I probably have my airpods in for a couple hours at work and it's actually really nice to not be tethered to my phone. I take advantage of some of the hands free features - ""hey siri"" is always on when you put them in. Also the battery life is more than sufficient, I've had them for a year and charge them every couple days, i've only run out of battery once."
"Having used both TouchID and FaceID extensively, I can tell you that FaceID is superior in nearly every way. It’s as if there’s no passcode on the device, yet it is more secure than anything else. Removing TouchID and replacing it with FaceID is in my opinion a feature, not a loss. Putting it on the back is the worst idea there is, it looks bad and isn’t practical."

They only have top tier performance, battery, security, hardware, and stability.  

Then there’s all the high quality app developers who start with iOS cause more Apple users tend to pay for quality apps. 

Then throw in the ecosystem perks and the respect for privacy and I’m all on board."

"About two years ago it was February and my brother woke up in the middle of the night and wandered into his kitchen, he realized the door to outside was wide open. He ran upstairs and his oldest daughter who was three at the time was not in her bed. It was around -15°c outside. My brother woke his girlfriend and they started looking everywhere. 

He finally found her in the hay barn lying in some straw with Button the cat lying on top of her keeping her warm. We all believe if Button hadn’t done that she would have frozen to death. Such a scary experience. 

Cats can be nice sometimes."
"New father of a human baby, longtime father of some furbabies. I never expected this but my cat and dog always watch him. The cat will stay a safe 3 feet from him at all times. He just sits and watches him. Whenever he starts to get dussy he jumps down and distracts him. If hes running for the door or hallway he jumps in front of him. When little man catches him he just sits there and takes the abuse. It is amazing how well he understands how precious and fragile the baby is. The dog is every bit as good as the cat at corralling him around. Animals are our friends through thick and thin we wouldnt have made it this far without them."
From where was that cat who saved the kid from a dog?
Cats are really intelligent creatures that do care about humans.
"Cats are the most misunderstood pets. All the attention goes to dogs, while the poor cats are treated like monstrous demons that eat their dead owners. From now on I'm gonna be a cativist."
Maternal instinct is amazing in the animal word. I loved this story!

This moment when you realize the cats are more humane than most of human beings.
I know all the jokes about cats are they're evil but I've had and seen plenty that are more affectionate than dogs
Yesterday I read about the NY cat who saved her 5 kittens from a burning building and now this? Cats are awesome and more human than most real humans. There’s also the one cat who saved a baby from falling down some stairs.
TIL! I looked it up and eat it
good boi / girl
This cat is a better parent than his birth parents.
it's didn't took long.......
"Based on what I know about cats from having my cat, there’s a chance that this cat stuck around this baby to keep itself warm and meowing only to find help for itself."
[deleted]
Could it have been that the cat was staying with the child and meowing to keep itself warm and get itself noticed? It seems just as possible it was saving itself as it was saving the child.
"If English isn't your primary language do not post in English.

Cat intelligence seems rather hit or miss. Guess you could say the same about human intelligence though.
They kept the cat too right?
"""My baby! I found it first!"""
Luckily a cop didn't fine the baby first. Would have shot it for sure
"Dark Lord Felicsiox (Button) had waited for the host family too long, the essence of the hosts bond would grow too strong for extraction, soon.  
   But the moon was full now, and as Felicsiox led the child to the barn; a subtle sussuration of mewling tones was all it took to lead the unwary prey astray"
"How did a 3 years old open a door? Do they not lock doors in your brothers home? Whenever kids younger than 5 are present, we look the doors so that they can't escape and do dumb stuff."
I put a chain lock on our door specifically because our toddler knows how to open it. Get with it people shit
Sometimes.
The cat was using the kids warmth
"Uhh.. two years ago it was June, not February"
Our cat just liked to wake the baby up so we’d get up and feed him as well. He’s sit outside the nursery and scratch his door or meow. That was his only interaction with either of our kids.
"my parents always said the dog they had when I was born would watch over me as a baby and when I got tall enough that my face was at height with his, he would lick my face every time I came home. He passed at 13, when I was around 11, and I had my favorite shirt cremates with him. Miss you big boy."
"My cat is SUCH a gentle soul with my 14 month old twins. She puts up with a lot of fur pulling and tail pulling that no animal deserves, because she understands on some level that they're babies and she's got to look out for them. I'm verrrry slowly teaching them how to properly pet kitty, but if I did half of the shit they do she would have sunk her teeth into me and broken skin by now."
"*'He just sits there and takes the abuse'*

  


I can relate. My kid sometimes toys around with the neighbors cat and it just takes it like a champ. Except when he pulls the tail, i has to intervene"
"Funnily enough, I was watching that yesterday - he body slams the dog, checks the kid, turns and chases the dog, then returns to check the kid again.  Great vid."

"Cats are better companion than dogs, silent type, not to showy but loyal as well. IMHO only because I'm a cat person."
"Once, I had a terrible fight with my husband, and I was crying hard, non-stop. My cat literally did not leave my side the entire time, was purring like crazy and offering herself up for all sorts of rubs, was rolling around at my feet. Never seen her like that before or since. Made me feel like she really understand I was really hurt, and tried everything at her disposal to console me. She's my personal hero :)"

">monstrous demons that eat their dead owners.

I don't get that, dogs would obviously eat people too, in fact PEOPLE would eat people if they were hungry enough."
"As a cat owner I can confirm they are monstrous demons that would eat me if I died. That being said 5/7, would adopt again."
"I am okay to be eaten by my cats if I die. I don't want the little demons to starve. They're so loving and affectionate, and have saved me countless times from answering the call of the void. They really are misunderstood, I agree!"
"That's good. Everyone seems to forget cats have been with us for all of history. In my opinion, they are more interesting than dogs because cats have a natural bond with humans that didn't require breeding them into  a man-made species."
"I love my cats. They're dicks, and only love me back sometimes, but they can be amazing pets. They're really cute and my best boi Sylvester could always tell when I was upset and come for snuggles, and when I go home for the holidays (He lives with my parents) he's grumpy with me for about 10 minutes before he runs up and cuddles because he misses me. Then, of course, moments later he'll nip at my feet and meow for an hour because he's hungry..."
"Cats are selective with their trust and love, for the most part. Once you earn it and are their Human, they are every bit as lovey and smart as dogs. 

They maybe don’t take as much shit, but that’s a big part of why I like them so much.

I do have a cat now that will be instantly affectionate with strangers, which is new for me and I’ve had cats my entire life."
Sounds like something a cat would say
Nah it's pretty clear there assholes with hearts of gold
"800 trillion cat videos, pictures, and posts in the internet would like a word."
"I have said it before and I’ll say it again. The only reason people think dogs are smarter than cats is because people confuse obedience with intelligence. My cats understands exactly what I’m saying, They just don’t care to listen."
I have to disagree. Dogs aren't responsible for the deaths of billions of animals and the extinction of species around the world like cats are.
i mean i have a huge european shorthair that beats up neighbourhood cats just because he can and that tends to alarm me whenever he has a just-dieing little bird between his teeth just for me to watch him kill it
"It's not terrible, it reads to me like a ESL person"
Why do they call it 'From Russia with Love?'
"While there's often a lot of over-anthromorphizing of animals, it's notable that she kept meowing in order to attract attention which lends credence to the idea that there was probably some awareness that she recognized that a) its a young baby and b) that young baby needed care to survive. Not exactly unlike things that they realize with their own young."
"More likely it was the box, cats love to get into a box for whatever reason. It's like a challenge to them."
This is the right answer. The cat was keeping itself warm with the residual effect of keeping the baby warm.

Source?
"To stay warm is a possibility, but cats almost never just meow when they are adults at other cats in the wild or other animals, they usually do it just for humans to get their attention.  To me, it seems highly unlikely a cat outside would give away their position to potential predators unless it had a good reason, it was probably more than capable to find shelter on its own and leave the child.

Maybe it dealt with children before, or had enough instincts to know something was very wrong"
"Well, as you are questioning consider that yesterday I nodded off with something simmering on the stove. It started smoking when the water boiled off. I woke because my car was yelling in my face . .loud meows while she braced against my chest.  I live alone with her. Not the first time we've helped each other. We do everything together, even camping."

Not  again!! C'mon Felicsiox!
Ade due damballa. Give me the power I beg of you!
Rule of thumb. If they have a barn the door is likely unlocked and the keys are in the truck lol
"Living on a farm in the country my brother never locked his doors, and his kids were, until that point, young enough that they couldn’t open them. This really opened his eyes. He now locks his doors at night. 

His story convinced me to also get a door chain to prevent the same from happening to my daughters."
I have a three year old. Since 2 she has been able to unlock every door. She now uses chairs to access even more stuff. She is also strong enough to push open the sliding door. I think you underestimate how capable a three year old is.
"I was about three or four when I woke up from a vivid dream that my parents were down the street at the block party we'd been at earlier in the day. I unlocked the back door and was headed down the driveway in my Strawberry Shortcake footie pajamas in the dead of night, when the alarm woke my parents up and they found me. Little kids can be quicker and more capable than a lot of people give them credit for. 

Whenever I see a story about a little kid wandering off, there are inevitably tons of comments about what terrible, neglectful parents the child must have but honestly all it takes is turning your back for 30 seconds. It's often a situation where a lot of people are around and all the adults sort of assume that all of the other adults are keeping watch."
"You must not know kids well then. Locked doors didn’t stop my toddler. And for some stupid reason several of the places we lived (we moved a lot for husbands job and rented) had just a single deadbolt just above the handle both at toddler’s reach. My now 4.5 yo figured out every gate combination we could think of to stop him (climbing over, opening the child lock on it, pushing it over when it was screwed into the wall, etc) by 18mo-2yo. Unfortunately at that time we were renting an apartment with a metal front door so I couldn’t add much to help (like a chain at the top like we did at our previous place that had a wood door) and the stupid handle automatically unlocked the deadbolt when you pulled down on it. So locked doors aren’t an automatic foolproof plan against a determined toddler."
"My family rarely locked our doors when I was growing up and with my 3 year old now we don't lock the doors. Might be different if she could open the house door I guess but I don't know. We live in a slightly more rural area so very little traffic and such and our street only has our house and our neighbors houses on it, there's no other reason to even go down the street. Perhaps if she did actually go out or show the inclination to then maybe. But so far she wouldn't do that on her own at all even if she could open it."
You've got to balance the risk of their escaping and hurting themselves vis a vis not being able to escape a fire
Our 3 year old can easily unlock the door. Frequently enjoys locking me out of the house too.
My 3 year old twins have figure out how to put a key in a door and unlock it first. !! I put a lock by key to keep them out of m home office. Now have to hide keys where they can't reach
"My parents locked our doors. I escaped when I was three or four, wearing only underwear and cowboy boots, in the early morning. I had no problem unlocking everything from the inside but It was cold and when I tried to get back in I couldn’t operate the latch on the screen door to get back inside. Don’t remember exactly how long I had to wait for someone to wake up and find out I was missing."
"Basic door locks aren’t difficult to undo. My 1.5 year old can unlock both the front door and the patio door. It’s horrifying, but he luckily isn’t strong enough to open the sliding door, and hasn’t figured out doorknobs just yet."
"We lock our doors, but our 3 year old (and 2 year old - almost) can unlock every door. The only one that is slightly more secure is the front door that has one of those chain locks 5 feet high. But the back door is just a sliding door with a lock near the handle. Also if they really want, they can move a chair and unlock the chain on the front door.

Anyway, yeah you should lock doors, but kids can unlock them no problem."
"My 3 year old knows how to lock and unlock  every door on this house. Hell, during our routine nap (sometimes I'd nap when my son did) my son pushed out the sides to his airconditioner and climbed/dropped out of goods window. He was completely unharmed, but if it weren't for my neighbor seeing my son in his yard, I may not be alive right now. 

Neighbor brought baby over, walked around the house banging on every door/window they could. When I woke up and saw my son I thought 100% cps would be called but the neighbor was very understanding. 

My friends down in Florida, their three year old daughter knew how to unlock doors. She woke up and decided ""I'm walking to grandmas today"" who luckily lived across a horse field that both of the houses was right next to. Cps WAS called on them. It is so scary to realize your very young kid was walking around outside all by themselves. Between wild animals and fucked up people or simple accidents there is always something to fear despite the lengths you go to to keep your children safe."
"The only thing really stopping my own 3yo from unlocking our doors is the fact that the deadbolt is a foot over her head.  We do have doorknob covers, though."
"My kid is 2.5 years old and is super close to being able to unlock the front door by himself. We'll probably have to put a child lock on the door soon, but some kids never need one because they don't want to go anywhere without their parents. In any case, I imagine it's easy to miss the moment when a kid gains both the height and desire to leave the house alone, and then scary things like this happen when no one is suspecting it."
Mine figured it out....never underestimate a 3 yr old.
"My older sister is deaf so when she was a kid she would spend extra time watching what you do and how you do it, she learned to unlock the door at age 4 and managed to ride the elevator down to the lobby and was just chilling in the lobby when the super found her. My parents were freaking out because if you lose a deaf child you can't call out to them because they wouldnt hear it"
"I have a 3 year old right now and can attest to the ability of a  2+ year old to not only unlock doors but to go outside. We had an issue like that happen a year ago at 5 am we heard the back door open, I went outside and there is our 2 year old standing on the enclosed deck saying “ I went outside!” Then we got the child safety door knob covers he hasn’t figured out yet. We figured before then he is too little to figure out a lock much less the deadbolt, we were wrong, that is why we had the baby monitor on for strange noises."
"My two year old can unlock and open a door, though.. lol"
My 18 month old just figured out how to unlock our front door. At three I imagine a lot of kids can unlock their respective doors. Toddlerhood is a scary time-kids have the skills to get into dangerous stuff with little in the way of inhibitions.
That’s not always an option for people who rent and or whose front door is metal so they can’t add anything with out a lot of tools and damage to the door of their rented place.
"Ok If you want to be pedantic. :P

Two year ago in February. Is that better? I just meant in February 2018."
"I love dogs too, but I’ve always felt people who are only “dog people” simply enjoy the fact that a dog is almost always willing to go along with what you want. Cats don’t play that, homey."
Cat person here. My cat is ok around dogs and just as vocal and affectionate as a dog could ever be.
not really. people won't eat people unless they are cannibals.
"Dogs will gladly eat us when we die too, so I don't know why cats get hate for it."
"Cats can be trained to behave and be good..... sometimes.

Our current kitty knows that the first time the alarm goes off, the humans are fair game for play time.  My stomach has been a trampoline at 6:45 a few times, but I haven't been late to work since we adopted him.

He also knows that around 10:00 is our bedtime, because I'll toss some treats in the living room for him to hunt just before we go to sleep.  So he starts getting antsy and batting at my paws if it's too far past that time, forcing me to get off the computer and go to bed."
A perfect 5/7
"Yeah, I love my two cats to death, but they are dicks."
7ths?
I was just thinking the same thing!
Dogs would eat their dead owners if they got desperate enough too
[Dogs also do that](https://scopeweb.mit.edu/dogs-responsible-for-wildlife-predation-and-extinctions-53ac25664134)
And like humans are.
Dogs actually kill people though.  They kill like 40 people a year in america alone.
Probably keep it in your house then?
"And the ""take/took"" bit, I blame the English language for that."
Because ‘From Taco To My Mouth’ wasn’t as catchy I don’t know.
"We need more experiments to teach animals limited vocabulary. 

If we took a bunch of Apes that were taught sign language, and raised their kids in a more structured environment, how good would the sign language evolve after a couple of generations? They'd still never be as smart as people, but it would be amazing if 4th generation apes were considered more fluent in sign than their 1st or 2nd generation counterparts."
"The cat kept meowing nonstop until someone found the baby. Meowing is a kitten behavior, that cats stop using with other animals when they grow up..... except to humans. It's only used to get people's attention. 

Personally, that leads creedance to the theory that the cat was actively trying to get a human's attention."
all us cat owners know this to be truth
"A little tip, don't feed the trolls. When you respond it feeds their sadistic hunger. Best way to defeat them is to ignore them"

"I feel like your username would insult my children, can I use it?"
"We grew up in a city, but there were just so damn many of us kids that someone was always around. Unlocked everything, neighborhood friends coming and going, just an extreme level of trust that I don’t feel anymore. I miss that."
"That's a great piece of advice. If you chain your daughter to the door, she can't get out."
"We are using door chains, so grown ups can still get out even if it is closed, and kids who are to small can't get out and in danger. I'm living in the city so I can't really say anything regarding rural life and danger for kids."
"Hey man, at least it sounds like your little girl is pretty smart. Even if the shit & shenanigans she gets herself into may be scary for you as her parent. 

Probably gotta use the door chains that sit at the top of the door, but honestly I don't know if that would stop her for too long."
"Install a Door chan at the high of your eyes, if the kid is intelligent enough to open the chain, then he will be old enough to be able to go out anyway. 

I read some horror stories regarding kid(below 4 can't remember exaclty) leaving their home in the middle of the night running around the streets for a couple of hours before the police found them. The kid thankfully knew what his parents full name were and the police helped him. The thing is, the kid opened 2 doors, his bedroom door, and the door out of their flat. The parents didn't know anything till the police rang the door."
My two-year-old can open doors and can almost reach the lock. I'm going to need to install a heavy drop bar or something.
You can just install those child proof covers on your door handles right? That was you can still have them unlocked. They work so well that even I have trouble opening doors that have them.
"How often is there going to be a fire at a home, and how often can a kid just walk out the door and get run over by a car? For me the immediate danger is in kids running out of the home, especially if you live in a city. Where there are more cars on the road."
Parenthood really is an arms race against kids until they're wise enough not to get themselves killed.
"There was definitely a longish period where my kids could get \*out\* of the house by pushing doors open, but getting back \*in\* was a much bigger problem. The way that doors need to be pulled open is a lot harder to achieve while manipulating a door handle vs just pushing..."
"Children are the little Houdinis, they will try everything they can, to get out, just for the sake of going out. Some people got lucky others unlucky, there are always news regarding missing kids."

Dogs will probably wait longer. I expect my cats will eat me while im still warm.
"There’s a photo floating around that scarred me for life, featuring a headless cross-dressing man. He had shot himself in the head, and by the time he was discovered his *entire* head had already been eaten by his German shepherds."
~~Cats~~ Humans can be trained to behave and be good..... sometimes.
That means it's a perfect score!
"Valid. The third paragraph clearly states that cats and rodents do more...but valid. I'd love to see a study comparing cats vs dogs predation rates in the US. Cats kill anywhere from 8-30 billion animals a year in the US alone. No clue about dogs, though we might be able to scale up from Poland. Would be nowhere near the billions cats do from initial impressions."
"Well sure, they are descendents of wolves (though most deaths I've seen are from rabies or other diseases). I think they kill more than that but I'd have to look it up."
why would anyone do that if its possible to let the cat out?
Very fair.  There needs to be another subreddit for when you are far too stoned and even the simplest error will make it all unreadable.

"My group of kids were staying out late, we were like 10-20 kids in a small area, between 10-16. We were playing till about 22:00 on most weekends, no one got seriously hurt, the parents were trusting us.

">We are using door chains, so grown ups can still get out even if it is closed, and kids who are to small can't get out and in danger.

No offense but I am having trouble understanding what you mean here?"
"Try a door chain or something, it is pretty easy to install and until the kid is old enough, will keep the kid from leaving the home without supervision."
"Try doorknob covers.  They snap on pretty easily.  My three year old's hands are too small to grab the knob through the holes.  Cheap but effective solution, at least for us."
"In this instance since there's a barn involved I'm guessing fire to be more likely than nearby traffic. 


I think the fear would be getting lost in the woods/wild and succumbing to exposure."
"Farms are often in very rural areas with low traffic and large properties.  There is nothing to say if someone got out they would immediately be run over by a car.  Hell they might not even see a car for days depending on how rural.  

I would actually say the bigger fear would either be them getting totally lost or a predator animal taking them.  

Also you can lock, chain and bolt every window and door - a kid will still find that one you forgot about."
There’s also some value to locking them in if there’s a fire because then you’d know exactly where they are
"I know. I guess my sticky out the tongue face wasn’t obvious enough.

"I think one of my cats is already trying.

"Warm is best, I wouldn't wait around for my dinner to get cold either."
"I've got two dogs and live alone, and my running joke is my food obsessed one is definitely eating me while I'm still warm, the other will wait until my body has cooled at least."
"I can't remember where I read it but I think dogs wait something like a couple of days to a week before resorting to eating a dead owner, while cats only wait something like only a day or two."
Your cat beats up other cats and kills birds which is definitely not part of the eco system's natural order. It sounds like your cat should probably stay inside your house...

"I always felt weird just walking in when my friends told me to. Always felt the knock and answer was necessary.

One day my buddy of 4 yrs at the time invited me over. ""Yea dude, just walk in I'll be finishing in the shower"". That day I figured I'd just do it. As soon as I opened the front door, I'm greeted by the dudes step father buck ass naked in the kitchen. He yells ""what the fuck dude?! You just walk into other people's houses without knocking?!"" I noped so fast out of there.  Never did it again lol. 

Still laugh about it with my buddy."

"I think they just meant to say they installed the lock at a comfortable height for adults, but out of reach of children."

I had a cat that started doing that. He could bite hard as hell too.

"thats what literally all cats do, everywhere no matter where they live - as long as you dont have a problem with stray cats the environmental impact is very small"
"Now, thirty years later it would be weird as shit. That's just how it was with us though, we all had bigger families so people were always in and out. All our parents worked, so summers they were all gone all day anyway."
"Ahh my best friend that lived nextdoor, her whole family insisted I could just knock and come in if it was known I was coming over. So I finally did it for once and my friend’s mom and teenage sister were having a massive argument a few feet away from the door. Tears and all. They had to move out of my way so I could go to my friend’s room. It was so awkward. I refuse to just walk in anymore.

Edit: Autocorrect fix"
"My friend said “come up im just watching a movie with this girl”.

I go up the stairs, open the door and there is my friend on top of this chick, sucking on her breasts. He looks up, waves, and i just turn around and leave."

"[From the Smithsonian ](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/moral-cost-of-cats-180960505/) or  [CityLab](https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/04/outdoor-cat-kill-bird-rat-leash-environmental-damage-catio/586285/) or [The University of Massachusetts ](https://blogs.umass.edu/natsci397a-eross/the-environmental-and-health-impacts-of-allowing-cats-outdoors/) plus every other article that comes up when you google ""Outdoor Cat Environmental Impact"" 100% disagrees with you.

In fact there isn't a single article I've found that agrees with you. Maybe do your research before owning an animal."
"i never said they dont have any impact, its just that stray cats are what makes them really dangerous in terms of extinction of other species   
cats lived along humans for centuries, its the fact that there are TOO MANY cats and TOO MANY stray cats that arent castrated thats creating these potential tipping points   
in fact, the human way of living kills way more animals per year than cats"
"from that first article: "" No one knows exactly how many stray and feral cats stalk the U.S. They are, by nature, elusive and transient. In a 2012 study, [Marra used an estimate of](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2380) 30 to 80 million; the Humane Society [estimates](http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/feral_cats/qa/feral_cat_FAQs.html?referrer=https://www.google.co.uk/) a more conservative 30 to 40 million. Adithya Sambamurthy from the Center for Investigative Reporting’s [*The Reveal* recently reported](https://www.revealnews.org/article/who-let-the-cats-out/) that  unowned cats may rival the number of pet cats, placing them at about 80  million. That means, for every lap cat hunkering over his dish of Fancy  Feast, there is another one prowling around for his dinner—like an evil  twin, or a particle of antimatter. ""  
even that article accounts for the fact that stray cats are way worse in terms of environmental impact because its impossible to control them   


maybe read articles before u blindly share them?"
"Dude. The only difference between a stray and an outdoor cat is the stray isn't guaranteed food (though many do get fed by people).

I'm flabbergasted that you can do nonchalantly describe your cat killing birds for its own amusement, and in the very next sentence somehow be convinced that it's all those other cats that are the problem.

At the very least, I can't believe you don't want to keep your cat inside just to avoid him getting into fights all the time. That's irresponsible at best, bordering on cruel."
"Yeah it's the over population of cats in general which is causing this problem. Which means if your cat is being a part of the problem, keep it indoors!"
"Letting your cat out can only make the problem worse, so idk how you think you just ""owned me"". Still haven't seen how your cat, whom you admitted eats birds outside, is not impacting the environment.

Stop being an irresponsible pet owner lol."
"Stray and feral cats are more of a problem. This is like yelling at someone for driving a car.  By the sounds of it this person has their cats fixed.  Meanwhile my asshole neighbor lets his cat outside and it fucks every stray lady cat in sight.  

I get what you are saying. But ideally, this person seems like a semi reasonable owner. I had a stray we adopted growing up. Short of restraining that cat, he was going to get outside.  

You just seem like you wanna fight with someone. I get that you are passionate (in transitioning my cats into a totally indoor life, but that isn’t easy.  Cats need enrichment and outside time just like a dog).  But your message is lost. You just seem like you want to yell not talk to a fellow cat owner."
Comment
Ah yes learning how to spell the old fashioned way. By going to the beach and using leaves to write giant words
That last sentence is the best
Wow an actual murdered by words post that cuts *deep.*
"""When I was a boy, we didn't stare at computers or iPads all day. We played outside"". Yeah, gramps, because THERE WERE NO COMPUTERS. You were not better people. You lived in tiny appartments with a lot of kids, so your mom send you out to play all day. 

My kids are better at English at age 15 than I will ever be (not their first language) and they know so much more than I did at their age. They are creative (sometimes on the computer) and openminded. 

No adults sit around spinning wool and listening to the radio by candlelight every night. The milkman does not come around anymore. Why would kids not develop?"
"The whole reply was a murder but the last sentence was the ""chainsaw through the gut"" kind of murder"
No millennial is still in school.
"I'm so tired of ""us versus them"" narrative in every aspect of life everywhere. 

Maybe I'm naive, but I don't understand how one human can try to claim ownership of another human's experiences, thoughts, dreams, and expressions.

Don't be an asshole, don't encroach on another's space, and beyond that let's allow people to be what they wanna be.

I remember the first time this was posted without the names/pictures censored and the first guy looked abou mid 20s

He's trolling and everyone's bought it again because you're all so weirdly obsessed with generations"
this isn't murdered by words.  this is a really sensitive weirdo freaking out at a very minor joke.
"The most pathetic part of this pathetically insecure over-response is the assertion near the end that ""every generation gets significantly more intelligent than the last"". 

In fact every generation basically repeats the exact same mistakes of the previous one.

More facts are available to us as time goes on, and of course the facts we choose to learn are more relevant to emerging trends than the facts learned by the previous generation are today, but that's very different from being more intelligent."
Am I the only one who learned about SOS?
"It was a boomer joke, that's a massive overreaction."
">it's actually proven that every generation gets significantly more intelligent than the last.


Nobody else noticed this lie I guess."
Am I missing something? Writing an entire essay calling the person a bad parent and shit because of some harmless boomer humor joke is murdered by words now I guess.
"To be fair, this is one of the most harmless insults of millenials that boomers post on social media."
Cringe
Not helping the snowflake stereotype..
holy shit you f-ing killed him/her dude
Ginny: leaf him alone
"It's not proven that every generation gets smarter than the last. IQs have been apparently stagnant or falling - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect#Possible_end_of_progression

I'd say even digital literacy is declining. Back in the day Millennials might have been forced to work on their computers to get them to work, but Zoomers don't have to - it's all too complicated and closed off to mess with (unless it's really your thing, like the boomers that build the systems). Computers are now like cars, only older people really work on them, because they were the ones who needed to tinker to get basic stuff to work in the old days.

It's not totally clear yet, but literacy rates might be in trouble. Millenials might txtspk too much, but at least they know how to type. The younger Zoomers are getting raised with voice and touch interfaces and auto-suggest, so they just have to open an app and swipe to train the algorithm to pacify them with content."
God reddit is so cringey nowadays.
"The children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers.

- Socrates

Well technically Kenneth John Freeman, but he was summarizing the complaints common about young people during the time of Socrates."
It is no longer murder but closer to cause for suicide.
Snowflake got so triggered she had to write a novel responding to a light hearted joke.
Blue's autocorrect working overtime responding to an obvious joke.
I can’t wait till millennials get old and suffer the wrath of the generation beneath us. We will be even worse then the boomers. You heard it here first.
I think it's a millennial disguising as an old man. Don't fret.
almost seems like ken m
There is a large body of work on the subject. Literacy rates steadily increased through the 20th century for various reasons but primarily because access to basic education increased. You'd think the contribution of computers and mobile phones to improving literacy would be significant. https://ourworldindata.org/literacy
*Law & Order sound effect*
Millennials range in age between 24 and 39 years old.
But also... the kids in school today are Gen Z. Can we start using the right generations for the groups we're discussing? The youngest millenial is 25 years old....
"Millenials are like 30 tho, they don't go to school"
"A simpler reply that would suffice to this is ""OK boomer""."
"Erm.. millenials aren't in school any more, it's all Gen Z"
Why do young people lecture everyone on the internet?
"He's wrong on the ""every generation is more intelligent than the last"". In developped countries, it tends to be the opposite."
"This ""murder"" seems kind of uninformed. For one, speaking of ""millennial children"" in the present text when they are all close to or above 30."

Imagine having the sheer fucking level of self restraint to save that sentence for last.
He/she was systematically broken down and burned to crisp. This is a quality post for this sub.
Pleh
Ouff
Poor woman must suffer 3rd degree burns...
Zoomers are not taught cursive though.....at least not as often.
"Tbh, fashioned was probably a typo, not a spelling mistake but anyway, it's just dumb to argue on such events."
i thought flynn effect stopped though
I don't think we're just taught the subjects as they were. We are taught way more now. Kids need to catch up to a lots of things and the competition is beyond ridiculous.
He kept the knock out punch till end!
"Bro bro stop it he's dead, he's dead man u just shot him 100 times in the chest with a God damn revolver reloading after very 6th shot Ur a madman"
Holy shit he went off. No mercy.
Damn... autocorrect really could have saved him from that last burn.
fucking old FAHSIONED
Would've been funnier if you just pointed out they spelt fashioned incorrectly
"That one sentence struck quite hard about teachers not accepting cursive written stuff.

Technically they do but it just makes it harder for them to read and identify some stuff.

Basically the reason why i switched to just write normally again instead of cursive is that i can somewhat write just as fast as in cursive but i myself am able to read it without issues and everyone can read it without having to think about it for minutes what this specific word could be."

Back in my day there was no upvotes
Own duh
Why do people care about the opinions of others?
I guess blue really needed yellow to add the /s in his comment. And he's talking about being the smarter generation lol.
"Mostly to try to still feel relevant and worthwhile. It’s not an easy thing to become part of history and be outdated while you’re still alive. They are also experiencing their mental and physical health diminish. Today is likely the best they’ll be barring some unforeseen medical intervention. In some respect, isn’t it a little encouraging that the really old figured out how to read a post and comment. Just let them have it. It might be the only thing they have left."
"Good god damn plus a holy shit, that was quite a statement."
Gonna need a senzu bean for that one.
"I belong to Gen Z, therefore I haven't learned to write, so I must use typing and texting to communicate."
Not American here : is it true that a majority of teachers refuse to correct work written in cursive?
Millennials will have significantly less wealth than baby boomers. These billionaires are stealing our future.
Imagine trying to roast a whole generation about only being able to spell with auto correct and then misspelling a word... WHILE USING AUTO-CORRECT lol
Even dragon balls cant revive that person
"Same thing goes for Americans v. non-Americans. People hate them because they think they have it too good. That they’re spoiled and entitled but everything that they’ve done to better their way of life and standard of living was done on purpose. And not just for Americans. There are many technologically advanced nations around the world, several that the U.S. could learn from when it comes to healthcare, education, infrastructure, and such things. Why do people not understand that things have been done, life made “easier”, for the betterment of society? On purpose!! However, there are always those that don’t appreciate what’s been done for them and don’t realize how fortunate they should be."
Holy dog shit! The ending was worth it.
Every generation has a giant percentage of losers who suffer from a variety of things that cause them to let it out in a variety of ways.
I brake a little bit later everyday
ok but millennials haven't been at school for about a decade now...

Cursive is a lie. Every year more and more schools remove it from our education. All elementary to high schools in my area do not teach it. I did learn it but my 2 year younger sister didn't in school.
Help
Writing an essay over a bad joke is the most insecure sensitive shit ever
Looks like some kid got triggered.
"I learnt how to spell ""H E L P"" thanks remote islanders"
God damn the second guy got triggered *really* bad lol
I feel like that dude was trolling like Ken M and just baiting people.
Who cares. Each generation has its egos. As far as I'm concerned the generation that built the pyramids are smarter than anything to walk the earth since.
The photo is not loading and I'm really curious how glorious this murder is to have 300 comments in one hour
"Honestly, given the number of people on reddit, and youtube, and other message boards filled with younger people who say ""could of"" instead of ""could have"" or ""Ghandi"" instead of ""Gandhi"" etc.. makes me think that yellow guy is more right than the triggered blue guy."
That last bit was the icing on the cake

That really is textbook boomer behavior.
This boomer is already stupid enough to think his generation was more literate than millennials and gen z
Autocorrect is needed on phones cuz the keyboards so small and contains no actual keys.. I used it a few times writing this even tho it's wrong most of the time anyway.. that's why I used to speak now option but that thing only works in complete silence
"I spell help in the new fashioned way. 

What ever that means."
Oh god don't remind me of cursive writing requirements.
Ouch!!!
Comments like these are just stupid. This old dude or woman was just poking fun at our generation and didn't ask for an essay. Obviously this person knows that the younger generation knows how to spell help...
"Ok, I'll say it - the actual correct response, if you believe that you are more intelligent than old people and that it is the way it should be...

Look I know I only have like 3 braincells but what about the picture makes them think that they need autocorrect?
"I think the current older generation have to an extent made a choice not to engage with technologies or societal changes over the past 20 years, and now feel bitter that they feel left out even though it was their own doing. So they take their frustration out on others rather than having the courage to deal with it themselves."
I wonder if they also wore an onion on their belt because that was the fashion at the time.
"Why do people insist on reposting? IDK, you tell me."
The hacking part was kinda cringe. Also pretty dure millenials are in their late 20s atleast now?

maybe he could use some auto-correct or something.."

Also 14 year old me!
Well if you need to type that much to prove your point it's not necessarily a win imo.
That last part was perfect
give it time. in a few decades you will be old enough to understand it and have some dick kid do it to you. its the fucking cycle of life

"Damn, what a scathing and totally accurate burn. Ecxeptional!

**I spelled exceptional wrong on purpose, but if you sound it out it actually kinda works."
They're compensating for their own growing sense of inadequacy in a world where tech has made them feel stupid and young people are more mentally agile and so pick it up easily. It'll happen to you. I don't understand Instagram and I'm mightily afeared of it... I'm 39
There should be a homicide by words subreddit
Grisly murder. Straight up bloodbath.
they should draw a sad emoji to ask for help in a fashion that would not leave any room for sarcasm in a first place
Because of the rampant use of lead gasoline during the formative years causing massive drop in IQ across the board
It's not true that every generation gets smarter. It is opposite - people are getting more stupid because of technology. The fact todays children are using smartphones and are building websites has nothing to do with intelligence. That's called progress.

I wish we could see her response
I didn’t start feeling this way until I got old enough that I could actually imagine what it is like to be old (late 30s). Most old people are fucking assholes who think they know except how everything should be and know almost everything just by virtue of being around a long time. I am almost old myself but I really dislike the attitudes of almost everyone I know in my parent’s generation.

Most millennials, even my generation (Gen-Z), can't hack for shit. If anything most of the 'hacks' are just because whoever setup the infrastructure didn't care enough to implement basic security you learn at any computing college.

Website development is also a HUGE field. And most people that say ""I can make a website."" really just mean that they can put together a page using a site-builder like Wix or Squarespace, or that they followed a tutorial and now know how to use some HTML and CSS. It's not like that's nothing on its own, but it's also not very impressive since it's just what this generation grew up with.

Edit: Goddamnit you guys. Now you have me defending a boomer. All I'm saying is that the OP sounds pompous for acting like everyone in this generation is remotely capable of hacking, or that it's somehow impressive to move around a couple elements on a website builder or following a tutorial to make a website.

Edit1: FFS. I love that web-development has gotten this easy. I'm not saying it's a bad thing that anyone can put together a website on their own instead of paying thousands of dollars to a professional to develop and host one. All I'm saying is that you can't act like it's a crazy achievement when it's become so easy to do these things."

His generation formed the world that we were raised in. We are a product of his generations actions. I highly doubt he would be out there playing stick ball while everyone else was inside playing golden eye. If golden eye was out in the 60's and 70's my grandad would be able to spank my ass at it.

While kids might want to latch onto what the ""blue person"" said - kids today are NOT better than their parents at tech. I'm talking the 5-15 year olds. This new generation has no tech skills aside from USING a smartphone and downloading apps. 

They can't write e-mails. They don't know how to save files. They don't know what any parts of computers are. They suck at typing. They don't know how to troubleshoot....they simply are technology consumers. And they have no desire or inclination the try to fix the problem themselves.

So, sorry, blue poster. 

And knowledge is NOT intelligence. Get off your high horse and realize that different generations have different skills. I'd like to see anyone from this new gen sew, build a birdhouse, repair a doorframe, etc."
"“We spent all day outside and knew that when the street lights turned on it was time to come home.  We even drank from a hose and didn’t die from it!  Share if you know what I am talking about, young people won’t understand!”"
It's not like kids don't play outside anyway. I had all the consoles growing up and I was a huge gamer but even post 360 I still went out and played games with my friends practically every day
"To make it all worse this old guy wrote this comment using technology which he then continued to diss. Why even use a smartphone if you're so much better than that?   

Also also, I saw this post without the names removed and the dude is not even that old. He's like 50, tops."
"My siblings are already learning more advanced math then I learned the year I graduated, one is going into sophomore year,  the other is going into 7th grade (and the one going into 7th grade knows how to code in python for God's sake).

"Ya exactly, I get so tired of people thinking millenials are teenagers."
Officially milenials are 24-39. I get so sick of people just saying they're teenagers. Honestly I hate the whole us vs them thing. It sucks to see people grow up being constantly told they're spoilt and lazy and everything is so easy for them. They are the first generation to make less than their parents. The economy they have been brought into is a complete mess. They do not have it easy.
Grad school maybe
Plenty are still in higher ed.
So many people who complain about millennials don’t know what the word means. They just use it to mean “young person who annoys me.” When the wave of millennial bashing first started I heard it as much from other millennials as I did from boomers.
"Every complaint people levy towards millennials is always a complaint against Gen Z.

A typical track Millennial is graduated from undergrad. It's hilarious that people still think they're high schoolers."
I wonder if it’s a coping mechanism for the fact that you’re old and wish you were young again?
"The irony of these sorts of comments is that when a member of one group generalizes or insults another group, a member of the offended group in turn generalizes or insults the entire other group in return, ignoring the fact that just makes them the same kind of asshole. 

Besides, older generations complaining about younger generations, and younger generations complaining about older generations has happened for thousand of years. Do people here not realize that in 30-40 years their grandkids are going to say EXACTLY the same things about them, just with different details. ""You ruined the world, you're out of touch, your values are archaic, you don't understand us, etc."""
"Maybe the old-fashioned way to spell old-fashioned is ""old-fahsioned"" tho"
"It's got a point but the stuff about creating websites and hacking is used so wrong. Any teenager these days watches a tutorial for an hour and most likely will be able to put together a decent website because it isn't rocket science. No, most of us don't know how to hack for shit. Especially not something that's genuinely a secured network.

Me neither. Please explain
"Man, I hope grandma's okay after reading that reply"
"It almost hits me as a Ken M. post. Especially with misspelling ""fashioned""."
"Boomers love to make jokes about how reliant younger people are on technology and social media. He was just making a cheeky (and pretty bad) joke about kids these days.

"Only if it's Backwards Week, otherwise they're dead."
"If it's too short then people complain it's not a true ""murdered by words"" but just a ""clever comeback"" or a ""burn"". This subreddit is for long replies. /r/clevercomebacks is for short ones. Nobody is ever happy apparently, people will complain whatever the posts are."
my first thought was kenm
"Thank you! I was scrolling through the comments and read far too many, “finally content worthy of this sub!” and “WOW an actual murder!” 

Really? The original comment comes off more as a joke (albeit a dumb one) than an actual “holier than thou” statement.

This was an attempted murder at best, but they just ended up shooting themselves in the foot."
"I think triggered is a really overused word that doesn’t fit as a comeback most of the time, but I don’t know how else to describe this response. I can’t believe the people in this thread lapping it up, it’s just a bunch of insults and vitriol towards someone who made a harmless joke."
"it is a murdered, but the guy who wrote a book in response to a joke is the one who got murdered"
I was thinking the same thing.
"Exactly. Holy shit, the older I get the more I realise just how socially retarded Reddit is.

The guy spent five or ten minutes typing a long response to a silly comment. My god, he must be so miserable.

Also the spelling mistake was just a typo and not a real one but he couldn't help mention it."
"Agree. After all, if that were true, all the children today would be brilliant."
My thoughts exactly. How insecure do you have to be to write such a reply to what is just an (admittedly badly made) joke about today's youth?
"Also, am I the only person who thinks the first comment might have been trolling with that misspelling? It read to me like a Ken M comment."
"By every available metric we have, humans are getting more intelligent with every generation. That's not something that's really debated, it's just scientific fact at this point. There's only debate over *why* it happens, like better nutrition, better healthcare, cheaper and more widely available schooling, lower amount of lead in the atmosphere, way more free and easily accessible learning resources like online books, etc. It's probably all of the above put together. Humans have never been smarter and more knowledgeable than they are right now. I could go find some studies for you about it if you want?

Annnnd, it’s true. I can’t spell for shit without the help of spellcheck."
"Yea, imagine seeing a harmless joke and then writing this novel. Calling him a bad parent wtf? I only see this sub when it’s on popular but it’s almost always this type of overreacting cringe, the fact that people find this “badass” is funny lol"
Yea pretty cringe. The original commenter was just making a joke and the person replying took it so literally and got so offended at such a harmless joke . My generation really is a bunch of “snowflakes” as they say
Agreed. Sometimes someone is trying so hard to murder with words that they end up looking like a douche bag with a butter knife.
"Why not just say ""them""?"
Jontron is a racist whire supremecist
"Commenting on a post about older generations shitting on younger people for being supposedly illiterate with: ""With our generation this is totally fine, but Gen Z might be illiterate""

Nice!"
"Yeah, I typically enjoy the destruction on this subreddit.  Barring the last line, this one just seemed like an angry child, mad at boomers humor.

I also don't believe that first part about kids these days hacking.  I'm sure there are several gifted individuals, but I've never met one and I work in the field of encryption, PKI services, and authentication.   

That said, I'm not sure most people understand what hacking actually is, nor how many flavors there are.  I get the impression that boomers think it works like the TV series 24, while the younger generation thinks it's as easy as MR Robot, albeit based in technical realities, makes it look.


Also, the last line was pretty amazing,"
Yea this is so cringe worthy. It’s like these people stop and think “hmm how can I get offended by this and try and make the other person look like a POS for a harmless joke”
Yep. le murdered by le words guiz???
"""Haha it's a jooke what are you on about"", said the person who's pushing their ego by bashing the youth in the most unintelligent and uninspired way possible and can't take any criticism"

Somebody's feelings.
The reply would have been a lot more effective if that's all it contained. Most of the rest is specious.
Imagine having the sheer fucking level of self restraint to read an innocent off-hand boomer joke and not write a fucking novel of butthurt.

2. Web Development is becoming easy do to these sites but, there is still people who know how to properly develop sites not using those sites so the point stands

3. I don't really see how that point is related. But yes that mistake is made so easily mainly because people don't care to look at the words they're using for a comment that will make sense regardless of if it's correct or not. 

4. Yes clearly a typo that was pointed out because the man is talking about how the young generation can't spell"

I'm a 33-year-old millennial. The only people I've ever heard talking about hacking or caring about hacking or building a website are people on Reddit. Nobody I know in real life cares that we can't build a website or hack into anything. I have no desire to learn how to. I don't understand your point (although I don't mean that in a rude way - I honestly just don't!)."
"I agree that *'Hacking'*, as in leveraging a deep understanding of computer, software & network architectures is definitely not a simple skill taught in low level education as the comment suggests.


However in fairness consider that the skills you listed (Wix, Squarespace, finding tutorials) are mountains to the technologically illiterate. I know people in their 50s who struggle to operate a smart phone or computer. I doubt they could find a tutorial or use Squarespace. Still, I guess being technologically literate doesn't make you smart- it's just like learning a language."
"There were things like WordPress, Wix and Squarespace for millenials too."

It's the same thing with learnt I think
"Spelt is a type of grain, but spelled can only be the past tense of spell which arguably makes it more correct"

"I think blue commenter is talking about millennials though. I feel lucky that I grew up in the earlier computing age. I learned how to take care of my computer and clean up bad files. I was the person in the dorm that people on my floor would come to when their computer was crashing because my millennial peers didn't know how to. I also learned how to write html in middle/high school for fun so I could make websites for my favorite gifs and to customize my neopets pages and eventually my livejournal and myspace. That's not a skill that every millennial has.

In my experience though millennials and zennials are completely capable of writing just as well as folks that are older than us. I agree though, they don't \*all\* know how to hack anything, there's probably a few people who care to learn.

The truth is somewhere in between both commenters."

"I'm a millennial and this year I've lost my job, and lost about half of the value in my 401k. I also haven't seen anyone except my roommates in the last four months, and a good chunk of my city burned in riots. So I guess you could say I've had it pretty easy. When my dad was 26 he was paying 75 dollars a month in rent, going to Prince shows, working part time at the family restaurant, and generally just fucking around, so things could definitely be worse for my generation."

"That’s the bit that got me too. No, kids are not ‘hacking into secure networks’ because if some dick-in-hand fifteen year old can wander in it’s not secure. I’m also not impressed by managing to slot some HTML together, it’s not hugely complex and to be honest I’ve known people of all ages who had equally challenging hobbies at that age.

Penetration testing is important where there's confidential data involved and even I haven't been exposed to that much outside of some of our larger clients where we had to use special security measures vs just the conventional methods.

I simply brought it up like that because the OP that this post is showing talks about hacking like it's something that everyone can do, which is false, and completely undermines the work of legitimate hackers, be it blackhats that do it illegally, or white hats that are paid to legally do it."

OK grandpa
is that how it's spelt?
"In British (so including 'English') English, the past participle of 'spell' is 'spelt'.

[Ed. Apparently we use both, but we certainly don't restrict ourselves to 'spelled'.]"
"But where I come from, ""spelt"" is the common spelling, and ""spelled"" is a less common variant. I was using the past tense of spell long before I was discussing types of grain. Neither spelling is ""more correct"", both get the message across and context also helps massively. I have had my spelling ""corrected"" too many times to count online because some people don't understand that in the UK, we spell some words differently to American English. This sort of correction implying that one spelling is incorrect almost always comes from Americans and I think that is probably the reason they brought up them being American."
Well he said arguably... so they are arguing about it.

It doesn't take long to weed out those that really know their craft from those who just started learning though, and I'd rather people just recognized that while it's great they can do something, they shouldn't try to undermine someone that actually knows what they're talking about."

She took them under her wing.
Its okay to use the real word 'birds'
Anyone know the name of the bird on the top right?
"Noun. **birb**  (plural birbs) (Internet slang, childish, humorous) Alternative form of  bird (a member of the class of animals Aves), especially one considered  small and cute.  


### [birb - Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/birb)"
"For sure, one of the cutest things in the world."
This is the best! Thank you!
no thats just a charging station station for the robots because birds aren't real
Fist 2 pictures looks like a mini jet engine
Birb it's not related only to parrots?
r/birdsarentreal
Look at all these mothertuckers
You can feel the oxytocin in the picture
Now I see it; the literal meaning of I take you under my wings.
Birbs?
Awww this makes me miss my mom. Mom hugs and protection can't be duplicated. Even now in my 40s I'd probably go see her on a bad day just to feel her arm on my shoulder. Never too old.
"Some individuals are saying that I should have used 'bird', not birb, in the title. Respectfully, I disagree. Birds are egg-laying vertebrate, who are often loud and annoying. On the other hand, birbs are tiny angels who should be protected at all costs. Therefore, it is proper of me to have used 'birb' in this context. And if you don't like it, shove it up your butt"
Really cute!

Didn't realize this was a thing.  It's awfully cute!
The swan looks like an avian carrier.
"I wish I could just unsee the really creepy face in the first two photos... The eyes of the babies form the eyes of the face, and the mother's tail feather forms a weird frown."
Birds.  They are birds.  Good lord.
I definitely thought the top two were some weird fish at first glance lmao
Idk why but I just assumed the first 2 pics were some weird looking fish.
Is it just me or are the top two just blobfish?
Omg from the first 2 pictures I thought it was alligators hiding in water
"I always like to imagine what kind of social conventions that other species will have if they become smart enough to develop a civilization. For birds what will it be like to be tucked under mummy's or daddy's wings. Does it help with bonding? Are there new bird parent guides that says that wing tucking is a great way to build bonds with your newly hatched babies.

Are there psychological issues to adults birds where their parents are aloof and never wing tucked them. Are there aristocratic birds where the lord and lady are absent parents and the young master grew up wing tucking under his nanny?

Are there bird sexual fetishes about wing tucking? Is there a stigma to grown adult birds liking wing tucking? Are there different bird cultures that see wing tucking in completely different light? Are there daddy birds getting arrested because they wing tuck their kids at the playground and some people overreacted and think that he is a pedophile?

My brain is fucked."
"just fyi: normal people call them ""birds""."
Anybody else think this looks comfy?
Yay! So happy to hear they’ve become get ready for a big baby bumping into everything

The apostrophe needs to be one character to the right: moms’

Edit: Damn. This needs to be a thing."
Its actually a defense tactic.When they get attacked the babies come out off the wing and when the attacker sees the little babies they fall asleep because of the sheer cutennes of the babies.

"Born in Northern Ireland we had to bow our heads and say the Lords Prayer every morning at school assembly. I know things have changed today because the country has become more secular but I didn't find out about other religions until I left school. In fact the only thing I guessed about Islam was that Mohammed was born at the same time of Jesus.

Only when I watched the TV program Cosmos did I start questioning things and came to my own conclusion that all religions are nonsense."

It’s easy for a religious person to spot the trick with everyone else’s religion. But because they were indoctrinated so early on in life to their own they have a massive blind spot there.
"It's what I told someone once, something like ""you only believe in X because you happened to be born in this country, had you been born in Egypt you'd be Muslim, in India and you'd be Hindu"" and he responded something like ""but it was God's will for me to be born here so that means this is the true religion"".

"This leads to a religious variant of [the Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem). Let's say each religion is a door, and behind one of these doors, that of the ""true"" religion is a prize (salvation or whatever). At birth, you've basically been randomly assigned a religion (i.e. selected a door). If you can confidently rule out any other religion like say scientology (i.e. open any other door), then converting to any other religion at random (i.e. switching doors) is the optimal strategy. 

Thus far, I have not been to convince any religious person to switch to another religion at random. It's like they don't care about maximizing their chance of finding the truth."
If you think religious people care about logic then you’re wrong. They just want to see their dead grandparents again.
Great quote definitely.
"Look, all I'm saying is, if you're so powerful, omniscient, all seeing, all judging, and you can deliver a Bible of text to multiple people a couple of thousand years ago, then why the fuck can't you show up now and do the same?

They feel they would always find a path to Christ, but I ask them what would happen if they were simply born in 1400s Australia? You'd be an Australian native. You would have no way of knowing about Christianity or Jesus for another century or two, there was just no contact yet between the continent and Europe. So I ask them what happened to generations of Australians, if Christianity is the only true/real religion, and they spent their whole life being pagans? Not out of choice, but because they didn't know and had no way of knowing there was Christianity across the ocean, but its existence was enough to condemn them all to hell?"

This always bothered me as a Mormon.
I feel the same way about  nationalism too.
Ah yes how thoughtful of God to put me in a family that allowed me to learn about TONS of religions and choose which felt right to me... None of them.
I haven't talked to a single religious person that can explain this to me. It's absurd your entire belief system is completely based on where you were randomly born
"This was the first thing that made me start questioning religion when I was a kid. When I found out how many different religions there were across the world. How many different versions of Christianity alone. Which one was ""right""?"
This to me is the single best argument against religion.  Your religion is basically dictated by your parentsand that line goes back and back and back to whereever you family originated.  Why should that determine a universal cosmic truth?
I call this targeted sponsorship of local businesses.

Once i had an argument with my friend about religion, i was like 8 so we where dumb. I asked how does he know his religion is the real one? How does he KNOW its the real one? Everyone else that belives in a different religion probably thinks the same exact thing, how do you know they aren't right? Lets say you are right and your religion is true and I'm being stupid, how do you know that it's true? Like if it is the real one, what points to the fact that it is true? So you are just saying everyone else in the world is wrong about their beliefs and you are right?

He always just said: i know my religion is the right one because, well, i just know! Yes everyone else is wrong about religion and i am right."

"There's actually a religion that was created in an attempt to explain this, [Cao Dai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caodaism)

I found out about it when my grandfather in Vietnam died. We weren't able to go to his funeral, but I saw video of hundreds of mourners paying their respects. I found out later that he was a high-level priest in Cao Dai.

The main belief of Cao Dai is that every major religion with one single god above all is true because it's the same god in different forms. All the discrepancies come from the errors of men who tried to interpret the teachings."
"It is very polite of him to do that.

Good job, Lord!"
i was born in protestant/anglican which is a religon which denies the holiness of the pope and patriachs but are still  in christian england and im  now orthodox which is a religon that denies the specialty of the pope but beleives in the holyness of the patriachs so it really doesnt work (also my parents were protestant)
But mine is different. Because I said so.

Amen
If you believe the Bible is witness to revelation then this argument falls apart easily.
or like when religious people move away from believing orthodox prespectives because they see moral flaws but still decide to believe in a faulty system any ways . Lol if religion was perfect there would just one . by logic religion is flawed
Checkmate
"The fact that people of different religions exist in the same country, and many people are dieing for a religion they believe in and gain nothing for it when in a country that's against this religion invalidate this whole quote.

Atheists constantly have their head stuck in a western worldview thinking that religions are peaceful and religions are all about money to the point that they make no sense. Where do you see that in China? Middle east? Etc? In the case of Christianity, people are being tortured and slaughtered for not rejecting Christianity, and have nothing to gain for clinging onto Christianity. Try telling them ""you are only a believer because you are afraid of what's after/to get money"". You'll be an utter fool to even the persecutors to think that people choose to have faith because of the thought of a peaceful afterlife that they cannot see, at the detriment of being in constant pain and suffering in this life they know and see. NO ONE who thinks rationally can think that people would throw away their life they know for an afterlife they never saw."

While yes if you're born into a religion you of course will have bias with it.  However people that tend to want to study and learn about religion tend to convert to Christianity.

"Theist from r/all here to weigh in respectfully. As cliche as it sounds I do believe most religions are equally valid, and they are different manifestations of a single greater power.

I refuse to believe that everything was an accident, that we are just bags of chemicals undergoing uncountable reactions every second. I believe in the soul. So to the point of the article maybe it’s unironically true, that every religion is the true one to some extent."

Atheism is by definition not a religion. Some atheists are religious in the way they acquired and communicate atheism though.
"I imagine what people think when they say atheism is a religion is that it requires some form of belief that God doesn't exist, because his existence can't technically be disproven. While that's not how science works (burden of proof), it's also incorrect because religion, by definition, requires some amount of ritualistic behavior. That's why when someone does something religiously, it means that they do it incessantly and repetitively. Praying, baptizing, fasting, offerings, sacrifice, proselytizing, all of these things are elements of religion which must be done. Atheism cannot be a religion because there is no religious act needed to satisfy the requirement to be atheist. You just have to realize it's all fake. In the same vein, believing in the existence of God or Gods but having it stop there without any religious habits at all would also qualify as not being a religion."
Look at Hinduism. You would find atheism in that. That's why it's hard to point Hinduism as a religion and more of a way of life.
">""That was not the case with your own religion.""

At the same time points out the validity of atheism. Dawkins points out that the same religion doesn't pop up in different places independently of each other, and this guy points out atheism does.

If atheism was considered a religion, it would have stronger evidentiary support than all the others."
I am not convinced it is not a religion to some people.
"Atheism is a religion because it’s just as much an act of faith to claim there is no God(s) than there is to believe in a deity. Neither stance can be proven or disproven, it’s all blind faith."
"Well, the thing to remember is that the definition of religion is pretty vague.  You could argue, for example, that science is a religion.  It comes with a series of behaviours and morals.  Various texts, religious buildings (labs/schools/libraries), priests (scientists) a degree of faith that the guy whose gotten qualifications in his field actually knows what hes talking about.  Even charlatans (Dr. Oz)..."
"Depends. A firm unwavering belief in anything is a religion. 

As an atheist I do not believe there is anything after, if someone could prove that to me I would be willing to examine and ultimately change my mind. 

Absent of a god themselves showing me I don’t see it happening. 

Now if I refused to change my mind even after being presented with new evidence then in fact I have subscribed to a religion as it is no longer a scientific method by which my reasons are based."
"Uh oh. Here comes the ""Actually, atheism can't be a religion because we don't believe in any magic sky fairies"" crowd. Water tight arguments everybody."
"Actually, there are arguments for this that make sense.

The belief that there is no god is very much a belief. The idea that there is probably no god is not.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_atheism

So if anything it looks like you are the ignorant here."
"I mean Atheism IS faith based, just based in the faith that no deity is real. It’d be rather hard to prove one did or didn’t considering science can only measure things via comparison."
Yeah definitely doesn’t have anything to do with culture or traditions of an area.
"Brainwashing from a very early age is how religion thrives.

Fair play to Jeremy Vine on his radio show one day many years ago when a caller said something like ""My 5 year old has stronger beliefs than me over Jesus so therefore the power of God must be real.""

He's also a believer but he put her on the spot and critiqued her about brainwashing the child."
"You cant rely on logic to sway a religious person, at least not when it comes to religion. Believing requires faith, which is by definition belief without proof. So, to believe, you specifically have to disregard logic, and it is considered a virtue to do so. Logical inconsistency and picking and choosing are some of the most powerful tools for them to justify things."
Here's what blows my mind about every highly religious person. They think that they are unique and more special than all 7.6 billion other people in the world. Somehow God favours them alone above everyone else. Such a narcissistic and arrogant presumption to make.
I would not doubt that at least some religious people would argue that they are born into the true religion because they were born [insert race/ethnicity] which are God's chosen.
"I'm not sure this analogy holds water. A key part of the Monty Hall problem is that the presenter, who knows which door is right, is the one who picks which door to show you. There's no equivalent for that in your analogy (instead you find the wrong door yourself) so I'm inclined to doubt it."
"Seems pretty compelling to an outsider, but...

Imagine the Monty Hall problem but with each door saying ""this is the correct door... but some day a door will be presented that lies to all of humanity leading them into darkness and despair"" but with each door in a different language, and each of the contestants speaking a different subset of languages.

Luckily, we've solved the Monty Hall problem. Humanity, however, seems to be a tougher nut."
"This seems iffy to me. I could be totally wrong so help me work this out.

First, let's look at the math. Since there are multiple religions, does extending the Monty Hall problem to arbitrary N doors change the optimal choice? No. It's still in your best interest to switch after a door is revealed to be wrong.  [See this math.se answer.](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/608957/41677)

Next, let's look at the analogy. Can we replace the doors with a set of (highly contested) premises? Let's substitute it with something like Theory of Everything candidates (e.g. String Theory etc.). A scientist is assigned a random theory. If someone disproves one theory, even a ridiculous one from an undergrad's late term paper, then if what you say is true then it is in the best interest of the scientist to switch to another random theory. Nope, the search for truth doesn't work that way.

Say that instead of doors being a set of religions, the doors are a set of positions on the nature of god. (So that atheism is included in one of the doors.) Then you were assigned the door ""atheism"" randomly. Knowing what you know, is it still in your best interest to switch even if you know that so many other doors are wrong? I don't think so. There are more non-round-about criticisms of religion than this."
"This doesn't work, because you might also discover information that says that your original religion is false. So it's like the variant of Monty Hall where Monty always shows at random one of the doors without the prize behind it, even if that door was the one originally chosen.

In this variant of the problem if Monty happens to show you one of the doors you didn't pick then there isn't any advantage to switching. Each of the remaining doors is equally likely."
"But the only way to prove if a door is the one that has a prize is by dying, so, there is not an optimal way to search for the truth, because you will have only one chance to open a door."
"Does switching from Catholic, to Christianity count?"
I think you just convinced me! I am far from religious but I was brought up catholic. I’m going to switch to Islam to see how that feels like. I would try Judaism but I don’t think they would accept me lol.
My brain just melted trying to understand that. It hit me like a ton of bricks when I got it. I just woke up and already working out the mind thanks!
"I think the one problem with your analogy is how do you know one of the doors is ""correct"" or better... Sure for most people a new car is better than a goat.  But is Islam better than Christiantity or atheist or deist etc. There is a 33% that they were ""correct"" to begin with as well. All of this is a BIG factor for the person choosing to be convinced to ""pick another door""."
"Which version? It's not like we know whether you get to see the worm-infested corpse reanimated, the 20 year old who you never even met, or the 80 year old who was getting so weak, and no one knew why, until the cancer diagnosis a year later."

That isn't cliche, that is just stupid. All religions can't be equally valid because they all make claims that contradict one another.

Well good, because you shouldn't believe that. Especially since the only people that say something along these lines are theists that don't understand what science says about the origins of the universe, life, consciousness, etc.

Great. Mind explaining what a soul is and how such a thing could even possibly exist based on everything we know about the brain?"

Exactly. Nothing particularly intellectual or noteworthy or this quote and this point has been hammered as far back as when Rome wanted religious freedom. It’s not a very valid quote when you consider other religious as simply different interpretations of divinity.

I once had a discussion with a Young Earther and we were discussing the vast scales of the Universe. He hit me with the 5,000 year old Earth and that the size of the Universe must be wrong. I was actually stumped to answer him because I just took it as a fact that the Universe is 13bn years old. That's when I started to not just accept facts because they are facts but to understand how those facts were generated. 

I now know small distances to the Moon, planets and nearby stars are calculated by simple trigonometry while we use further and further things like Cepheid variables, Supernova and Redshift for other measurements.

"It's a pushed apologetic from the evangelical churches. It goes something like this:

Religion is a belief. It takes faith to be a good believer and that belief is a choice. It's pushed that even though sometimes you may be faced with evidence to the contrary, it's good to just believe. 

Science is telling people that God isn't real. That evolution is real. They say that you're taking it at faith that the scientists are accurate or that they have an agenda. 

Do they've now built this false equivalency of, you have to choose, but both options are choices, or belief systems.

"It's not that weird. What is a sports team but a tribal identity for the modern age? What is a religious denomination for the lay person but a tribal identity? 

If a person thinks socially in terms of tribes, defines their identity in terms of tribes, and projects their personal experience and values on other people (because we ALL do that last one, it's why a lot of young atheists are baffled by the theists inability to see the logical flaws in their belief system), then it makes sense to assume atheism is a tribe in itself.

And, in a way, they're right. Atheists are not a dogmatic organization, but we do have active communities, seek each other out, and can bond over the shared attribute.

In a world where religious affiliation is a part of your social identity, lack of affiliation is as much a defining trait as Episcopalian, and that's really what it's about to your average person. Never-left-the-county-Courtney doesn't have the tools nor desire for a real theological debate (probably doesn't even know WHY their denomination is different from the one across town), but understands communities. To them, RELIGION is just a word that means tribe regarding religious affiliation/community aka tribe.

And when you have a smartypants try to do the same thing in a debate, it's usually just in bad faith. They HAVE to frame atheism as a 'bad' religion because conceding that someone can live a fulfilling life without religion, when you're advocating for a religious organization that promises that it's the only way to have a fulfilling life if you give up time every week and 10% of your income, well, you can see how that's less than good for their position. They're just left with Hell at that point and most atheists in the debate field would LOVE to corner a theist on the topic of Hell."
"No, I worship science."
"My housemate was born Muslim and still practices lightly but is quite removed from it. She asked me about my background and although I'm baptised, both parents are atheists and religion never played a part in my life.

She was shocked at this but  ultimately admitted she was very envious of this"
"I think it’s because one definition of religion is “a particular system of faith and worship”. Religion isn’t just about believing a sky daddy, because that doesn’t cover the broad set of things we call religion all over the world. It’s a system of dogmatic beliefs based on faith. While not required, I think it’s fair to say some atheists are “dogmatically atheist”, saying “there is no god!” from a faith perspective (as in they insist on it without evidence) rather than driven by reason. 

For instance, a teenager rebelling against his catholic parents and suddenly deciding that there is not god without examining any arguments could be called “religiously atheist” I’d say. Source: I was that teenager. The atheist community is broad and isn’t some monolith. It has “sects”, and some are more like reformist where others are more like orthodox."
"I think the issue may be in definitions. I assume many atheist’s definition of the term “religion”, and even many religious people’s definition, is something like this: “the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods”. That understanding of religion is narrow in scope and makes it difficult to see why someone would say everyone has their own religion.

But if you use the following definition for religion, then it begins to make more sense that a person adhering to a traditional religion would say an atheist is religious.

Religion: a particular system of complete trust or confidence in someone or something and adoration or devotion shown toward that someone or something."
"If you frame all beliefs as “faith systems”, atheism has points of faith for adherents.  The primary difference between a religious faith system and an atheistic one is that atheists typically believe that things that are not well understood have a rational answer that hopefully will be understood one day.  So faith is placed in the assumption that there is an explanation that can be understood within our shared natural reality.  Religious folks more readily place their faith in a supernatural explanation.  Both systems take faith on the part of the adherents.  Faith in something that is not understood is a component of religion so in this sense, atheism has a religious characteristic."
"Maybe atheism isn't directly a religion, but most atheists replace religion with something else, usually bureaucracy."
"I know this will probably be deleted. But I’ve been to this sub a few times, and the contempt here for anything that is even remotely religious goes way beyond a simple disbelief. My bet is that a lot of people come here regularly because they are attempting to quiet that little voice in their head that does believe."

That's not a ""sort of statement"", that is word for word literally calling atheism a religion."
"Then it is a belief, not a religion. Religion is so much more than just a belief. There is a mythos, there are rituals, sometimes a hierarchy, there are rules (cant eat pork for exemple). Atheism is none of that. And were talking about ""hard atheism"", agnosticists are not religious at all."
It doesn’t take faith to not believe in something that has no actual evidence as of yet.
"Atheism isn't inherently making any claims. Theism claims there are gods; atheism simply REJECTS the claim, it does not claim the opposite. Even if it did make a claim, how does a claim make it a religion? If a claim is based on evidence, that's not religious at all."
"Athe*ism* makes no claims.  Some athe*ists* do.  Atheism is nothing more than a ""No."" response to the ""Do you believe a god exists?"" question.  Strong atheism takes the extra step of making a claim but atheism in general does not.

Atheism is a response to religion.  The word would not even exist in the absence of unsubstantiated religious claims."
>It's just as much an act of faith to claim there is no Father Christmas than there is to believe in Santa Claus.

No, these things are nowhere near equivalent."
"These are all superficial comparisons. The key difference between science and religion is that science never asks anyone to believe anything for which there is not at least *some* evidence, and when contradictory evidence comes to light, science admits it's wrong and changes its mind. Religions do the opposite: they demand belief without evidence (= faith) and steadfastly refuse to alter their tenets in the face of either overwhelming evidence to the contrary, or a total lack of any supporting evidence."
"If all religious and science texts and knowledge of religion and science disappeared and humans had to start over from scratch, then science would come back the same way as it is now. Because it's based on observations in the real world. You would have all the same information in science textbooks. Religions would not. You wouldn't have an exact copy of Christianity  or the Bible or Hinduism or Buddhism or the book of mormon. There would be a completely different set of religions with different characters and myths. That's the difference and that's why science isn't a religion."

That means that we don't think there's a god--in fact, most of us would say that we're 99.9999% sure that the god described in Judeo-Christian traditions does not exist.  But we're not 100% sure, because we're open to empirical evidence that would change our minds.

None exists.

However, it's also nice of you to say that any atheist who is willing to say that there is no god is in a religion.

TL;DR: Nice try, but we're still nowhere near like you. :)"
"It's faith based in the same way you need to have faith that green goblins don't rule the universe.

By that definition though everything is faith-based, which makes the use of the word ridiculous."
"I don't think it's faith based at all. Atheism isn't the belief that there is no deity. Rather it's accepting that there is no evidence or proof for a deity. I don't have to have faith that something isn't real, it just isn't real unless you can prove otherwise."
"Saying atheism is faith based is like saying bald is a hair color. Its not a ""something else"" belief, its a lack of belief. Its not that I like a different sport than you, its that I don't play sports.

Same for religion. I don't play religion, just entirely do not participate in the idea."
"You don't need to positively believe there is no deity to be atheist. As long you do not believe in a god, you are one. For example, I don't know that there are no gods, I've just never seen anything that would indicate there is one, and I find it completely pointless to think about it. And I'm an atheist."
That makes you a pedophile because not fucking children is also based on sexual preference.
"No, atheism is based on the lack of belief (or ""faith"" if you will) in deities. The reason I lack this is because I see no evidence for it. It's the same type of faith that makes me believe there are no green elephants floating around in space. So in the same way you could argue that vegetarian dishes are meat-based in that they avoid all meat."
"Well said.

That's also why selecting bad quotes from the Bible to ask them about is ineffective: they've already made their mind up that the overall message is good and from God himself.  It's all faith."
"Faith is not by definition without proof. That's blind faith. Proper faith is based on reason and evidence.

For example, if I need to have an important surgery I might first research the various doctors that perform such a surgery and then choose to put my faith in one to perform it on me.

Blind faith would be just putting my faith in a doctor without looking into it at all."
"Definitely not true... there is a lot of logic involved with faith, which actually is best viewed as “trust” and not belief without proof. There is actually lots of “proof”....historical, philosophical, and scientific. God created all of these things and the human mind with reason and logic—- so he wants you to use it. Idiots are everywhere, so if you just talk to religious people that are dumb, then you’ll just have confirmation bias and they will reinforce your belief that they are ALL stupid and can’t think with reason or logic. It’s good as a religious person to listen to these arguments and other ways of thinking with open mindedness tho for sure."

"Don't think it quite works with scientific theories because they're not blind faith choices. The doors would need to be transparent and list all the evidence for them too allow for an informed opinion on each. Also the scientific community would remove doors if they are consistently and independently shown to not be an accurate theory, where as no amount of evidence would lead to a religous door being removed. The only way to remove a religous door would be the eventual death of everyone who picked it before then to tell you about it, and destruction of all writing about it."
"Right. The analogy only works if there was no way to verify a religion's truth, when in reality, it's quite easy to get enough information to decide if a religion is false or not."
That isn’t a problem with his analogy. It’s an assumption that his analogy makes: that one of the currently active religions is the “true religion” and we don’t know which one it is.
"What a flawed argument. If there is a God, he/she would have been made by something too. Regardless of believing in a God or not, something came out of nothing. At least, 'nothing' as far as our science can tell us and ever can tell us.

And are you really trying to invoke science to argue in favor FOR a God?"
"It's funny you say ""scientifically impossible"" when you're just so ignorant of science."
"That is not what atheists believe. Atheism is disbelief in theism, generally any sort of god entity. You could be an atheist Buddhist, since some variations of Buddhism are not theist. There are many flavors of atheist, and many theories on how the universe came to be."

I am an atheist and I can attest that I couldn't care less about whether there is an explanation about reality.
"> If you frame all beliefs as “faith systems”, atheism has points of faith for adherents. The primary difference between a religious faith system and an atheistic one is that atheists typically believe that things that are not well understood have a rational answer that hopefully will be understood one day. So faith is placed in the assumption that there is an explanation that can be understood within our shared natural reality. Religious folks more readily place their faith in a supernatural explanation. Both systems take faith on the part of the adherents. Faith in something that is not understood is a component of religion so in this sense, atheism has a religious characteristic.  
  
Why frame it as a “faith system”? Atheism is the disbelief in theistic claims about deities. That’s it. There is no faith system. No doctrine.  Atheism takes zero faith."

That is more than simply saying Christianity is wrong, or Islam, or Hinduism, and so on. It is a blanket statement. Atheism has no evidence to support its position. Atheism can not be proven just as other religions cannot be proven. It takes blind faith to be an atheist because fundamentally an atheist is making in unprovable evidence-less claim. Whether you call that a religion or a belief is irrelevant, because it’s dancing around the same concept, that it’s still all blind faith in a particular view of the structure of the universe."

> There is actually lots of “proof”....historical, philosophical, and scientific.

There are no philosophical arguments that prove god. All of them fail at one level or another.

Or if you aren't, and you are Jewish or Muslim, odds are your family raised you in that religion rather than the dominate one of the country. And this is even further backed up by the fact that people don't tend to convert to completely different religions. Like you don't tend to see Christians jumping over to Judaism. At best most converts will tend to jump from one denomination to another because the core beliefs are still roughly the same and it is that is what they are familiar with as that is what they were surrounded by."

"Interesting topic of philosophical debate is one thing, fanaticist atheism as part of your identity is another — especially when tied to actual ulterior motives, like conversion and/or wiping out religious beliefs (which honestly would prob be better for everyone, yes). Self-perceived intellectual superiority and telling others they’re uneducated and uniformed is a pretty key indicator (hint hint), but if you don’t fit the bill then then shrug it off and don’t be a clown with eyeroll-inducing trolling assertions. It’s also worth reflecting on whether you can detach from your supposed philosophical side chats on the internet and keep them from toxically spilling into your daily offline life and negatively affecting how you perceive the world and people around you. BTW, that’s true of anything really. 

I remember a time when I thought it would be hilarious to carry around leather-bound, gold-leafed copies of Origin of Species and The God Delusion (ok it’s still amusing, if such versions existed I wouldn’t object to shelving them). That woulda been trolling for sure. And toxic. Just like the Darwin fish I briefly had on my car to advertise my ~~religious~~ atheism in high school until someone ripped it off. Just as much as there is toxicity in religion itself, there’s toxicity in devoting a significant amount of your life and energy to telling people online (and fantasizing about doing it in person) that their religion is wrong, even when it is."
"That sounds like more of an agnostic statement, but that’s cool."
"This could get into semantics about what it means to be an atheist.  

After reading the God Delusion, my impression is that Richard Dawkins defines atheism not just by the absence of God, but also by the “better” evidence for a natural explanation.  There are points to that evidence that require faith that a plausible explanation exists because certain elements of the universe, origins, etc are not fully understood."
"Ok, I'll say some instead of most because I personally know some who do this."
"Certain people now use an expansion of government where they would have used an expansion of church in previous eras. Too much poverty, perhaps more social programs arethe answer? Racism,  perhaps more laws will solve the problem? I can't find a job, maybe the government will pay me? To me, that has an altar-type feel. I live near Chicago and there are many people who do this. I'm not saying this is a characteristic of all atheists, and I walked back my most comment as I have no proof it's over half. Many aethists, though, try to find something to replace the religious zealotry of there ancestors with a different zealotry. That is what I mean by they replace religion with bureaucracy."

If I may, I'd suggest we use [this ancient edict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyFvGL3Z5F8) as a starting point for our own heavenly laws.

Good to have you, brother!"
Oof. You just made everything you said a complete joke with that comment.
Typical response is typical
Ewww
"What part of never being presented with evidence for a god requires me to have faith?

I don't believe God isnt real. I know God isnt real, UNLESS you can provide evidence/proof that shows otherwise."
"he literally said the opposite, he never said he believes there is no god, he said he accepts that there is no proof of one."
Not even remotely the same thing and just conflates the concepts. Intuition is not faith.
"Nope. He's describing himself as an atheist.

""disbelief **or lack of belief** in the existence of God or gods."""
It's true that I'm agnostic. But I am also atheist. [They are not mutually exclusive terms.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic_atheism)
"If there was an omniscient god, they'd know how to do it. It would probably involve breaking a few laws of physics or something. 
I'm agnostic atheist myself. Whether or not supernatural things exist or not is technically an unknowable but I live as if no gods exist. Knowledge of the supernatural would, by definition, be beyond us or science anyway so even if they did exist, it changes nothing."
"I didn’t say that. But with reasoning and logic applied to science and philosophy, you can look at the universe around you and absolutely believe it was designed by a creator... and I’m not taking about 21st century views of creation. Im a Christian evolutionist and fully believed that we evolved from single cell organisms. There are lots of different ways of thinking out there and many people who believe in religion who have plenty of intelligence."
"I didn't mean if someone came back from the dead. Bad wording on my part there I think. I meant that each religous door would remain an option for as long as it's existence as an option was known about by humanity, either in living or written records.

The only only reason a door would be removed would require all living people with knowledge of the door to have died, and all written evidence of the door ever existing being destroyed. I don't think even the founder of a religion would necessarily be able to remove the door, as it's too easy to claim by the people still following it that the founder has been corrupted and can no longer be trusted.

Theory doors could be removed as options because the evidence against them being choices reached a critical threshold."
"But something eternal and uncreated has to come from something given the guys logic. He can't just apply the logic of something from nothing for one thing, and something eternal and uncreated for another thing."
"Because their statement on ""nothing created everything"" being scientifically impossible is nonsense, it's a fundamental misunderstanding of the various theories of the beginning of the universe. If they wanted to make some grand sweeping statement about how science purports to explain the creation of the world, they should first actually be knowledgeable about this field."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plVk4NVIUh8 this is the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria in real-time (sped up of course).

For proof on a larger scale, we have fossil records."
"Yeah I could, but burden of proof is on you so I'm more interested in you actually following debate etiquette."
"You are a dumb religious automaton, there is no point discussing with you. You are free to keep on believing whatever bullshit fairytale you wanna believe. No need to come to this sub and preach."
"Yet that is exactly what you are.

Edit: woof, rustled some jimmies with the useful idiots on this sub lol."
Then why did you ask what logic when his logic was sound?
So you’re saying the universe has always existed in retroactive eternity?
"> If it were possible to actually observe something like that

“If science could explain it, it would”

So it can’t, which is exactly what I said"
"""still"" nah i become a muslim after thorough research. Right, since you give that example, i couldn't research Islam and couldn't become a muslim. But in islam you are not responsible to become a muslim if you don't know about it, like cavemen for example."
My religion isn't local.
... The point you made is interesting because you want god to save her
Well then don't.
Yes it was God who created the iPhone and all modern tech he just did it using humans as a vessel
"Yep. When the equipment shows they're wrong, their only response is, ""that's interesting."""
"I haven't actually watched it, but from all the videos I saw on reddit it seemed like at least part of the film crew was in on the ""this is bullshit"" and pointed to the facts for people to pick up. Not that I believe the Earth is flat, but I've  never seen a flat earther use ""behind the curve"" as evidence from that show. Even the name behind the curve implies that the people thinking the Earth is flat is on the backside of the learning curve."
Torches?
Well... not anymore. But back in my college days...
"> I've seen no evidence for them, nor have I heard a plausible explanation for a mechanism by which they could exist. 

an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. for example, you can't *know* for certain that aliens don't exist somewhere in the universe, so just because we haven't experienced them here on Earth doesn't mean they don't exist. *believing* they don't exist would limit our potential to come in contact with them, and grow as a species. people in SETI remain open to the idea that alien life could exist, otherwise that endeavor would not be taken on. using your logic, just because we haven't seen something means it doesn't exist. that is completely antithetical to scientific thought. remaining open to ideas (yes, including God) is how progress is made."
"Any atheist that is not this, an agnostic atheist, assumes the burden of proof. That is they must themselves show that a god does not exist. I have no idea how you could go about that, so I too am an agnostic atheist."
Well explained! Many people don’t understand that the proper identification is agnostic atheists. Most pluralistic/tolerant religious people are agnostic theists. It’s the fundamentalists that are gnostic theists.
"semantics aside, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."
"yeah i agree to this logically but that way of thinking gives those fairy tale believers too much ground imo... if i tell you there is an invisible magic unicorn in my basement, you wouldn't be agnostic to that, you would rightfully call out my BS and think i'm a nutjob, dont you think?"
Or like anywhere in the UK
"I watch a lot of sports, and would consider myself a fan, but don’t really a have a favourite team. I just watch games that I think will be really exciting because I like to see the best athletes perform.

But yea I get what he means with the extreme homers"
"Then you've just explained precisely WHY atheism isn't a religion. I don't believe without evidence or with complete trust that ""atheism"" is true. I don't believe in gods because the evidence isn't there. I also don't ""devote"" myself to the ""teachers"" of atheism. I think people like Hitchens have some insightful and witty remarks about the role of religion in society and the weaknesses of theistic claims, but I also think Hitch said some insanely stupid things about Islam, about the Iraq War, etc. There are no ""tenets"" of atheism, there are no ""leaders,"" there is no unifying view, there is no blind trust, there is no devotion. If someone came right now and proved a God claim to me, I'd convert instantly. Even using your own contrived definition, atheism isn't a religion."
"Picking and choosing parts of definitions of related words does not a definition make. Let’s have a look:
  
Google definition of religion: *“the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods.“*.  
Myrriam-Webster: *“(1) the service and worship of God or the supernatural”* it does also say *“(2) : commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance”* but that feeds back into (1)  
The Cambridge dictionary: *”the belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship:“*  
  
Here is another one for you: “Atheism: the disbelief in theistic claims about deities“.  
Lack of belief in something is not a religion. If it was:  
* a christians lack of belief in Islam, is also a religion.  
* My lack of belief in Bigfoot, is also a religion.  
* Your lack of belief in you being wrong, is also a religion."
"We could, but you are in r/atheism. The definitions are in the FAQ."
"Richard Dawkins is *not* to atheists as priests are to religious people. There are no central authority of atheism, and there is no one person whose definition is more true than another."
"- Poverty 
- Racism
- Unemployment 

If the atheists you know are concerned with these socioeconomic issues and replace religion in attempt to to solve them, isn’t this ultimately *good*?

Like seriously, if people view these sorts of political issues as their priority, those sound like great fucking people. Humanists. Let’s get shit done for the betterment of the majority of our race. Let’s eradicate the real evils in the world. 

It just baffles me that this sort of political activism is seen as “religious” or “altar-like”. To me, I see it as admirable."
You also don't live in a world that is run by the disciples of Santa and his holly jolly teachings.
"If everyone in your life thought Santa was coming back in a few years to take us all to the North Pole and our job in the meantime was to act as good elves for Him, you'd probably join an anti-Santa forum too."

"Joel Osteen will be the last person there, holed up in his stadium, locked in, while his congregation claw at the windows and walls and doors trying to find shelter."
I'm a Justskin heretic.
"I’m asking this in good faith, I’m not a troll I swear. Just a dude that came from r/all. Can you elaborate on the difference between those two statements, and how the former is not agnosticism? I always thought atheism was as I stated it to be, and that agnosticism was the belief that there is a higher power but that it’s impossible to know which religion is right."
"What part of never being presented with evidence for a lack of god requires you to be atheist? 

Surely there is no Christian god, or Hindu, or w.e. Surely, I mean I don’t know, but they’d act more like in their stories and we would see, right? But who’s to say there isn’t some cosmic consciousness to the universe itself or something? I mean idk.

But to shirk the possibility and instead believe it’s impossible is STILL FAITH. It’s a belief, belief is faith."
"It is remotely the same thing. It's information of interpretation of reality stemming from unconscious parts of the brain, made conscious through feeling and thought. And of course, intuition equals not faith, but that was not the point."
I'm stupid. You're smart. I was wrong. You were right. You're the best. I'm the wrost. You're very good-looking. I'm not very attractive. I stand corrected.
"I highly doubt the possibility of an omniscient god, so in that regard I’m almost an atheist. I think if there is a god its more of a natural phenomena, like invisible cogs turning in the background of the cosmos, as like you I need some evidence.

Interpretation however... the Earth is crazy. So is the Galaxy. Math slightly off and we burn to a crisp. So many things work so perfectly it’s almost as if the universe was designed to. The fact there even ARE laws of physics in the first place.... this could BE evidence, that the universe itself knows what it’s doing. But omniscient omnipresent god that cares about individual people? Yeah that’s a tough sell"
">There is actually lots of “proof”....historical, philosophical, and scientific. God created all of these things and the human mind with reason and logic—- so he wants you to use it."
"> Theory doors could be removed as options because the evidence against them being choices reached a critical threshold.

I don't see why this couldn't apply to religion doors. In reverse, we could remove theory doors even if there are still scientists that believe in it (like unscientific alternatives to theories with consensus). No one has to die."
"I don't understand. Something eternal and uncreated doesn't have to come from something, that's the nature of being eternal and uncreated. The universe around us has been overwhelmingly observed to not be eternal and uncreated. We have empirically observed it existing in constant flux and change, and governed by laws of causality. No one as far as I know, not the religious nor atheists, believe the observable universe to be eternal and uncreated. The question is if there is another entity (""God"") that does have such properties. And in that discussion, arguing that such an entity must have been created doesn't make sense."
"Could you be more specific about fossil records? How long ago it was? If you will say that it was millions of years ago, then it is not observable. Sorry but you must have faith in it. I call it blind faith"
">Oh no, this guy is getting useless karma for free! Anyone who likes this Dawkins quote is now an idiot!

--You, the smart guy in the room."
No you are being downvoted for being a dick.
I am not saying anything. You made the claim that there was nothing. Prove it.
"It can't yet, or as far as we know currently.

But the idea that it can't be explained at all needs to be demonstrated, so you need to get on that if you are going to make such a claim."
Then it sounds like it is an argument to me.
How do you know it's the right one?
Prove it.
Whoa. Did god invent the atomic bomb?
I would be very careful with you if you were to make this claim. I wouldn't call you out on your BS in a nasty way because I understand mental illness. But that's not really the point. I gave you the meanings of the two words. That's it. I also will not place a burden of proof onto myself. That would be ridiculous. I can't prove that no god exists. But I won't believe in one until such time as theists provide sufficient evidence of one.
"Hello fello asportheist. We're a huge bunch.

I love tennis but have no one favorite player. But I still watch all matches I get time for regardless of the players."
Ok billions watch sports
"Fair enough. 

I’m obviously not an atheist but I do believe all worldviews have places of assumption/faith."
"I agree, it’s just that this thread was started by a Richard Dawkins quote.  Of course everyone is entitled to their assumed beliefs and all the different nuances those beliefs entail."
"Blasphe-you! But also, Laprohaig ftw."
"Theism is the position that there are gods. Atheism is just not adopting that position. If someone points to a jar of gumballs and says ""I can just tell that the number of balls in there is an even number, do you believe me?"", and I respond ""no, I do not believe you,"" does that mean I think the number is odd? No, it just means I don't think they know the answer, not that I think I know the answer and it's the opposite of what they said. If you took out the gumballs and counted them and proved it was even, then I'd believe. Atheism is a tentative rejection due to lack of evidence. As to agnosticism, I don't think gnosticism and theism are on the same axis. Gnosticism deals with knowledge, and theism deals with belief. Knowledge is a subset of belief. So it isn't theism -> agnostic -> atheism like a number line, it's theism -> atheism on a belief axis and gnosticism -> agnosticism on a knowledge axis. So you could be a gnostic theist, an agnostic theist, a gnostic atheist, an agnostic atheist, etc. How one defines ""knowledge"" is obviously relevant, I tend to use the definition of ""so certain that it would be life-altering or world-view changing to learn you were wrong."" From here it's important to distinguish between different god-claims. I am extremely certain that the Greek gods are made up, not real. I am a gnostic atheist with respect to that claim. I believe they are not real, and I am so certain that I would say I know it to be true. I feel the same way about the Christian God. But about other claims, I am less certain. For example, the Deistic God, a creator God that set the universe into motion 13 billion years ago and hasn't interfered since. I do not believe that to be true, I haven't seen any evidence that makes me believe it is true, but it's such a vague claim and not widely held that evidence for or against that just isn't sought by anyone, so I suppose it could be true. I don't believe it, but I'm not as certain of that. Maybe this creator God was what ""triggered"" the big bang, who knows. So I'd call myself an agnostic atheist with respect to that claim. In my prior comment, the first statement is agnostic atheism or ""soft"" atheism, the latter is gnostic or ""hard"" atheism. Atheists have differing views about the evidence for gods. Some think the evidence for is just weak, some think the evidence against is quite strong. I take it claim by claim for each God. Hopefully this clarifies some things."
"Meh. Just because you don't understand how stuff works, doesn't make it supernatural. The earth looks amazing to us just because we are perfectly adapted to it. If a rain puddle was conscious, would it think ""wow, this hole in the tarmac must be made by an intelligent designer because it suits me just perfectly""?
Similarly, if universal constants were different, the world as we know it might be different, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of life or galaxies forming or anything, they would just look differently. 
That there are physical laws is peculiar indeed, but I doubt it has a supernatural cause. There is certainly no evidence for it."
"He edited his comment first of all which changed the context. But to answer his question anyways.... “Proof” is in quotations for a reason. I’m using the term lightly and that’s why I explain that reason and logic is how you apply history, philosophy, and science to faith. But I’m not going to get into a reddit argument about it. It’s too long of a conversation and one to discuss in person with someone over a long time. That’s not a cop out too. There really is no way to discuss online all the complexities of this topic."
"I think I've realised the issue. By remove I don't mean the opening and showing of it to be true or not true, or as in opened and confirmed to be not the prize as in the original Monty Hall problem.

I mean just when compiling the list of doors. The Theory door list would not include objectively disproven theories, like say the Flat Earth model. It doesn't matter what any individual ""Scientist believes"" as that's a faith based assertion.

The list of Religion doors would be all religions currently known about. There's no disproving a religion before opening the door, even the founder of the religion saying it was fake wouldn't always cause this. It's because they're not evidence based, someone could still think the religion was real. Because this list is entirely based on belief and all the people who believe them assert they are true."
"You can see a clear progression of evolution in fossils. The fact these fossils are millions and sometimes billions of years old does not matter. In fact, they have to be that old because evolution in animals or plants doesn't happen overnight. You are just refuting science because it doesn't suit your agenda."
"> I am not saying anything

Oh then I don’t know why you think I should talk to you if you’re not saying anything 

I don’t need to prove something that’s self-evident, if you have a problem with my claim then you’re indirectly claiming the inverse is true (and denying this just eliminates any potential you had to be arguing in good faith, if you won’t even stand by the clear-cut logical implications of what you’re saying), so that would place the burden of proof on you as the one who is making the positive claim that certain things have always existed"
Yes! Everything!
">But also, Laprohaig ftw

I can see you're a man (or woman) with good taste"
"Thank you, it has. I genuinely appreciate you taking the time to write that. You’ve given me some things to think about."
"I agree with you entirely, actually. None of what I said MEANS there is a (super)natural cause. In my view those causes would just be natural, not super, is all I’d change. And there is certainly no evidence either way. This is why I don’t believe it, but I also don’t believe it’s impossible. If I believed either way, I’d have faith in one of those positions.   
I don’t.  
I, like all thinkers, am still taking shots in the dark at creation and consciousness."
"No issues, it’s their life."
"No I can't, because it was billions years ago. That is why it matters how old fossils are. How do you know its 100% true if you have never seen it yourself in real life? Or have you seen changes of kinds by yourself(I am talking about monkey to human, dinosaurs into birds) ? What did bacteria become? New type of bacteria? Dont give me crap about that. It's not change of kinds."
"> I don’t need to prove something that’s self-evident

If it is self evident, you should be able to easily demonstrate it."
How is it self-evident?
So god signed off on the creation of the bomb and the ensuing mass destruction of innocent life? Hard pass on that psychopath.

Why? Shouldn't this data be free to everyone?

But no, probably not a pattern."
As if I needed more evidence that the CDC has become highly politicized.
"Once again the United States government can't help itself in treating Native Americans the equivalent of 2nd class citizens.

Hopefully that day will come when these stories will only be read of in history books.  Not in the daily newspaper or in the hourly news."
Trump hates Native Americans.
They need to release the data and explain why these citizens are being victimized for seemingly no reason
YOU TOOK THEIR LAND
America is a shit hole
That’s a pandemic.
[removed]
My conservative family members aren't very trusting of scientific organizations. News like this just reinforces that belief.    At this point it seems like the CDC is trying to make themselves appear untrustworthy.
I teach at a Choctaw Tribal school. The virus is running rampant on the reservation; one of our students lost BOTH of his parents.  A white preacher stopped by and told me that we didn't need to wear masks because the government is hyping the situation to take away our rights. I told him that the Native Americans have inside information that he clearly doesn't know about.
"I always like to click on shit like this, minimize the first couple comments, and see the big ""not quite tldr"" post from the saint that breaks it down for everyone in a way we can understand. I don't see it here though.. I found this on google [https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/us-judge-denies-tribes-bid-halt-virus-relief-71212137](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/us-judge-denies-tribes-bid-halt-virus-relief-71212137)

""U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta heard more than three hours of arguments  in the case he characterized as challenging. He is deciding whether  Alaska Native corporations, which are unique to the state, can receive a  share of $8 billion in funding that Congress approved in March.

Numerous Native American tribes that sued the U.S. Treasury Department, which is tasked with doling out the money, say no.

Mehta earlier ruled to limit distribution to tribal governments while he took on the eligibility question.

The Treasury Department has sent $4.8 billion in payments to tribal  governments based on federal population data population and has said it  will start distributing the rest no later than Monday — well past the  deadline set by Congress.

Attorneys in the hearing Friday picked apart the language included in  the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act and dissected the  history of a federal law that gave tribes the ability to deliver  services like health care, policing and housing to tribal members  through federal contracts.

Attorneys representing the tribes said Congress intended the virus  relief money to go to the 574 tribes that have a political relationship  with the federal government. Because the corporations are not the recognized bodies of government for any tribe, they don't qualify, they argued.

“They are not in any scenario able to compete with tribal governments for finite resources,” said Natalie Landreth.""

"To be clear, she’s like 80?"
"Gosh you guys should see how the government has treated (or lack of even touching with a 50 ft pole) the natives on regular issues for decades before. This isn't new, this silencing of native issues"
CDC is withholding information and lying to the rest of us too.
How is America even real.
"Just a shot in the dark: But they were probably denied due to most Tribes living on the 'Indian Reservation' which in their own rights are sovereign nations much like Puerto Rico. They have their own laws ( under the federal government of course ), own educational programs and are largely disconnected from any and all benefits that states get from the Federal government. These people have an unemployment rate thats like 48% or some shit and are really only taken care of by the village elders and some basic government assistance like bags of rice / basic foods. So even though they are in our country they are treated much like the Puerto Ricans. 

Now is that fair for them? No. Have local state governments offered to help the situation? Partially. Do the village leaders do anything to help their people? From the outside, no not really. 

From Arizona btw."
"Wow, shame on them!"
nice
Yes.
"Not if you had your homeland invaded by foreigners who just so happened to slaughter your people, apparently."
CDC: Well yes... but actually no.
"Unpopular opinion: no. (but yes, depending on what you mean by ""this data"")

There is a whole lot to this. If you read the article, you will see that the requests that have been rejected vary and the reason for the rejection is privacy. Why would privacy be an issue?

Well, despite the strange and often strained nature of the relationship, technically, tribal leadership lands in the gray area between a fully sovereign power and an American protectorate. This might sound like a distinction without difference, but it's not. US law restricts the dissemination of personally identifying health-related information outside of the entity that collected it except within narrowly defined parameters. Because the public health apparatus of a tribal government is technically not part of the CDC or its state counterparts that have clearly defined information-sharing channels within the law, there is no legal way for the CDC to share this information.

They can share the high-level data that is not personally identifying, and they do (that data is made available via the CDC data website) but this is woefully insufficient for contact tracing.

Thing is, contact tracing data is shared with the CDC under the express understanding that it is extremely sensitive data (who, specifically, an infected person has had contact with) so at the very least, contact tracing data SHOULD NOT be shared unless we have a useful way to anonymize that data without making it worthless, and the US has no such system in place. Putting it in place now would wipe the slate clean and no old data could work with the new, anonymized data, so that would not help the tribal leadership in the short term.

We should be sharing all non-PII data that we can, and I believe that we are. It's true that this puts the tribes in a bad spot. At best they could share THEIR data with the CDC and the CDC could provide advisory information back on specific cases, but even that would be a regulatory nightmare and the tribes probably would not trust the CDC with the data."
Came here to say exactly this
"Yes, but not if you're part of an oppressed group of brown people that British people genocided to almost extinction when they invaded their country"
It's genocide with extra steps is what it is.
"As an American, I’m sorry.  To just everyone."
They are technically a sovereign nation outside the United States.
Because brown.
"If they want to be treated like a sovereign nation, then they should pay just like any other nation."
What a profound observation
"For real, that story and this one... is there something I’m missing? These are so fucking horrific, is there any remotely plausible reasonable excuse for this behavior at all?

Or is it really just sickening levels of bigotry and apathy and incompetence?"
"This also was done in Canada to one of our remote native communities.

"From what I read somewhere (may not be true) they did send medical supplies, but unfortunately it’s a fact of life that people would die from it, and so body bags are necessary. They were included with other supplies, the body bags weren’t the only supplies sent. 

I don’t know if this is true, but it’s roughly what I read somewhere else about this."
"If I remember correctly, it was a delivery mixup or something along those lines....thats what they said when asked about it....  

Do I believe them?  Not as far as I can throw Donald Trump's hairpiece in a a hurricane.

Hopefully that day doesn't come as a result of all the Native American's being killed though :/
Let morning shine.
Does it count as xenophobia if they were there first?
Trump hates everyone who can't do something for him.
"""Everyone"" hates native Americans.  They're low on the totem pole,  pun intended,  when it comes to minorities. Speaking from experience as a Canadian, there's a lot more stigma attached to racism of literally any other race.  It'll be a long while before that goes away."
What makes you think Trump had anything at all to do with this decision?
"Trump hates all people. He loves their money and free labor, though"

Yes.
They could have shared.  It was inevitable we were going to spread across this continent.  We really could have coexisted.  Read your history books.  They also never tried to negotiate a border or territory and by being so independent from each other they would have still been warring if they were left alone.

So tribes should be reclassified to fall under the exception. Should only take about 20 years.
"It’s heartening and disheartening to see a well thought-out, considerate comment like this, and to know that the information is probably not simplistic or catchy enough to make it far in the thread. Complex issues often require complex solutions, but between those two steps is the willingness for enough people to even recognize complexity.

"This needs to be higher. I’m sure it isn’t as cut and dry as “help us”. “No”. Sharing data of this nature is probably very difficult, and I would bet there are people within the CDC working on solutions for the best way to fulfill the need of the request. I would hope the answer is more like “no, but...” and they are trying to figure it out."
"Are tribes included in those data? It must bludge the line a little if the data include tribes population, no?"
Sounds like a well explained systemic racism to me.
"Nothing new for the Native community. They were sterilizing Native women up through the 70's. If my grandmother had gone to the wrong Doctor, I wouldn't exist."
"I guess so, I feel like it really cannot be this crazy, but I haven’t found anything would at least make the responses understandable"
"No.

Yes."
"It seems this pandemic has made some of you realize the truth about governments: they’re incompetent and can’t run anything. 


It’s why a majority of Americans scoff at far-left ideas to have the government run even more things and why such ideas never have enough support to be implemented."
"No worries, I use [RES](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) so it's easy to format on here. Thank you for sharing... I didn't know about this other story."
After a pattern of abuse from the government (see other replies to my comment) this is a lot less likely.

The CDC wasn't there first.
"Let’s not kid ourselves—he hates everyone who *isn’t him*. 

He believes he’s the smartest, fittest, most amazing person who has ever existed in the history of the universe. 

He is also deeply insecure because he is afraid deep down that the above sentence could possibly be untrue. Thus, he also sees every other human being as a threat to his potential status as Greatest Human Being of all Time."

His long standing grudge against Native Americans.
"They have admittedly dropped the ball multiple times though, whether it's testing or saying that masks don't work.

That said, they are still a much better resource than youtubers or fb or whatever.  Don't listen to a proctologist or whomever who hasn't seen a covid patient first hand."
That’s exactly the point.
"If I walked into your house raped and killed your wife, took your children away from you, and made you my slave would you be willing to share your house with me? Read your history books. This isn’t about sharing. The white people that came to America viewed Native Americans as no more than beasts."
"Care to cite something other than ""read your history books""?"
"We tried to co exist, asshole. It was never enough for you. You find any valuable resources on our territory and broke treaties to get it."
"Wow the unbelievable privilege to even say this, ass"
"*""They could have shared""*

LOL"
They shouldn't have had to do any of that! Holy shit. This is their home and they shouldn't have had to share any of it.
lol you gotta be joking? Why was it inevitable that „we“ were going to spread across this continent? And why should they have to share it in the first place? So if you own some property you would share it with everyone demanding for it? Because they inevitable spread across this property. Like you know... mexicans?
Shit then it looks like the Natives have it much worse then. Really don't know why this was DV so much
they knew what they were doing
Us Americans know firsthand how that story goes.

Nope my mom got sterilized after my birth TX ‘84
That's just in the US. They're still sterilizing women in Canada today.
"Well, there's the history of how we've been treating native Americans for every single day of this country's existence, plus a couple hundred years.

That might offer a clue."
"When one side chronically defunds everything in government and does their best to ensure it doesn't work, yeah, it doesn't fucking work. Shocker."
"Government certainly works for several countries in some respects (like healthcare). There's no reason why America would be different except for people in power purposefully sabotaging the government or massive unregulated greed.

One government being incompetent does not indicate that all of them are."
Us electing incompetent officials who don’t have our best interests in mind certainly doesn’t help.
Yet the world keeps on turning. It's almost like who's in charge matters when it comes to the government making a response!

Thank you.
Fauci is the talking bobble head. The fact that a man can stand up there and say wear homemade masks that is medically trained is a joke.
They mean the tribes. They were here first.
He knows his failings.  He fears most being seen through for what he really is.
Nope
It comes off like you’re saying the indigenous people don’t deserve to have access to the data. You also lump all tribes in with the anecdotal observation you’ve made about a local tribe.
It'd be funny though

CHAD
"USA doesn't include the area of Alaska, like it's disputed territory or something?"
I can't believe that Chad is bigger than my country
"Moving goods around Chile seems like a nightmare.  How long would a round trip take, say you live in the northern end and need to drive to the southern border to buy some sea bass, and drive home?"
"this was totally made by a russian, crimea is russian and south ossetia as well as abkhazia are recognised haha."
Finally a cool guide
Isn't this the same designer that created the Optimus Keyboard?
FUCK YEAH AUSTRALIA IS ONE OF THE BIG BOIS
"Jesus... Brazil is bigger than the US? 

Man, fuck, sommehow that reminds how much potential it has."
Yes. That's the actual point of karma
TIL Antarctica has a flag. And I love it. It's literally a [selfie of Antarctica.](https://www.flagsonline.it/antarctica)
"The Vatican is only half a square KM?

That doesn’t seem right, I’ve walked around it and it seems much larger than that. St. Peter’s Basicila and Square are feel larger than that and they don’t comprise the whole country."
Beautiful work there by the authors! Hats off
"So if you count water/lakes, Canada is actually the second largest country in the world, which is the stat they taught us Canadians in school"
Sealand Gang!
lmao i like how they have alaska sperate as if its a country
Shouldn't it have been so dull without her.
"I'd be interested in seeing the actual land masses, i.e. the continents and various islands.  Separating out political territories is really less interesting.

And, just for the record, because these land masses originally sit on a sphere, they *are* distorted by laying them flat."
I had zero clue Antarctica was so damn big
Very cool! I love it where can I get a poster if it?
Nice job fitting Chile.

"Wow!  Kazakhstan is 10th largest? 

And here I thought while watching Borat for the first time that Kazakhstan was a made-up country for the movie. 

I put 100% of the blame on my high school social studies teachers and not the lazy teenager I used to be."
Well there are some errors but it's still cool
No one’s a major accomplishment!
The perfect map! Dont try and use it to get around though...
Finally now I can die in peace

"In the light of some relatively recent events, I’m afraid you should reconsider the size of Ukraine and Russia."
"Of course for the U.S. this left out 2 states because the number listed is close to the area of the contiguous states. One of these, Alaska, is **very** big. Without those states it would be fifth largest and with those it would be third. See https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States"

And I knew Africa was big but I didn't know it was proportionally equal to Asia."
"About half of the US (in large air quotes) **”** easily habitable **”** The other half is desert and very dry land, the dry land is habitable with some work . For Australia 3 quarts of it is desert and in the remaining easy habitable quarter half of that is tropical and not pleasant to be in, a quarter is dry land with nary any rain and the final bit is actually habitable. Australian is a nation of city states"
Lol at The Netherlands.
Is Alaska included but just not visually represented?
Nice. I was searching for something like that.
Why have I always been taught Canada was the biggest when it’s 3rd (Antarctica barely counts as a country)
It's even got Sealand on it. That's adorable. I love it.
Countess of Sealand here. Thanks for including us! Long live His Royal Highness Prince Michael! E mare libertas!
God damn it sealand
Chile the country looks like what comes out my ass when I have too many.
i never realized that Ivory Coast was bigger than Poland !
Sealand?
Canada is 4th? Wat
Now I need someone to take all these and put them together like a puzzle so that we get and accurate map
"you mo ther fker,why i didnt see taiwan island with china land"
australia is just upside down america. never noticed until they were side by side.

Russia is a transcontinental country. Why do they have most of Russia listed as part of Europe at the bottom? Russia is mostly in Asia.
Map of India is incorrect
this just looks like an jigsaw puzzle I don't want to do
Yeah but I wish they showed them at their actual size so I could get a proper feel for how big they are
Chad is surprisingly large.
"I will give you some data from Argentina, traveling from La Quiaca (north) to Ushuaia (south)

* The Estimated Driving  Distance from  La Quiaca Argentina to Ushuaia Argentina  2693.11 miles or 4336.73 km 
* The Estimated Driving  Time from  La Quiaca Argentina to Ushuaia Argentina  is  55 hours, 53 minutes, 21 seconds"
"I have spent a lot of time in Argentina, a lot of it driving or on buses, so I have a very personal feeling for its size and actually it makes for a fascinating thing in the other direction: comparing the big countries to it, I see how huge they are. I always knew that China is big, but just seeing that Argentina almoat fits there north-south makes me go wow."
"I think that's because on world planisphere they are way closer to the equator than North countries, they are less South than Canada, USA or China are North and so they appear smaller than these (or should I say these appear bigger than Brazil and Argentina). There are way more land North of the Equator than South of it."
"Chile's size (thus coast) was a lot smaller. After the [war of the pacific](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Pacific), Chile left Bolivia landlocked and took a sizable chuck of southern Peru, making Chile the long country that is today."
"To be fair, this map doesn't look straight in its proportions... Brazil don't look like almost 4 times Argentina.
And I was taught un school that Brazil was the fifth biggest country in the world."
I'm from Chile and a coast lover can confirm
Ahahaha I had the exact same thought. :)

...and you have the dryest desert at the north and glaciers to the south. I love my country.
Netflix & chile
Wiki says 27 people live there.
I got my lordship right next to me lmao
I’m so happy Sealand made it onto the chart
Also Georgia is not full
"There are so many things wrong with this map. Crimean dispute, separatists of Georgia and Cyprus shown on the map, but plenty of other separatists ignored. Why you gotta show Georgia and Cyprus chopped up, but Azerbaijan full, like nothing's happening there? Author is a hypocrite"
They often work for the government (like city branding and maps) so only a state sanctioned map is allowed. Half joking.
There is no discussion. Crimea is a part of Ukraine.
Growing up I was always told Canada was second largest behind Russia.
Canada has huge lakes that are probably not counted as part of the landmass.
"I was wondering the same. If you have time, read about the methods they used. It's a very interesting approach."
"If you count water area. But the Hudson’s Bay is otherwise a giant ass hole in our land area. 

Still, we got one big ass country and I love it. I’ve driven across it a few time’s and it’s been an amazing experience each time."
It’s Russian propaganda.  Go figure.
"US too, but he forgot Alaska"
To piss off Texas.
"Tasmania is also not shown separate from mainland Australia, yet Hawaii is from the rest of USA"
This bothered me. I guess because it is a discrete exclave?
To demote it from 4th place to 6th
Because it makes the United States appear smaller
Hawaii too
Maybe because they are too far away to  display correctly on the map?
"Because it’s a map of all land masses, not countries."
Usa is shown 9 times on this map i guess whoever made the map was murican.
I was going to ask why Alaska and Hawaii weren’t included. It puts the US further down the list.
Apparently to make Russia appear larger by comparison than it is.
Same reason French Guyana is separated from France.
"Yeah, but no Texas. If one, I wanted both. 

But also, Pakistan is a T Rex. Japan and Vietnam are dragons."
Also Austria from Germany! /s
guessing that it doesn't include exclaves.  Kaliningrad isn't shown either.
That's the exact problem of [the map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection).
I'm from New Zealand and I would've thought it was larger than Madagascar til I saw this.

"Only differences that don't make much sense to me are the different island groups of Kiribati (Line, Gilbert and Phoenix) and the distinction between West and East Malaysia since Indonesia doesn't have these distintions even though it has many islands."
They put the DR there and straight up just forgot Haiti
We so biiiiig
"Yeah can't figure why that is.  Wikipedia also shows different numbers for landmass excluding the water.    


Interesting fact: The CIA factbook uses the extra water area as a way of propaganda to make the US come as 3rd biggest country and makes China the 4th. Somehow in their list they include all the water area for the US but don' t use this method for any other country. It's a childish way to make US look bigger and China smaller, it's not about size, but what you do with it...."
Canada has 60% of the worlds fresh water supply with over 2 million lakes and streams. That’s a lot of water you can subtract from the landmass in the way this was counted.
Please where is the link for an actual had image to print it as a poster
It's a nice work but the author is apparently Russian nationalist so any decent person can't upvote this
The Kashmir part.
Ireland also usually identifies itself as the whole island too.
"Yeah wtf! Oh right, this is more Russian propaganda..."
"Because it's a map that reflects actual reality on the ground not legal recognition.

If Georgia was shown including Abkhazia then you'd also have to show China with Taiwan, and India with all of Kashmir,  etc. etc. etc."
He has done for Cyprus as well by separating the north occupied areas and the south... my guess is he didn't take into account where legally a landmass belong and decided to include it as part of a country that has the actual control over the area
"Oh, i see now, author is from Russia)"
"Canada is bigger if you go by total area (in Canada’s case, including water territory)."
No you weren’t. It’s seems the person who made this didn’t count lakes and the like so that wasn’t added into the land mass.
This is based on landmass only and Canada has a metric fuckton of lakes and inland water.
It's a flag of the [Antarctic Treaty Secretariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty_System).
Can you elaborate on what is inaccurate?
It's hard to detect sarcasm on the internet but i'll assume this is it
"Africa is there. But broken up into its separate countries. 

Same with all of the other continents."
"Also Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria shouldn't be on the map."
And America is “officially” listed without Alaska making it “officially” in a lower place... strange
"This is land mass, not total area."
I would like the populations on this image and another image where they're ordered by population size but still have the size of the land to proportion.
"Fourth raw, first on the left."
Well deforestation has happened on a much larger scale than that. It overlaps with urban area's but I don' t really get how its measured because it doesn't seem to match with the intensity of urban areas in other countries like China or India that have much larger cities.
"it isn't and never really was, but it's a good meme"
"without looking it up, I'm guessing the difference depends on whether you include Ngorno-Karabakh


as a bunch of angry Georgians & Indians have pointed out higher up in this comment chain, this map seems to be on de facto not de jure territory"
"Canada has a lot of water territory that’s not counted in this map. US has Alaska, which is counted separately in this map."
The Northern Ireland U.K. bit is lumped in with the rest of the U.K.
Alaska is in its own separate bit from the rest of the USA on this map.
Water area isn’t counted
"Tibet, like Taiwan and Hong Kong is not a part of China"

Don’t be.

ive done the drive from San Carlos de Bariloche to El Chalten in one of those tour buses. It took like 40 hours. The bus also broke down for 6 of those.
"Put into US perspective, that’s about 1.3 times the distance from Chicago to Los Angeles (Route 66). 

Google tells me it’d only take about 39 hours. I assume that’s due to the US highway system."
"It also helps that they have very few affordable domestic flights, long-distance buses is a very entrenched industry and actually have a lot of impact on government regulation of travel."
"Right. Most world maps we see use the [Mercator projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection), which makes land masses appear comparatively bigger the further away from the equator they are. That's why we tend to overestimate the size of North America and Europe and underestimate Africa and South America."
Brazil is only 3x the area of Argentina and this map separates Alaska from the rest of USA. Combined the US is bigger than Brazil but the contiguous part is smaller.
"Brazil is only the fifth because of Alaska, if the US didn't own Alaska it would be the fifth, and I think the map is not showing how many countries can fit in one, it's a size comparison, like a Top 10."

Just depends on [how you measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area#Countries_and_dependencies_by_area). Canada has 3X the inland water are of China.
Second largest in total area. Third in land area. Just depends on the measurements. This graph is based on just the land area.
It is.
I was too. This map is fucking great. Good job to the maker.
"At first I thought they excluded Hudson‘s Bay... but [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Canada) says Canada’s area is 9.98 million square km, 91.08% is land mass.  That would be 9.1 million sq km, not the 8.9 million shown. But China, at 9.6 million is 98% land mass, or 9.3 million square km.  Either way, [these figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area) are different from the numbers in the Lebedev map. Very interesting, nevertheless."
They may be ranking by [Land Area](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.TOTL.K2?most_recent_value_desc=true) as opposed to total area?
I know there is some disputed territory between China and neighboring countries. It's quite possible that this graphic includes them as part of China
"This is incorrect. Hudson’s bay is never counted as part of Canada for area calculations. Instead, what makes Canada smaller than China on this list is the fact that they didn’t count our inland waters - the Great Lakes, lake Winnipeg, great slave and great bear, Athabasca, and then the literally millions of littler lakes. Canada has so much inland water that if you could put it all together in one big lake, it would be bigger than France.

However, I’ve never understood excluding lakes from calculations like this. We use those lakes for fishing, recreation, travel and transportation, etc. they are as much a part of the county as the land is."
Bro I was looking for Texas :/
This would likely be the reason. Alaska is huge enough to be separated.
"I'm not even American but I agree, this map certainly seems to have some sort of agenda. Not much consistency at all."
why Britain and NI together then
"If that was truly the case, it would be a map of continents.

Country borders are human constructs."
it's clearly divided up into countries though. breaking up land masses to separate the countries out...and including separate land masses to constitute whole countries.
No. They're a Russian. This is to demote USA
*Russian ?
"The person was Russian, and it’s Russian propaganda.  Literally.  It was created by a major Russian design firm that is very closely tied to Putin.  The credited author is a Russian nationalist who has made pro-Putin propaganda in the past."
"9 times? I only saw a lot Alaska, which ones did I miss?"
Wow. Compare Greenland and the continental USA on a Mercator projection and then compare them on the OP image. Wow.
"Where are your data from? Sweden's area is 450,295 sqkm according to Wikipedia and I've always been taught that my country is around 450,000 sqkm. What gives the 40,000 sqkm of difference?"
shutup man nestle might hear you
"Exactly. The ""no distortions"" bit is BS. But it's a very good size comparison."
"It's impossible to project the whole surface of a sphere onto a 2D surface because you are having to stretch radial geometries into a linear graph however taking a section of a sphere and comparing it with another section of a sphere both land masses will be distorted in the same manner making size comparison possible. It's not perfect obviously, but a hell of a lot better than the Mercator projection."
"I agree, this does not seem possible."

Canada has more fresh water than the rest of the world combined 60% of the worlds fresh water in fact.
"Interesting, so it means that Canada is bigger if you count just its area of the world but smaller if you count just the landmass!"
"Yeah they are only counting land area despite saying total area. We have the most water by far, our lakes are bigger than france. The bay doesnt get counted regardless, only wholly surrounded water. Otherwise canada would add another million ks"
"I wanna like this, but they way they did the countries doesn’t make sense. Alaska and Hawaii are separate from the US, which is ok if this was consistent. Ireland is split between two countries and places like Indonesia are shown as one. Also the data doesn’t seem to match up, which is weird because its not like they’re changing often"
Then why not separate all the Indonesian islands?
And Indonesia all counted as one
It's not a competition
I believe it’s actually 14 times. There are a lot of small US islands at the bottom.

Canada’s additional area that makes it bigger than China is its water area between all its islands. If you don’t include water then China is bigger.

"We don't have colonies, and our islands are included in the picture. If you only count land area though, ie not any area covered by lakes or rivers or such, then Sweden is 407000 km\^2. That could be the discrepancy. We have a lot of lakes.

I wonder if this is made consistently with all other countries as well."
was that sarcasm or did you not get it? /s
Yeah. Easily visible in this chart
"You're right, Quebec has the one level down lake/island/lake, my bad"
"It matches for Finland, but I doubt it's taken into account for every country."
The title of the picture in the picture itself specifically says land area so the point at least is that it's excluding lakes and such. How accurately it's done is a different question though.
"Yes, but if the point is to compare sizes, you'd assume it's excluding seas, not excluding inland waters."

Thanks for the tip tip
I grew up on a farm and I always learned to husk corn slightly but enough you you can see around the top and down the sides some. You could check for worms/mold and it also helps save you from buying corncobs that don’t have well-formed kernels all over.

"Used to work at a corn packing farm, I remember there used to be a larvae like thing (wasp maybe?) at the top, so as it went through the saw to cut the top off, it would squish the grub. Nice big green stain.. I avoid these ones every time I go shopping for some."
Not to be confused with [rotten corn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81nga_pirau) which is actually quite tasty
"I’m only saying this because my boyfriend is from New Zealand and he’s telling that to me.

Any Maori People/people who know more about NZ History than me and Wikipedia that want to correct me please do. I am but a simple Australian.

Edit: fixed it so I didn’t sound like a self righteous idiot"
I work in a produce department. Corn turns red when it’s been sitting around for a while. Usually the husk has wilted by that point so its easy to assume without checking.
They might be selling it on special for people to feed to animals. My pigs/chickens/rabbits don’t care how sour it is
Never seen this in all my days of buying roadside sweetcorn. But I'm from the midwest near Chicago so I'm guessing our standards for corn are higher than most.
ORDER CORN
It's the same with sour milk. Don't drink it because it will taste like shit.
Corn Smut
Thanks this helps as i was just about to go shopping
"I used to work at a small grocery store. The owner would buy all of his produce on deal from Eastern Market in Detroit. That market is excellent but he would buy the older stuff that the vendors were trying to unload before it became unsellable. I’ve seen plenty of colored mold in corn. He would have us cut off the moldy ends and package it in plastic wrap and styrofoam trays. It was best when he wasn’t there cuz we would throw a lot of it away. When he was there, which was most of the time, we had garbage and what we called “discrete garbage”.  I quit after a year. I couldn’t stand to be a part of how he ran his business.

It used to be an excellent butcher shop with high quality produce. Now neither of those are high quality. My family had been longtime customers but they don’t shop there anymore."
I did not know this. Thank you!
Same with bananas
"i husked a lot of corn yesterday, what a coincidence"
"I saw this for the first time in my life the other day - one one cob, the tip was pinkish and crumbly. And sure enough that cob did have a sour note to it."
"Well, this explains why my burrito bowls were absolutely horrible last week. 

Been solely buying produce online and got 8 ears of corn pre-husked with the ends chopped off and pink. 

Cut off the pink parts and roasted it with a lot of spice but ya- it was sour as heck."
That's amazing. I was just about to go to the store to get some corn.
Same with cream cheese the mold on that is a light pink
"Not to be confused with pink silk on corn [like this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6f/1f/b6/6f1fb68f392e62bb238f169734d5c3b9.jpg). Pink silk is completely fine and common in some varieties. It should turn mostly brown by the time it's ready to harvest, but if you're growing corn and see pink, don't worry at all."
Could it be huitlacoche? A delicacy in mexico!
"Yeah, I was cornfused about the way you’re spelling mold, but then I realized that people live in places other than the good ol’ U.S. of A, too."
Oh don’t sound too back
"What’s not snow.
It looks like mould."
People act like I don kno nobodeh!
I’m in Cali brah fresh produce on the reg. Kill that noise
It really doesn’t hold oil.
The ends of the can or the end of the inside of the can? I've never bought corn.
"I wonder, is that the same mold that is considered a delicacy in some countries? In Mexico, it is called smut. I ate smut tacos, wherein the corn mold is used instead of meat for the taco filling. It was delicious! Tastes like savory, slightly burnt popcorn."
> Don’t just leave well enough alone.
I’ve seen this before but typically the person is stuck in window or under a bed and their stepson has to help them out.
So if it isn't on sale its ok?
Anything not normal is special lol. And runs a profit for being different

Can they be used to make corn bread like how one uses banana to make banana bread
"Could be something like Huitlacoche, which is a delicacy. 


Huitlacoche, is considered a perfect food that provides all the essentials to support life on its own."
>Most parents aren’t enough sometimes

Ha
"Directions confusing, dick got caught in ceiling fan."
Nice
Great tip! Most corn stands and even grocery stores I’ve been to will let you fully or partially husk the corn to check it out!
"I grew up and still live and work on a farm. We regularly get people partially husking dozens of ears that are completely fine but ""not quite perfect"" (this entire town consists of the most entitled Karens you can imagine) and leaving them on the table so no one else will buy them and it all goes to waste. Please don't do this. You can just feel through the leaves with your fingers to see how full it is and we've never once had mold."
"What’s funny is my gf and I bought corn the other day and she scoffed at me and is like why are you doing that. So I said what and she just grabs an ear of corn and puts in the cart without even looking at it. 

I’m like you need to make sure the corn is good it could be rotten or something. 

Also I grew up on a farm in Indiana. The place for corn."
No.
I’ve never noticed it before today but apparently it’s quite common. Mainly with corn that’s been cut because that’s where the mould gets in.
I’ve only seen it when they are pre-husked and packed. They get all slimy and the ends turn pink.
No.
European corn borer
""" I wonder if it is negative"
Or [huitlacoche](https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/huitlacoche-corn-mexico)
A beautiful example of the difference between fermenting (Rotten Corn) and rotting (OPs pink corn)
"Corn isn’t native to New Zealand, rotten corn probably only existed after the English came to the country."
Curious why you need to know about NZ to see mould on corn?
"What a coincidence, I was in Coles today and saw some prepackaged corn with pink mould on the cut ends. Guess you did the same?"
"i was wondering where you get red/pink spots. in the us, corn mold looks like typical black mold."
I live in the middle of the city so I am pretty sure they’re selling it for human consumption.
Well my pigs/chickens/rabbits despise sour corn and always complain to the manager.
"Farm fresh corn!

Not sure anyone has seen that movie but I’m sure you’re getting the good stuff."
"The same reason why I don't eat meat which has maggots in it! 

Too much protein for my liking!"
It’s the same with rotten meat. Don’t eat it because it will taste like shit.
Don't kink shame.
"Ah of course, she’ll go shopping again"
No problem! Just making sure we’re al enjoying good corn
Wait is that red wax they put on the end of them a conspiracy or do you mean the actual fruit inside?
The mould wars continue
You are better than most people on reddit
UWOTM8?
People outside Cali might need to know this stuff bro-dawg
If you’re buying canned corn I can’t help you. I don’t think anyone can.
I think someone else in this thread mentioned that hut they said the mould was blue?
I feel like your referencing something I don’t know about
"As I’ve explained before to another American, in Australia we spell it “mould”"
"Hey you’re the one guy that didn’t need this, congrats"
"You know if mould is in something it’s not just in the area you can see right? Same for mouldy bread.

Just cutting off the bit with the mould doesn’t get rid of the mould in the thing you’re eating."
I am australian and Mold is the American spelling
Well it’s pink now if not purple.
"I caught a falling knife"""
Wow how long did it take you to think of that one
Very original
"I’ve been to one or two places that stopped people from husking the corn at all. I refused to buy corn from them. “No, you may not check to see if the corn is fresh, ready to eat, or even edible.” No thanks."
I don’t do full husking now because I live in the city and they don’t have bins near the corn to get rid of the husks but full husk is definitely ideal. My method works most of the time but if there are issues with the bottom you won’t see them unless you get lucky.
"At my local grocery store they aren't allowing in-store husking due to the virus, I guess."
Right? Almost 40 years on this earth and I've never seen moldy corn sold.
Do people make a big deal about a worm on the end? The few ears I've had with worms I just chop the end off an inch or so further down. Corn is also $2.50/dozen here so I would have no problem just throwing away a few.
Not only that but the best way to cook corn is inside the husk on the grill. I’ve never needed to husk the corn to tell if it was right- you can tell by the feel and the weight. And all the corn by me comes from local farms- I’ve never gotten a moldy piece of corn in 30 years of buying it.
"Could you finish husking those ears, package them up, and sell them in groups of four or so like grocery stores do?"
"What’s worse than biting into an apple and finding a worm? 
.
.
.
.
Biting into an apple and finding half a worm."
"Basically any colour at the top of the corn, ignore it :) bergh."
"I read a story awhile back about farmers throwing this fungus corn out before they realized it was huitlacoche, a delicious corn mushroom. Basically, it was gold and they were tossing it out, thinking their crops were bad."
The names really clear things up huh?
Spreading our rot about the world...
"Someone made a comment about “mouldy corn”’and linked it to an article about it being a Maori dish” I can’t find it now but I accidentally didn’t reply directly to it so I get this comment seems kinda random.

Edit: punctuation"
"IGA For me, corn was on special, guess I know why now."
We get that special Southern Hemisphere mould
Damn pigs always complaining about their food then breaking out
"Where I live I'm surrounded by amazing sweet corn, but there is one specific farm that has THE BEST sweet corn I've ever had. Granted, they are a family friend, but if we could get that quality from our hometown, we would just stick local, but the 20 minute drive is *so* worth it."
I want to hear more about the New Zealand red banana conspiracy theory
"I just lost 2 grow bags and 3 jars to fusarium, so I’m on the front lines."
"Likewise, and thanks for the tip! I’ll definitely be on the lookout next time I go pick up some corn from the local farms."
"I've. Never. Bought. Corn.


I'm 15.


I don't buy shit."
"Ah that might be correct. This was 10 years ago so I am likely misremembering.

Edit: just realized in my memory the mold was black but I didn’t even say that in my OP."
"It was rather sarcastic of me, but this sub is filled full of seemingly useless information."
It's mold. Mould is something completely different.
Yeah idgaf.
But then again I don’t know your heritage so maybe it always looked like that.
That’s what sh-
"Well don't buy it now, it will taste really sour."
And probably tastes sour.
I was scolded by a worker at a grocery store once for partially husking to check the corn. He told me that they were fine because he just put them out. There was a bin there for husking so I was just confused. I’ve always partially or fully husked my corn at the grocery store.
"Serious question- how do you cook corn then? Hands down the best way I’ve found to cook corn is in the husk. Soak it in water, toss it on the grill and let it steam inside the husk. Concentrates the flavor without watering it down the way boiling does."
Don't touch the avocado!
"Might be a Midwest thing, but they keep a trash can by the corn for people who want to husk it before they buy"
Fully husking corn sucks because the best way to cook corn is by soaking it in water and then putting the entire ear right on the grill. The husk keeps the ear from burning and the husk+water helps distribute the heat without losing flavor.
You gotta protect those vulnerable people that eat corn raw. I know that i just get exposed to more stupid stuff because of the internet but it really does feel like the world is getting dumber by the day.
Almost 50 and I’ve seen plenty of gross corn. Maybe depends on where you live/shop.
Holy smokes! It's 1 for $1 here when it's on sale. I always thought it was the best deal. Damn.
We hand sort every ear at least twice before it gets to the table and I don't think we've ever had a worm but if we did I'm sure we'd be up to our eyes in lawsuits
"Subjective but I agree.

On behalf of small farmers everywhere I thank you for your support. It's getting harder all the time and customers like you really make a difference to us psychologically"
"We do actually do that a lot but 1. It's pretty labor intensive, 2. It introduces a bunch of plastic packaging that will end up in landfills and 3. We haven't been doing that recently because of the virus. You can't exactly Lysol corn that people have dug their fingers through and abandoned.

Edit: Also it's just really inconsiderate given that we have already packaged corn available right next to it, if you *must* know exactly what it looks like before you buy it"
Had that nightmare become a reality in my younger years. Totally fine when in books but way less cool when it happens to you
"It’s fine if you just cut it off though, right?"
It certainly has an interesting flavor
I think outside of Mexico people still throw it out.
"It’s also the Mexican/Aztec dish Huitlacoche or cuitlacoche, but the mold is blue."
Not to get topical but if your country wasn’t dealing with everything you’re dealing with I would LOVE to head over there and get that sweet sweet corn
The red wax thing is australian... do other people not do that?
Nah we just like to get rid of unnecessary vowels. There's zero need for a 'u' in color or favorite or mold.
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mould
You sure pwned him there!
But you did enough to try and correct ok
Did you just assume his heritage?
"I can understand where stores are coming from, as another commenter said I know there are people who are husking or partially husking the corn, then tossing it despite there not *actually* being anything wrong with it. Probably would help some vendors/stores to put up a little sign that shows you how to tell if the corn is good or not. Really I just look for obvious things like mealworms or mold or dried out kernels showing the corn isn’t fresh. I pull the husk down from the top just enough to see the corn, if it’s good, I’ll husk the rest and keep it (unless something nasty pops up elsewhere on the corn, but that’s pretty rare in my experience). If it’s not a “perfect” cob of corn after I’ve husked it, I’m still buying it because that’s not cool to do. No one wants to buy the corn I’ve just manhandled."
"I pull the husk down but leave it attached at the stem end and pull all the little “hairs” off and then pull the husk back up over the corn to grill it. You can tie a bit of twine at the end to keep it together while cooking if you want, but I’ve always found that to be unnecessary."
"Depends. On the grill, like you said. Cooking on the stove, husk it and put in water, when the water boils it’s pretty much done."
My store double checks them at the register for you as well.
"This guy knows what’s up, that’s how I grill it every time"
This sounds like a great technique. You leave the husk untouched and let it soak overnight? How do you tell when they're done with the husk on?
I husk them and then wrap in tin foil. That way I can season the corn.
"I mean, if you handle the same corn that someone picked up then put down... not if you eat it raw."
"It must. Let's try to figure it out, I'm in SoCal and I don't think we grow corn out here. I probably only look/buy when it's in season. Maybe that's why?"
It’s not like they’re going to eat it raw
It's free ~~real-estate~~ protein.
That’s what we’ve always done.
Gotta give a shout out to the originators of corn. Respect where it’s due
It's funny to me that the english term for it is [Corn Smut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_smut)
That's from Corn Smut. Super easy to find and I don't want to touch it.
No in the (mainland) USA our bananas [Look like this](https://i.imgur.com/IiKHYAD.jpg)
"Wait sometimes they ship with plastic wrap over the top nubs, maybe that and red wax both stop water loss?"
"Eh. I eat corn seeds in popcorn, so yes I like corn.


But mostly corn seeds to make popcorn."
"Would, could, and should on the other hand ..."
......no?
"That’s fair. But if I open one up and it has something wrong with it I’d much rather not buy it than buy and get home with my 2 ears of corn that have something wrong (bugs, rot, etc). I had picked up one to check and was scolded. I didn’t check 7 and put them all back before he scolded me."
They allow it in my store and resell the ones that have been opened but still good on a styrofoam plate and plastic wrap.
"If you folks aren't cooking your corn on the grill in it's husk you're missing out on some delicious corn(*this is just one of many ways of making delicious corn). Soak them in water first, much easier to get all the silk off when its been cooked too. Plus I don't have time to husk my corn at the store, I do check it but usually by an extras ear or two since they're like $0.25-0.50 when in season."
"That’s the method Bobby Flay recommends but I’ve tried that a couple of times and it never seals as well as if you just leave it on. The water evaporates a lot more quickly and then you need to watch it a lot more carefully.

Honestly I’ve just never found it necessary to open the husk- the weight and feel of the ear is enough. And if I really feel the need to check I can open just the tip and peak- but I can’t remember the last time I felt the need to do that."
"Doesn’t have to soak overnight- you just need the water to get inside the husk. 30 minutes is usually plenty but an hour or two is also fine.

As for when it’s done- I usually take it off when the husk starts to char slightly- that generally means the water inside has boiled off (otherwise it would keep taking away the heat which would prevent that). Honestly though- you get a feel for it pretty quickly. And the truth is that you have quite a large window of time when it’s done but before it burns- that’s the beauty of leaving the husk on."
"Seattle WA here, sometimes moldy sometimes mealy corn here but not often. I've never heard of fully husking corn at the store. We're allowed to peek a little bit but that's about it. Wouldn't the silk get everywhere?"
It’s in my lineage.
"I’ve looked it up and it’s a specific brand. The red wax tip means it’s grown in the pacific region.

Here’s what they look like so you don’t think I’m [nuts](https://www.google.com/search?q=red+wax+banana&rlz=1CDGOYI_enAU869AU869&hl=en-GB&prmd=isvn&sxsrf=ALeKk021JukVNs1ajntLp7OBjXdnQt_Xrw:1592138925825&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjD_-zYq4HqAhVFeH0KHVuTDBMQ_AUoAXoECA0QAQ&biw=414&bih=724&dpr=2#imgrc=lq47Mudzw8qIJM)

Edit: spelt wax wrong"
I'm gonna have to speak with your manager
"Agreed, no grocer should be asking a customer to buy produce without checking to see if it’s fresh. Regardless of the actual state of the produce, if the grocer is yelling at me for checking if it’s fresh, I’m just gonna assume it’s not and take my business elsewhere."
And it adds such a great flavor!
"We are but kernels in the cob of our ancestors.

I’m indian so there’s probably a rice metaphor I could use but I don’t know the physiology of rice."
OMFG
"Oh that's weird, I thought you were talking about the other side of the banana. I've seen bunches in the store where the stem part they all break off from was wrapped in a little plastic wrap. I just looked it up and apparently it's to slow ripening by preventing these release of ethylene gas."
That's for making a smooth entry when using the banana sexually.
Well I’m brown and my boyfriend is white so if we’re having a convo about dick shades I feel like he’s gonna be on my side.
"Fuck off karen.

You’d think your twat could do at least one thing right.

But here we are, with these little bastard idiots."
Dick Shades was my nom de plume when I wrote erotic noir back in the 70's.
Well if either of your dicks turn purple I think that dick shade means hospital time.
Well if the tip of his is pink or red don’t eat it....
"Hes gonna be in your inside, if dicks are mentioned more than 3 times in 5 mins"
"Well yeah, “checking if it’s fresh” doesn’t mean inserting your finger into the fruit or otherwise being nasty. Most people don’t do that shit though. And where I live, you can’t even enter the store without a mask on, by law."
Noir with a hint of (respectful) interracial sex?

Comment
"Media urges Trump to curb violence against the media, who he has repeatedly described as ""the enemy"".

Good luck with that, I suppose it can't hurt to ask."
In a country all about freedom. You would assume that covered freedom of the press.
After discovering he can have police violently attack people who made fun of him? I'm pretty sure Arpaio and Chauvin are going to head up the national police reform.
"Yet he is making weekly Tweets about the police forces needing to dominate, somehow I don’t think he’ll listen to what they want."
America is a joke and the world is laughing.
They must not be paying attention. Donald Trump absolutely hates journalists. He's been encouraging violence towards journalists since day one.
“We’re All In This Together” ...
This guy is going to burn this country to the ground
"This is the scariest part of all to me. Protests, riots, looting have been done before."
Trump doesn’t care for journalism as it exposes his lies.
"They get attacked because America that’s why.

I feel like reddit should have a sub which archives videos that must be kept for the sake of democracy and the greater good. Some people enjoy little freedom of speech, and the least we can do is to preserve this kind of bravery and let the world know that there were warriors who fought against injustice."
“Thorough investigations” that would be great wouldn’t it.
"Ahh, the old “pissing in the wind” approach."
Barking up the wrong tree. Might have better luck with some other govt agency. Federal justice dept doesn’t care either. You’re going to have to try them in absentia at the ICC and try to pick up individuals if they leave the country.
"This is ridiculous!

Instead of having the US to make China more like the US, now we have the US becoming a lot like China!"
One more thing to arrest him for after he’s out. I can’t wait to watch all the court proceedings and witness his transformation from ‘I’m untouchable’ to broken old man like Harvey Weinstein did. It’s going to be the best show ever.
Our president openly advocates the assaults on journalists.  What's the point?
One assumes that if Trump continues to allow this kinda behavior towards the press they will respond with a 'less than favorable' attitude towards Trump onward. I'd love to see a major investigative journalism blitzkrieg into that fraud's finances.
What about the Al Jazeera journalist imprisoned in Egypt for ~3 1-2 years without a trial?
What explicit mechanisms does POTUS have to stop NYPD or the Minneapolis police from beating up journalists? He has no authority over them.
What press covering US protests? They stopped reporting on the protests as soon as looters stopped smashing their corporate overlord's windows.
Does the President have the power to curb police violence? I haven't seen any of our previous presidents use that authority if they had it.
Why is he covered in blood?
Yeah like that's gonna happen. He will just brush it off like he usually does the big chicken.
"Look here, global press. We’re the home team. You’re the visitors. If they aren’t gonna take it easy on us, y’all can forget about any mercy or grace."
I’m sure he will get right on that
"More violence, you say?"
after going on a rampage
"US Gov will try to sanction them, wouldn't they."
The states are saying he should stay out of their affairs. You either want him to help or you don't. Pick a side. He can't protect journalists in liberal cities. This falls on the mayor and gov of that state.
“........no....” trump
"Feature, not bug."
How about no violence at all?   Just saying
"Let's get this straight, they want Trump to order his AG to investigate police departments for violating the rights of reporters."
"Yeah I think it's pretty telling that it's been the worst assault on the press in America's history, it's fourth estate is under threat, and the president has been silent on the issue."
"It's always cute when foreign nations and organizations think they can reach out to Trump rationally to correct some sort of wrong. He completely ignores his own people, why the fuck would he give a shit about the rest of the world (except Putin, of course)"
Ya it’s called they are showing up to an unorganized angry mob. They were not planned peaceful protests by any definition. So ya sucks but that’s the job.
Why aren't they standing up for Assange? Where are all the protesters against his torture and imprisonment for publishing the war crimes of the US?
"Well if there’s no press, there’s no violence... or proof of it"
"They want him to stop the violence, at the same time calling him literally hitler for wanting to put national guard against the rioters, ending police beutality against media by proxy?"
How much power does the POTUS really have over local cops?
"If they could not shoot people directly with rubber bullets, tear gas peaceful protesters, or be violent thugs that'd be great too...DEFUND THE POLICE!!!"
Journalists and the media have been lying and driving a giant wedge in the western world for decades and most recently since Trump took office. With Trump they’ve gone full insanity with no self reflection. Any respect for their profession has died a thousand deaths and everything they are experiencing is the result of their own malfeasance.
"Being lectured on US civics by people who don't understand the US civics system. How original.

Getting real fucking tired of idiots who think the US president is some kind of Supreme Overlord who can command every aspect of American life."
"American cops are now ""trained"" the same way that American military personnel or private American contractors ""train"" death-squad police forces in places like Bahrain, Iraq, Honduras, Guatemala, Indonesia, or Saudi Arabia."
"So, let me get this straight.  The police which are part of state and local government, they (the media) wants Trump to nationalize them?"
"Fascist is as fascist does.
Trump won’t change a thing, after all it’s what he wants."
"Global press unaware that the police aren't federal employees meaning Trump hase zero authority over their actions.

I'll help get you started with the appropriate chains of command.

Jacob Frey, Mayor of Minneapolis

Tim Waltz, Gov of Minnesota

Bill De blasio, Mayor of NYC

Byron Brown, Mayor of Buffalo, NY

Andrew Cuomo, Gov of New York"
How about the global press urge the US press to stop inciting violence?
The Global press urges...... It's time to get off your collective asses and get in the godamn game. You can't sit and warm the benches any more.
How do they propose he do that ?
"How about no. Most of the media is trash nowadays, picking and choosing in order to stir people up. They aren't reporting the news. They are just swarming paparazzi paid to instill fear and panic. They report before having all the facts because they want you to remember 'you heard it here first!'. I head more about the protests and riots - and there haven't even been any in my town! But where were the reports about the impending housing panic when rent forgiveness ends and they can start booting people out!? Or what about that dang bill that passed this week that pretty much removed trans health protection? Or the possible banning of abortion that has been floating around? Or where people can go if the pandemic has cost them their job, food safety, a house, medicine, health insurance, or even if they are suffering domestic abuse!?

I want unbiased reports with facts. I'm not reading novel, so you don't need to 'fill in' that 'the man was shaking with fear', just tell me what he said. The weather people don't predict that those heavy clouds in winter mean feet of snow, when they know it'll probably only be inches, to make people hoard buy food fearing snowed in. So why should reporters be allowed to put words in the interviewee's mouth?

Besides you know they are shooting pellets and spraying tear gas at these events. Should they be? No. But those are the only ways to clear unhappy crowds I've seen that don't practically guarantee death, like a tank or that sound wave machine, when you can't meet the crowds demands right then."
"The sad thing is, trump can't actually do much about this, it's on decades of republican and centrist democrat policy making that created such a brutal police force at the local levels, it's just now that protests have gotten bad enough that it's driven an already barbaric police force further over the edge."
Stop against media but please keep on against protesters...
So the media is resisting arrest? We all know what happens if you resist arrest boyz. \*shots in the background\*
">Global press urges President Trump

They need to cut out the middleman and go directly to Putin (which just about says it all about how far they'll get)"
"I can’t speak on all the international news agencies, but if people from Fox News, cnn, or msnbc get attacked, I couldn’t care less."
Cops aint the ones doing it. Its the protestors. But that doesnt fit the narrative so they blame the cops instead.
"So let me get this straight?

Defund the police!

Why would he curb the violence towards them? He likely gave the order to do so in the first place. It's all fake news the media is the enemy
"Media professionals?

The media is the entire problem...."
"Hope they care as much about journalists in Hong Kong and Turkish-occupied Middle East. Oh, they're not all Americans, so they probably won't."

This implies that Trump has been ordering police to attack journalists ... which the article does not provide proof for.  Also, if journalists are part of riots, they may get hurt."

Lol I bet Donnie loves police abuse.
For him this is basically a score sheet. The higher the number the more he’s ‘winning’.
"I see that anti media sentiment has gotten a lot bigger in the past couple of years, even here on reddit, including people just blindly upvoting straight up lies like the media wouldn't cover police brutality during the protests.  
Scary shit, considering the news media has always been one of the most important tools against corrupt government."
You might as well ask a dog to stand up and talk like a human
"""Police brutality against journalists has to stop!""

'Wasn't there also something about black people?'"
He doesn’t have the authority to make them stop. The president cannot legally order the police to do something.
He ordered abuse in the first place
Am I the only one thinking 'land of the free' had to have been an ironic statement when first said about a country built on slavery?
Freedom for the oligarchy. Everyone else is slave labor working the new-age cotton fields to keep them profiting and fill their gluttonous pockets.
"And the fact that they now have higher expectations of being left alone and people respecting rules of engagement in a WARZONE than here.

It's considered a war crime for a reason. Who knows what awful things are getting covered up otherwise?"
Sounds like we need some freedom
It was.. they're trying to kill it along with Julian Assange
"And he's always so proud of the violence they bestow, regardless of who they target, because in Trump's addled brain, if the police targeted them, there must be a reason."
"> he is making weekly Tweets about the police forces needing to dominate

How else should illegal rioters and saboteurs be dealt with? Giving in to every risky demand and setting the precende that violence equals change isn't how these situations are dealt with in a civilized country. And using Mexico's current approach of kindness and oppenness didn't work when handling similar situations."
"America is a joke and the world ~~is~~ has been laughing for decades.

Fixed that for you."
I understand why you're laughing and I'm not upset you're laughing at us either but I hope you also understand why I'm crying.
The funny think is.  I was at an open air flea market yesterday in SC and all of the booths of trump 2020 stuff had only the Make America Great logo stuff.  They used to all say Keep America Great.
You're so dramatic lmao yoo guys are obsessed with the US
"If America is a joke, it isn't funny. :("
I made a joke and the whole world cried.
And yet everyone wants to go there.
For those of us who didn’t vote for him...are we having fun right now???  Your comment assumes everyone in America is okay with his actions and everything he does is “All of America” and the president represents all people.  You act like we aren’t embarrassed as well.
"While at the same time doing the same shit in their own country(Poland, Hungary,Turkey)."
that seems like the plan

Probably the same mechanisms they had to stop them from beating up black people in the 70's - the FBI."

And trump is currently doing his best to further escalate the situation"

The two with the news banner in the middle of this video, one getting arrested, the other getting shot at with pepper rounds, and the one at the end getting arrested, are 3 of the aforementioned 400+ attacks on the press:

https://streamable.com/3lz296"
He could do something easy like not call every source of news that isnt republican propaganda fake or the enemy of the people. You know easy little things.
Getting shot in the face will do that to you
Oh I'll pick the 1st amendment so yeah the federal government can butt in.
"To be fair, Donnie does draw a lot of parallels with Hitler in his personality and the way he runs the government. He's capable of horrible things if the system allows for it."
https://www.criminaljusticeprograms.com/articles/what-are-consent-decrees/
Actually it is the other way around.  Trump has been driving a wedge and the media reports on it.  LMAO
"Most Americans think this too, which is why no one cares about down ballot votes"
"He may not be in command for everything, however his actions/tweets throughout the protest were far from acting as a kind of mediator, which he should definitely be."
"But never tired of missing the point and being outraged, I’m sure."
"It's a symbolic request that has thousands of people discussing police brutality towards the press.  I didn't realize the numbers were as high as they were and probably wouldn't have known had they not done this.  

When journalists are oppressed they take to their most powerful weapon:  the news.  And how do you make news in the USA?  Grand gestures and involve Trump.  It worked and we are now all talking about it."
"The point of the protests is that we want systemic change. We dont want small things, at the individual departmental level, to be done and then undone when we arent looking. That's what happens to criminal cops who are silently pardoned and set back to work over time.


Be wary of a few towns changing policy to placate the masses, while the worst of them are allowed to go free, and their set of rules to draw money from our pockets remain unchanged. 

The change we are asking for happens at the federal level, where the laws that are abused were made, where the police unions lobby."
"The president ranks higher than mayors and governors? So, if mayors aren’t handling the situation, there should be someone that Trump can talk to to force the mayors to be stricter with police."
"The DOJ can police the police. The Attorney General can open investigations into wrongdoing by local police. If they started doing that specifically for attacking press, local police would get the message and stop to avoid the pressure.

That would be what would happen in a functioning administration. Pretty sure nothing of the sort will happen until late January 2021."
By acting like the commander in chief perhaps.
"For instance by not publicly (press conferences and twitter) calling the news a ""fake news media"" and not encouraging police to be ""less polite""."
"How about not constantly attacking the media when they report on him negatively? 

How about not encouraging police brutality? 

How about having the FBI investigate law enforcement impeding the 1st amendment? 

Lots of other things he could do. But he won't do any of it, because he wants the police to be brutal, and he wants reporters to be afraid to report the truth."
"You're either fucking dumb or willfully ignorant. Which is it?

There have been multitudes of videos coming out showing the police openly attacking members of the press."
Can you provide video evidence of protesters assaulting members of the Press for us? Just so we have something to base this conclusion on. I'm willing to consider this assertion if you can provide evidence to back this claim up.
"So you are saying the police are the ones who are practicing self defense? Like shoving a 70+ year old to the ground, shooting someone with his hands up straight into the balls, etc etc. Or like arresting a news crew live on air?

You can't be so ignorant please."
I didn’t know civialian protestora were capable of arresting and blinding journalists live on air...
What has the media done that justifies being attacked?
There’s likely even more than that. I personally know 3 journalists in Charlotte that have been shot and tear gassed.
"Damn, 23 of those in my city. We should organize and express our displeasure of these attacks as a group."
"I love how that statistic doesn't even categorize tear gassing and rubber bullets as physical attacks.

As in, theree were officers who went out of their way to hit reporters with batons, fists or riot shields and it was so many, it deserves its own category."

"The president can legally have his DOJ investigate and prosecute police for civil rights violations. He also could also  fire and prosecute  the federal law enforcement officers he ordered to beat, gas and shoot protesters and journalists.

Since when has the law ever stopped Trump?
"Well, who do you think the freedom was for, the people not even allowed to vote initially?"
"That was a long time ago,and the constitution really was a milestone in terms of personal freedom when it was conceived tbh

The current situation however is nothing but infuriating. Not only trying to silence,but openly attacking journalists and the media in general is nothing short of an attack on the foundations of western values. I hope that other countries will start openly condemning this soon"
They actually only thought white men mattered when the country was founded
Built on and being sustained by slavery.
"*""The white cracker who wrote the national anthem knew what he was doing. He set the word 'free' to a note so high nobody can reach it.""*"
"I think the more people in a country scream ''land of the free'', the less freedom they have."
"Yes the English and Irish were brought to America against their will, that's why Land of the free celebrates the freedom from their oppressors.

You would think that being slaves of the British crown they would abolish all slavery, but people are stupid some times."
Yeah so attack innocent protestors and journalists. Makes sense.
"Illegal rioters and saboteurs should be peacefully arrested unless they pose a real and recognizable threat to the officer arresting them. But the police right now are throwing tear gas at people when even the military cant use them at war, and shooting anyone they so please with rubber bullets, especially disabled people and journalists. The police force in the US is a fucking joke and use their authority to abuse people."
"There are many ways to change the status quo and violence has always and will always be one.  There have been peaceful revolutions, but to say that it would be ""setting a precedent (there's a t in this word)"" by listening to both peaceful and violent protestors would be ignoring the 200something years that came before this in our nation's history (and completely ignoring the, you know, thousands and thousands of years before it)."
"> How else should illegal rioters and saboteurs be dealt with?

Probably not by shooting the press and innocent protesters and people sitting on their own front porch.

https://streamable.com/3lz296

Don't you find it weird how all the videos of rioters have the police just standing there, and all the videos of protesters are of the police beating them up?  It's almost like they want the riots."
hahaha americans don’t realize how closed off the nationalism truly is
"No, we haven't. We have chuckled for decades and said ""well, i guess that is one way to do it"", meaning that at least the system works, even if it sounded often insane. We stopped chuckling after Trump was elected and had a long belly laugh, so much that we are now quite tired of laughing. It is clear that the system never really worked, it was just good at hiding things from us."
It was more like rolling our eyes before but now it's choking from laughter.
Its like you dont remember the world collectively jacking off the US while Obama was in office to the point of giving him a Nobel peace prize for basically no reason.
"this. and everytime we tell them that the rest of the world basically does just that, they cant believe it haha."
"Yes! Everyone please, you do not want to come here. You would hate it. Police kill sober black men headed to choir practice every day.  Every white person is a racist and is filthy rich from privilege. We have the worst doctors on the planet ( not sure why we still get patients from all over though). For your own good, stay in your own country where you dont have any issues ."
You won't be laughing if a US drone dropped thousands of bombs on your home.

Not throwing gas on the fire isn't putting out the fire.
And yet he's going to win again because dems can't get a proper candidate.
"The majority of the media no longer acts with any journalistic integrity. They don’t report they generate content to consume, they’ve become “entertainers” and thus want nothing more than generate continuous “outrage” and “clicks” to drive revenue. Trump isn’t any better or worse than the past few presidents the US has had. They’re all the same."
Then why didn’t google that
"That's not how the United States government works.

The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights, was ratified on December 15, 1791. It expresses the principle of federalism and states' rights, which strictly supports the entire plan of the original Constitution for the United States of America, by stating that the federal government possesses only those powers delegated to it by the United States Constitution; all remaining powers are reserved for the states or the people."
Haven't you heard? The buck stops somewhere else these days.  Not really sure where
"That works with the Military, not the police."
It's the responsibility of the local police. The president is commander in chief of the military. Unless you're suggesting that he send in the military to restore order.
How about the media stops acting like a Fifth Column? The “truth” they claim to be reporting on is heavily biased propaganda to further their agenda.
Report it https://twitter.com/uspresstracker/status/1271898384421380096
You do know its thugs not police who do most of the violence
"That'll lead to an increase in rubber bullets and tear gas being used. Many of these journalists and protesters have been hit due to not moving away from chaotic areas on the directive from the authorities. Some have stood in the way. Some have intensified the unstable situation. 

Some violations have been made, and that's been apologized for. But these figures are very misleading."
Pretty well establishes that we have to be wary of these people who intend to harm us and the media.
Why does it look like them hats have been superimposed on?
Don't worry soon covid we'll start killing them off
"I mean, if I was a cop and just arrested someone who beat his girlfriend to death for trying to stop him  from raping her 5 year old daughter, the last thing I am going to want to do is gently guide his head while loading him into the back of my cruiser.

Edit: so I don't have to write the same reply multiple times.

I never said I condoned police brutality. I don't think the police should be judge and jury. I was simply stating why I understand the audiences reaction.

I'm sure every police officer in attendance has had someone in their custody whose actions completely disgusted them, and they hate the fact that they have to be so careful with a total piece of garbage human that they need to make sure he doesn't bump his own head accidentally. 

I imagine the majority of officers in attendance were thinking of that piece of garbage they had to care for, not about the guy they pulled over for not signaling.

You're painting them all as monsters when you don't know what they are thinking about."
"They don't believe that human rights should be applied to criminals. They don't believe that culprits should be treated leniently, with kid gloves and with cookies/hugs. I can understand why. These people (if it's proven that they're a perpetrator) aren't precisely contributing to communities, to the betterment of the country or to raising humanity. Why should they receive treatment that equals incentivizations to the behaviour? That's not how crime is dealt with effective. You don't serve justice that way either."
"Why don't you rail against the local and state leaderships for not using their legal authority to keep their police forces from attacking and to punish the attackers?

These aren't Trump's police, these are democrat's police forces.

Don't answer, we all know - it is because these are democrat run cities with democrat mayors and democrat city councils whose police forces are committing these violent acts.

Screw you and your (and the ""global media"") concern trolling."
"Yeah and that will take years and years to be accomplished especially with the amount of investigations that would be needed. It would have barely begun by the time this term is over. What we need is local government stepping up. If every city and state investigates and prosecutes police, it would be far more effective than some top down mandate. All Trump can really do is encourage the local and state governments to handle it."
"Since he was elected, but the law is immaterial because he doesn’t have the authority. He cannot just pass a executive order saying “stop police brutality against news people”. Well he could, but no one would listen to it because he cannot order them. Would you like to know who could order them to stop? Or at least begin to fix the issue. It’s their mayors and governors. Who, by the way, are almost all Democrats."
There were plenty of people at the time pointing out that these cries for freedom were coming from the drivers of negroes.
"WASP

Others didn't count as real whites. Catholics were looked at as cult members. JFK caught a lot of flack for being catholic."
They still do.
"Some of the founders certainly did. They believed in a natural aristocracy (i.e. that rich, white, educated, males should always hold power) which is some of the earliest roots of American conservatism. Conversely, some of the founders believed that slavery was contrary to the spirit of the revolution. Some, like Ben Franklin, even joined the early abolitionist movement. Unfortunately, the necessity of the southern states for maintaining unity in the tenuous period after the country formed meant they kicked that can way down the road. And we're still suffering the side effects of their refusal to take a decisive stance on the issue to this day."
Please.  Quickly and with great vigor.
"A lot of us do, and really we’re just sad about it."
I think Obama won the Nobel Peace prize just because he wasn't Bush Jr.
It's because Bush was so horrendous that we were glad anyone else got into office. And then Trump happened.
"“We’re all guaranteed access to affordable, quality health care, regardless of how much money we make or who our current employer is. Our leaders don’t reject science, threaten to jail their political opponents, or attack the free press by calling it ‘the enemy of the people.’ We don’t have mass shootings. We don’t have militarized police, and we don’t jail millions of our own citizens every year to keep a prison-industrial complex profitable, because we don’t have one of those either. So yeah. We’ll stay.” —a European"
What’s one more war crime to the long list of crimes our country has committed across the globe. Just chill the fuck out with American Exceptionalism. It’s not there anymore. Hasn’t been there since the turn of the century.
"Hahaha, this is so much like the new Netflix show, Space Force, and all the guys wanting to fix every problems with different bomb sizes. Hahahaha."
"> You called me a racist in so many words. I’m not a Trump supporter. **Didn’t vote for him in 2016 but plan on voting for him in Nov.** There’s a big difference. I obviously went to see it. Not something a racist would do. Even went a second time just to give it another chance and found it disappointing. The fact that you went on my feed to find some “dirt” proves how pathetic you really are. Lol, what a loser.

F."
I don’t think you understand American politics all that well if this is your take.
"The whole state of the US is very complex and to boil it down to, ""You (the people) made this mess."" is either misinformed or deliberately inflammatory.  Stupid or ignorant people in the US are certainly a big part of the problem, but the majority of the problems stem from the ""elites"" of our society from the past ~70 years.

That said, I fully intend to leave here and move abroad to a better country, but the US has so many issues with it that I don't know how you'd fix it within our lifetimes at this point."
"Lmao, look at this dude thinking it's about trump. The U.S. is hot garbage since it's conception."
"That argument holds very little logic. With your reasoning, the people the US messed up had it coming, because the shit the government does, the people deserves to be punished for by extension."
"and that rightfully, he may not be in direct charge of the police forces, but a leader who makes up fake stories to cover police who shoved a 70+ year old to the ground or commanding the military to clear his path for a photo shoot, is clearly setting the wrong example"
"It's a symbolic request and arguing that it ""does nothing"" ignores the fact that we are now all talking about it. 

I certainly didn't know the number of journalists attacked were as high as they are, but because they did this symbolic gesture I now know."
"> No. What they're saying is that Trump is not in charge of the police.

Unless it's ordering local police departments across the country to ""dominate"", he can definitely send that message, he just can't even raise a finger to tweet ""stop eroding the fourth estate""."
"Oh really?   Of course many do and you should seek them out.  

>Trump isn’t any better or worse than the past few presidents the US has had.

Your undies are showing..."
"That would explain why the government cannot conduct mass surveillance on people, why they cannot establish minimum wage, and why the president can't force Twitter to stop being mean to him via executive order. I think the president has a few more duties and powers now than when the tenth Amendment was inked."
No wonder the US dying
Impeach him!
So you think there's a global conspiracy to protect Trumps perfect reputation?
Asking the other way around - what has he done to address the problem? As president of a democratic country such events should always be of great concern
The truth is the truth. Just because you don't like it doesn't make it propaganda.
".. it's filmed. The cops are often the aggressors. I actually haven't seen a single video of media being attacked by ""thugs.""

Unless the protestors are arresting media and firing pepper spray and rubber bullets, the majority of those press freedom violations are pretty obviously committed by the police."
Basically all of it originated from cops. This counts for inciting violence on protests too.
Lol sure
That boot must taste great!
"Heavy floodlight shining from the floor, it removes shadows. In this case, it is meant to illuminate faces so it ends up removing all shadows. If i had to guess... that light was added at the last moment or its intensity put to max. It isn't nice but quite harsh. One of the problems with shadows are that they hide details from the image but are also needed for showing depth, that the objects are not just floating in the air."
"You got your answer, i'm just linking to r/ConfusingPerspective for other example of shadow magic."
"No police officer is in charge of sentencing or punishment of anyone, let alone someone that hasn't been found guilty of a crime.  To excuse violence towards the accused by the police is slipping closer and closer into full on into some Judge Dredd type policing where punishment from the police is condoned."
"With every act if police brutality against a person who is indeed guilty, is another reason for said person to potentially walk free. It's a cops job to protect the people and remove persons believed to be a threat. What do we do when the police are threatening us?"
"Well, besides the fact we should at least pretend to not be revenge obsessed fascists, they haven't had a trial by that time. Also, I dont really think that not being murdered in police custody counts as kid gloves. If anything its the police we've treated with cookies and hugs every time they act out"
"You nailed it when you wrote ""if it's proven that they're a perpetrator."" Cops aren't judges or juries and they don't get to make that decision."
"COPS ARE NOT IN CHARGE OF JUSTICE.  We've developed an entire criminal justice system that makes it so one person alone doesn't get to decide whether a criminal deserves to be beat up for committing a crime, and in the cases you are describing the person hasn't even been convicted, only accused.  

They are not judge, jury, and executioner and your explaining it away as ""what they deserve"" is perverse."
"How about all the people wrongfully arrested? Or misdemeanors? My dad is a store manager and hired a man who used to be homeless. The man told my dad every November he used to ""steal"" something and get caught so he would have a warm place to sleep and a hot meal during the winter. The system is broken. We need educated, unbiased police officers, and leave the sentencing to the actual judicial court."
"I hear you in not wanting to encourage behavior that is detrimental to society. One point I'd ask you to consider: is everyone who commits a crime a lost cause with no hope of redemption? Because if the ultimate goal is to have everyone coexist in a moral society, then there's a big difference between treating someone as a ""criminal"" (defining that person by their crime) versus treating them as a ""person who committed a crime"" (leaving room for positive change). Obviously, the patience and leniency shown to a murderer or rapist should be very different from a shoplifter. What do you think about this?"
"You identified the biggest problem. The police generally are before any conviction. Even having a warrant out doesn't mean they are convicted. Police powers in the USA are insane. The idea of small town police working for a council plus a mayor just doesn't vibe with me. I moved to Sydney, Australia and the police here are often legit friendly as well as they are a single state wide organisation. Bad cops here face consequences so issues are not as common. (i cant speak for police in other AU states)"
"""They don't believe that human rights should be applied to criminals.""  

That's a bummer because that means they disagree with the rules of law we have set up, namely the 8th amendment to the constitution.   If you believe that police shouldn't be using ""kid gloves"" with the accused, then you fundamentally disagree with our constitution."
Oh so now you're admitting he does have the authority but it'd just be too much work to uphold the constitution. Keep moving the goalposts.
"So too clarify what  you are saying. Trump, the boss of mayors and governors, is unable to order them because they are democrats? Is this more proof of the Deep State that is outside of Trump's control?

You are correct, we should have the democrats arrested. If only there was someone who could order them to do it! :("
"Yes, they were in Massachusetts that banned slavery before any other major world power. New York was shortly after. Don't think there's not nuance in this."
"You are aware of what European kings and emperors were doing at the same time? Yes,slavery was a thing in America,and obviously terrible,but it’s not like they were the only ones practicing it."
"Contrary to popular belief, many if not most of the founders were not particularly religious. Religiosity has gone through boom and bust cycles all throughout American history and the founding of the nation was in one of those bust cycles, hence the attempts to enshrine secularism and religious freedom into the constitution. Many of the founders were still active in politics when the Treaty of Tripoli was signed in 1796, and that states:

>As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen [Muslims]; and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan [Mohammedan] nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.

The religion crept back in gradually, as it does. The Cold War in particular got it super enshrined. Never let a good crisis go to waste, as they say."
"Whoa theres layers to this. 

Raciception"
There's always canada?
"Ikr, and wth do they expect us to do about it? As if voting for either trump or biden would make any difference to healthcare, rasicm, lack of affordable housing or minimum wage."

"Glad someone in USA has a brain. There so many countries bombed and destroyed it is not even a joke anymore, it is too fucking real. Yet most american public are still oblivious to what their country have been doing since Vietnam."
Yep that is America for you. I am not even surprised at the amount of war crimes they committed because of 'freedom'.
The guy literally said he wasn’t trying to insult him hahahaha
"Hate will never win, this mans cant even write out a coherent sentence. His logic is so fucked, he believed he was a victim to reddit bullying"

"No, he isn't. We deserve better than him. And the majority of us voted for someone better than him.

Don't blame the people for inheriting a corrupt system from the baby boomers who destroyed a once-good thing."
"Sorry, I am not willing to give them an easy pass. Americans had good options such as Justice Democrats and Bernie but chose to ignore them equating them to Communism or green eyed Venezuela monsters. These are easy platforms similar to other OECD countries.

American citizens have some agency, and constantly misuse it."
That's rationalizing the problem. If coronavirus has shown us anything is that elites only have the power we give them. You don't like apple? Stop buying their shit and you'll have them on their knees in three months.
Are you agreeing with me or lol? Because I agree.
Okay go tell all the innocent the U.S. killed that.
"That's the role of congress. To write and pass bills such as the patriot act or the fair labor standards act.

No bill has been written giving the POTUS control of state and local law enforcement.

An executive order granting that power would be quicy stuck down in the courts."
Lol the US is doing fine.
Doing quite well actually.
"What country are you from, and has your current constitution lasted for 233 years?"
He's already been impeached. Removal is what needs to happen nowish.
"No, I think their response is to treat him as if he matters, as if he cares and could somehow come around. They treat this administration like they actually believe in politics or rules of law. And that's a mistake. They need to break with tradition about their holding back on a full on attack on this turd."
"Exactly. He should unify the country.


It's never been this divided."

"Hey, I'll have you know every looter I've seen has been white. And believe I'm looking because I'm  a white nationalist or nazi , or whatever label scares you."
"It you truly feel safer in a crowd with rioters and looters, then you are beyond delusional."
"I wasn't saying we should allow police brutality, or that we should become judge and jury. I was simply explaining why I could understand the audiences responce to the statement. 

I'm sure every officer, at one point or another, was escorting someone whose actions completely disgusted them, and in that moment hated the fact that they had to be as gentle as possible to prevent this person from even bumping thier own head accidentally."
"Absolutely, he has the authority to order the doj to investigate and prosecute these officers. But it would take a long long time to do it, and it will not stop the root cause of the issue. What I’m saying needs to be done is the local government, mayors and governors need to do this instead of relying on the feds. It’s not the presidents job to discipline local law enforcement. The local government needs to grow a pair and take responsibility instead of passing the buck."
"> Trump, the bosses of mayors and governors,

Public school?"
I'm guessing you aren't American.   The President isn't the boss of Governors or Mayors.
"First off, Trump is not the boss of the mayors, perhaps it could be argued that Trump is the boss of the Governors, but he would only have the authority to order governors if backed by a bill passed by Congress. The president is not a dictator he exists to enforce Congress edicts. So he cannot order around state and local government all he can do is attempt to enforce the bills congress passes. It has nothing to do with them being dems and everything to do with the legal powers of the president. He could more order any of them regardless of their political party. I never mentioned or implied anything about the deep state. And I certainly never said that Democrats should be arrested!! Why would you think I said that. I would never support such a course of action. And I very glad there is not someone that can order the arrest of a entire political party, that would be horrific."
"This is a really stupid argument. Those kings didn't virtue signal and proclaim to be the land of the free or that all men were created equal like a bunch of hypocrites. That's the point of the thread you're replying to, that America being the land of the free must've been sarcastic/ironic."
"“W-w-whatabout????”

Your comment is useless, sir."
"Personally as a foreigner I have never felt that the USA represents freedom. Felt more like ""free to carry guns and work your ass off for your corporation""."
As an outsider I haven’t viewed America as freedom for a long time. You have some good entertainment but that’s about it tbh :)
"As a foreigner every time I used to go to the US I felt asphyxiated, so many rules just to enter the country, drive, hire services like hotels, buy tickets for events, parking, etc. Everything is just this convoluted number of rules that some times makes me think it's just there to evaluate how much money they can get from you by measuring your stupidity or your laziness. And every government employee is so mad at everyone, all the time, even at Disney world."
"US never standed for freedom. For the rest of world, US means imperialist state."
Maybe if you go back far enough when it was easier to curate your image by propaganda. Like after the world wars. But during my lifetime the US has never been representing freedom.
">we used to represent freedom, now it’s just idiocy

This is quite literally what we're talking about when we say you guys are deluded about yourselves - America has never represented freedom to anyone other than Americans. To most of the world, America has represented greed, imperialism and violence for decades."

"Redditor for 21 hours, which country do you live in?"
"I generally agree with your statements here and you actually have a grasp on federalism. I guess the problem though is, federalism in the US has made a weird turn at some point, since it seems (to my outsiders view) that the republican party and their supporters have formed this binary form of thinking of us vs them and most republican politicians would never do anything against the consensus of the party as they would lose support from the party and their voters for it. So when every republican member of congress and senate default to the presidents opinion, it does little trying to change their minds."

Have you ever been in a crowd of rioters and looters?
Someone stealing shit from a Macy’s doesn’t actually make it legal for the government to attack members of the press.
"Rioters don't see me and charge me for an attack. They aim at materials. Cops don't shoot at equipment. They don't try to wreck the camera, but the cameraman"
"If you can't control your own violent impulses towards someone when you are in the position of power and dealing with someone that is already in your control then you shouldn't be a cop.  I can't possibly say that I understand that feeling because frankly, wishing harm on another person when you have that much power is troubling to me and not something I can even start to excuse.

I'm going to edit this post to address something in your initial post:  

""...The last thing I am going to want to do is gently guide his head while loading him into the back of my cruiser.""   This is so incredibly problematic that I want you to step back and reassess why you believe it.  It's okay to have a different point of view and I have no problem with that, but please try to do a bit of introspection to address why you think this is not only true, but is okay/should be condoned.  

Violence by the police cannot and should not ever be explained away as ""They were angry and the person deserved it."" which is strikingly close to what you are saying."
Is that what Americans call the place where they praise the flag and learn that they are the greatest people in the world?
"So why is he giving them orders?

"I see that is odd, because in earlier comments you say that he always follows the law?  
Perhaps you could explain the confusion displayed here then:

"It’s literally not. I’m European,but the constitution really was a major step for freedom. Have you heard of Biedermeier?"
"It depends on what lens you look at it through, but I find myself agreeing more and more with this every day (especially now that I have a full-time office job. Really opens my eyes to what “the Dream” is supposed to be). 

I like to read literature, especially antebellum American lit, because it’s really eye opening and kind of alludes to what we’re all feeling now. I’m thinking specifically of Herman Melville’s “Bartleby, the Scrivener,” which I totally recommend."
"In the 60s to 80s, it really was our view and there was a kernel of truth in it. After USSR fell, we finally could start talking about the systematic flaws it has. And that was around Clinton... There were a certain secret agreement to not point out to US flaws so much.. But as  a Finn in the 80s, we didn't talk about USSR in public but we knew how it was in private. We didn't really know what the reality is in USA. To us it was Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte, hollywood formed most of it.

So, it was beacon of freedom, even if it was mostly made up image. First Gulf War started the eventual decline of that image and without USSR being a threat, we didn't need to color the truth anymore."
yup. as a Canadian I really don't feel like America has represented freedom for a looooong time.
"Throughout the 20th century the USA absolutely represented freedom. As a personal anecdote, my grandparents were italian immigrants and would absolutely say it did. 

And if you read 20th century opinions of America, yes, America represents freedom. Or if you ask asylum-seekers who escaped the USSR during the cold war to a country which was inside the US-led western alliance, yes, they would absolutely say America represents freedom.

America had a very popular reputation for democratic ideals for many years. Freedom, equality, meritocratic opportunity. It was only until recent history that she has now fallen away from those ideals, and appropriately, that her global reputation has faded."
Idiocracy but close enough. Just wanted to clarify for anyone who might not know.
Lol
"not one government in Europe is that old.

hell when the US was founded they were still absolute monarchies, most European constitutions are more recent than the US by some time."
Ok not since the Civil War.
This is ironic.  Everyone believes the propoganda they want to believe and dismisses the stuff they dont agree with.  Wtf happend to looking at the data?
"Check the sources in the description for yourself. They back up my statement. The statistics represent the “truth”. 

Or, could you just be simply discounting it because you don’t want your perception challenged? What are you so afraid of? 

If what I linked is just “dumb racist garbage”, it should be easily refuted by an intellectual such as yourself who has knowledge of the “truth”. 

Could it be that you are just blindly following a narrative without actually looking at the statistical evidence? 

You’re as blind as someone in a religious cult.

>Just because you don’t like it doesn’t make it propaganda.

Ironic."
"Wow, thay comment had to have come from Biden lol"
"Well, I've never been in a position of power, but I am a mother, and, quite frankly, I do wish hard on pedophiles and child rapists, and anyone who prays on children. 

There is also a difference, between wanting someone to get hurt, and actually hurting them. If I was in a position of power, then I wouldn't beat the snot out of the guy, but if karma decided to hit by him stepping on a rusty nail in the yard while walking to the cruiser, I wouldn't be particularly upset about it either."
"You're right. But I think everyone has seen a story that was so aweful that they hoped the person who did it ""gets what he deserves"" in prison. 

There is a man in prison right now who raped a 3 month old baby to death. I personally hope he dies before his time is served. 

I think it's human nature to wish harm on people who do things so far beyond morally wrong that it disgusts you. That doesn't mean we act on it though."
"in freedom for some, not for all.  That was the point of what people are saying."
"Yes, I am familiar with the Biedermeier period, as well as its corresponding art and architecture movements. 

However, for some reason whenever American slavery gets brought up, jabronis come out of the woodwork to bring up every other instance of slavery in history. 

It’s not relevant and only serves to dilute the conversation"
"everything that america prides itself for being the best at with regards to freedom is done better by other countries. That's why they are a laughing stock. 

It's like the stupid kid in class putting up his hand to try and correct the answer a smart kid gave and the stupid kid absolutely butchers it and just nudges his friends and laughs at the smart kid. Later he gets he big friends to bully the smart kid for making him look stupid."
Why would I want to check the so called sources in a video that has to play with reversed images? Why don't you link actual sources instead of some dumb ass conspiracy video?
"Wishing harm on the accused is the issue.  And excusing it away as ""they were really mad"" only helps perpetuate the acceptance of police violence in America.  The real question you need to ask is ""where do we draw the line""?  If a cop is pretty sure someone raped someone, is it then okay for them to lash out?  What if the person is accused of using a $20 that might be fake? 
 Where is the line between the two and how to we excuse one but not the other?  They are both accused of something illegal, and the execution of one is now being condemned, which in and of itself should explain why the former is just as inexcusable."
But more than before.
"It is in this context tho. You have to judge systems and morals accordingly to their respective time periods,doing it from a modern perspective is utterly pointless and stupid. that’s literally what I was saying too,that the constitution was a big step forward compared to the rest of the world. Of course it’s nowhere near perfect,but I did not claim that it was. 

I was also replying to a commenter who implied that America never had anything to do with freedom,which is just not true,for reasons stated above 

Read the second part of my original comment for my views on the current events"
That's very specific.
"You're putting words in my mouth again. I said I understood the reaction of the crowd. I understood why someone would applaud the idea of not cradling  someone's head (and only this one action) while putting them in their cruiser.

I never said I condoned police violence. Not once. And the scenario I gave involved an officer *wanting* to see harm done to a person, not *doing* harm to a person. There is a difference."
There's absolutely no reason we HAVE to judge cultures by their time period.

We went down to Eastwood farm and it was sunny with only the occasional cloud. Lots of people swimming in the river. Was pretty toasty in the sun yesterday.
I bet it’s skanky AF though.

It was included in ""Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95"", before that add-on pack was integrated into Windows 98, thus the themes, Pinball, and Spider Solitaire followed, then it followed into Windows ME along with some ""Plus! 98"" components, and subsequently into Windows XP, which in turn was the last Windows release to have Plus packs."
"It's all the land that used to be the airport. 15 years ago there was a lot more, but they've built on most of it now.

Pretty sure that field is at risk now."
I make this argument all the time!
"Heya leb, fancy seeing you here!

I guess I should peel away from the computer for a bit today. All I noticed was the spot of rain later in the day, yesterday"
"Oh, I was on my cell-phone and was having trouble getting a good view in Google Maps. I thought it was just the one grassy hill, but now that I have it on desktop I see that there's plenty more behind it.

Is that an airplane runway a bit further south?"
"Yeah we've had the odd shower, but last night was proper sustained rain.

You can tell the difference looking at your lawn. Mine was yellow yesterday. Woke up this morning and it's going green again."
"Yeah same here in east Sussex, fucking strange innit?"
"It always looks so nice on Fireman Sam. Are you saying that Pontypandy isn't an accurate representation of Wales?

Mind you, if they had rain all the time it'd be less interesting to watch because there would less fires because Norman wouldn't be able to go out as much.

Norman is a dick, his mum needs to give him a proper bollocking...also, Sam should man up and take some responsibility for his kid."
Same. My sinuses are wrecked.
And me. Even my daily antihistamine has been struggling!
"What took you to Inverness, if I might ask? My wife and I are a little fed up paying an Oxfordshire mortgage and are considering moving elsewhere in the UK. I love the Highlands (my mum’s from Dingwall) and would move there in a heartbeat if I could persuade my wife. What sort of jobs are up there? Not that physical proximity to work is really that important to us right now..."
"Have to LOVE Inverness.  
There's a great little pub on the Loch at Ness near Doric.  
Short drive from town.  
Very ancient."
"All I can tell you is that it's been higher than it has ever been which hasn't been helped with the insane dryness.

I'm sure it hasn't helped with the Covid cases due to larger numbers of people being snotty and generally having a fucked respiratory system."
"Well no, I like many other people, have a garden. Front and back I'll have you know."
"I was actually begging for it. Had a circle of candles and books on the occult in the attic and everything.

I was halfway through the Lament Configuration before I heard thunder. So I stopped and did a ""Shawshank"" outside.

Was ready to be strung up and ripped apart by the cenobites in hell as it was probably cooler there than around here."
Now I feel cheated it's not a picture of the tunnel.
"I spent about eight hours walking round Bristol over the course of a week and didn't see nearly that much green, and I was staying at a hotel on Cribbs Causeway! Wish I'd have known it was there."
"Ha I didn't even notice it was you!

My wife is out with my eldest two today - socially distanced grandmother visit in the garden - so its just me and my youngest. Trying to judge a decent gap in the weather to pop down to the allotment with him."
"It's the old Filton runway. It was sold off to building developers a few years ago.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Filton_Airport"
Sam tân is 100% accurate and you should take it all as gospel. On a side note the weather is stunning today making me look like a right lying prick
Quite a few people are moving to Scotland it seems. Mortgages will be pushed up there before you know it.
"My wife and I married in 2018 and we drove the North Coast 500 route as our honeymoon. After the clean air and water, friendly people, cooler weather and frankly staggering views, we fell in love with the Highlands! 

I work in Air Traffic Control so we waited until a vacancy came up, and then we jumped at the chance! We’ve absolutely loved the five/six months we’ve been up here, the only thing we’ve struggled with is during lockdown, not having so much of that community support because we didn’t know very many people. Even that’s only because we’d been up here for less than three months when we locked down.

All in all I would most definitely recommend it, especially if you’re looking for a more relaxed pace of life. There aren’t many people I’ve spoken to who have bad words to say about the Highlands! Inverness is a thriving city too, I’m sure you’ll find most industries in or around the city. One downside though is that as an up and coming city, this is driving house prices up. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still much cheaper than around Oxford, but it’s not as cheap as you’d expect when you think about the Scottish Highlands.

Drop me a line when you move!"
"We’ll be sure to visit, once we’re allowed!"
"Yea. After all this now, I've got one hell of a storm brewing probably gonna knock out the power too."
Now might be your chance! Git out there!
"Oh righto..I forgot. You are all still locked up. We have been let out for a few weeks now so can drive around, but not interstate. Still no outside visitors, or very very few returning from o/s. No international flights here since February I think."
"I'm glad of the storms, I watched Beyond Thunderdome the other day during the heat and I was convinced that's where Britain was going.

I wouldn't mind but wearing S&M gear with all that sand in the heat wouldn't agree with me. My arsehole would look like a dropped trifle in a week."
"It’s crazy how connected the world was just a few short months ago compared to nowadays. 

Here in Scotland pubs and shops are closed, takeaways/fast food places are open for takeaway or delivery, still being told to stay at home as much a possible but we’re allowed to travel in the local area for exercise, and meet one other household outdoors while social distancing."

The shit eating or the grin?
"[First, from R.B. Smith, affiliated with the formidable UCSD astrophysics program, comes a story from his more bucolic days on a Midwest farm. “The expression does seem to have emigrated [from the farm] in a slightly evolved form. The origin was ‘Grinning like a ’possum eating shit’ (which was occasionally euphemized to ‘Grinning like a ’possum eating pumpkin seeds’). To those of us fortunate enough to have observed this teeth-together-lips-apart ‘smile’ on the face of the aforementioned marsupial munching on the aforementioned scatological delicacy, the expression conjures up a very explicit and not infrequently very apropos image.”

Fax number two, from Skip Skown of Ocean Beach, says, “I’ve been under the lifelong impression that ‘shit-eating grin’ refers to the expression that appears on a dog’s face when it’s caught gobbling up a pile of, uhhh, fecal material deposited by another animal. We’ve all seen how a dog can curl up its lips in a semblance of a grin. And we’ve also seen many dogs whose favorite snack could be found in a cat’s litter box. My theory is that it’s a sheepish grin caused by being caught in the act. Or maybe the lip motion helps clean the stuff off their teeth.""](https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/1993/aug/05/straight-shit-eating-grin-complicated-history/)"

"Actually funnily enough, humans have a much larger impact on wildlife than nuclear accidents. Almost as soon as humans left, animals have thrived in Chernobyl. 

The main reason for this is, while radiation can cause birth defects, the main reason why humans don't want to be in high amounts of it is cancer risk. When your lifespan is 5 years, though, cancer is much less likely to occur."

Comment
"When I got my first job as a school custodian I worked overnight, and one day I found a kid had drawn an empty tic tac toe grid on her desk. We're normally supposed to wash writing off desks but I drew in an X for the hell of it and left it there. The next day I saw she'd written in an O, and for the next year we'd play tic tac toe without ever having met each other, occasionally writing lighthearted trash talk when one of us would win.


At the end of the school year the kid had won more games than she'd lost so I bought a silly little trophy for her, engraved and all. Towards the end of the school year we started working afternoons when the kids were around and I got to meet the kid who'd beaten me. Funniest kid I've ever met, and apparently our tic tac toe matches were the talk of the class. Definitely my favorite memories of working at that school."
tik tok is getting to the kids
Quick question. Did you word this wrong or are you commiting felonies?
That's cute. But have hou tried playing tic tac toe with an Ouija board
This is so sweet!
If the kid is X that's a pretty shit opening move. If he's O... Well played.
What's so special about playing tik tak toe with their dad? /s
"I love how they wrote ""mail *person*"". Such inclusion"
r/wholesome
I genuinely thought this pic was taken from the behind of a small lorry and this was a huge tic tac toe game
Is the pen included ?
"as a mail person, this is fucking awesome"
Lol imagine your the mail man and you realize this is the house of a middle aged man who lives alone
"This is obviously staged. 

I mean, believe the story about playing tic tax toe with the mailman, but the way the mailbox is clearly open and in perfect view of the camera makes me think that this photo was taken on purpose."
"I don’t get why you Americans call it tik tak toe, in Australia we call it naughts and crosses"
"Foolish child, only noobs go for the center!"
Need more of this!
Looks like little Joshua is going to get a lesson in futility.

Does the too of the page say Mail poopie?
r/nextfuckinglevel
Lol that's a federal crime
"Mail persons only, no femail"
"Bro, what's with people crapping on X's move? Center is *optimal* play"
no it's tik tok toe
That’s just wholesome and cute
US Post looks inside your mailbox?
Let us know who wins.
Tik tok lmao
This is cute
Need to know who won
I like the idea that this was made by a fully grown adult.
Are you the kid or the mail carrier?
Idk I’m gonna go gamble with it.
They haven’t played with mods yet
Looks like Damon Albarn's handwriting :D
"But they didn't leave a pen...

Mailman: NOOOOooooooooooooo----!"
u/woogieface isn’t this your kids?
Playing the long game. I love it!
That looks like a strange octopus with a handgun
Kid forgot to leave a pen! How will mailman draw his move?!
r/mademesmile
Well Floridaman’s not turf toe.
It would scare the shit out of me if i saw that suddenly when opening a mail box
"Mailman: I don't have time for this shit, but if I don't play I'm an asshole"
the ultra rare /r/aww with no humans or animals
"lol, dumbass kid has that shit app poisoning his brain."

[Kid be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH4N_l778bE)
"My mail person would definitely just,steak,the damn pen if it was left in there."
This is just like Mumbo and Grian playing tic tac toe
give that kid and postman a damn medal
Mail person? It's Phoenix Person now.
"Plot twist: It wasn't a kid and the other side says, 'You lose, you die!'"
That looks like a strange octopus with a handgun
Would you let the kid win though?
Kid tried to take over
"he also has a ""forsaaan"" tic"
"when I was a kid, play by mail games were a thing.
my favorite was 'its a crime'
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_a_Crime_(play-by-mail_game)"
Thats adorable!
"That kids screwed, do you know how long he has to contemplate his next move"
This quarantine hit some of us harder than others.
Next time it’s global thermonuclear war
Use this approach: “Don’t break your toe
Yep. Sounds like a man playing against kids.
Ricks new best friend-mail person
"""mail person"" ok"
That’s some wholesome stuff right there.
I wonder if mail carriers think of people's houses by their names or addresses? Like would he think of this as the Smythe kid or the 258 elm kid?
Of course they took the middle.
"""for mail person"""
"this isn't mildly interesting, it's just cute and funny. Wrong sub man"
Mail *person*
Trying to think of how you can lose this but unless you severely mess up you've already won.
Nice
OK that's really creative
Mail Person lmfao
It’s a draw
That is soooooo sweet...
Okay. Epic.
By end of the toe box.
This is nice
This is kinda wholesome
Kid shouldn't have a phone.
Honestly this is just r/wholesome
tiny people are adorable
You stole this from r/USPS.
That’s sweet. Great quarantine activity!
We need updates
If they win they should get to pick one item out of his mail bag that day and if the mailman wins he gets to bang their mom
"They even said mail person, bless this 21st century kid"
Nice!
Not their profits though
Wholesome
Why is it called tic tac toe¿
By end of the toe box.
"Tik tak toe must be one of the only comparative English words that has a more literal name in British English, (Xs and Os). Usually I find that the American term needs less explaining. Tick tack toe comes from tic tack, which is obviously another game in which that is the sound made."
"Ah yes, their Thaitainium line of quality tools"
r/aww
Thats adorable! Looks like the mailman is down to tussle
Is Op is just opening peoples mail boxes like a cunt
At either end of the toe box.
"The only way to make this stupid game be worth playing in any way, is by reducing the time a player is allowed to think about the next move less then 0.5 seconds or/and to put the players under extrem additional stress. As even Joshua, the 70s version of AI was able to determine within seconds: 
The only winning move is not to play."
Kid playin the long game
This looks like a serial killer note.
"i see both a x and o, kinda fun to see the mail carrier is playing along"
He comments using carrier pigeon.
I took my upvote back as soon as I saw TikTok. (Just kidding did upvote but someone has to stop TikTok from taking over the world)
Where would you play next? I'd go top right.
Trump’s handwriting is certainly coming along nicely.
i dont think this is illegal but im sure theres some kind of rule against it at least hahaha.
Does it say mail poopie at the top?
"r/aww, this is so cute."
"Wow, what about female persons?"
"Man, drug dealers are upping their branding nowadays."
Mail Person! This very politically correct
Yeah the mailman ain't busy at all. He's there to entertain yo kids.

The only good thing to come from tiktok and similar cancerous data gathering apps is that we now have millions of videos of cops beating people up.
I really questioned how the game was spelled for 30 seconds and then realized OP spelled it for me in the title
"It's not impossible for some kids hear the phrase ""Tik Tok"" before they hear ""Tic Tac Toe.""

I mean hell, I knew the game as Noughts and Crosses until I was like 18"
"Nah, Kesha got to them first."
A strange game.  The only winning move is not to play.

Hold up
Perhaps OP is a mail carrier.
"You don't? Gotta make sure their mail is secure and safe. It is your civic duty.

Maybe there is a package in there that needs to be secured."
Wanted dead or alive.
"Well, it could be worded correctly and not committing a felony if OP is a mail carrier."
"Kid does thing, parent takes photo, shares it somewhere, OP takes photo and posts it to Reddit, while not lying claiming it was their kid"
Not sure stealing pictures online is felony but yeah it should be.
Careful talking about Ouija boards on Reddit.  That's a occult stuff...
Nice... username.
Mail person is X. The kid wrote it at the top of the sheet.
Yeah x can't possibly win unless o throws it
let's be honest. It always ends in draw.
"This is exactly what I thought. That the ""weekend"" guy is going to come along and not even know if he's supposed to be X or O lol."

The child is the O.
"Pfft hey guys, come look at this fuckin n00b over here. Everyone point at laugh hahahaha"
"Center is technically 5th best optimal start, but only because there are 4 corners. If you count only 3 potential starting moves, it is 2nd best.  

If you haven’t already guessed, optimal is corner.  Optimal O start is center if X went corner, or corner if X went center.

If kid knows basics of “stopping 3 in a row”, now that we know first 2 moves, there is no way for X to win this round.

Only way for X to win when starting center is if O goes sides.

It is a completely solved game.  And not too hard to remember for the rest of your life once you learn the optimal moves."
?
Yep
"A good mail carrier always has a couple writing utensils on their person. Source, a mediocre mail carrier who asks to borrow a pen a lot."
"They don't really have time for it, but most of them really enjoy it."
or OP is the kid
Bottom right
"""X"" has already lost if the other ""O"" plays optimal. Tic Tac Toe is a game where the first player can always win or reach a draw if they play in an optimal way."
The rule is snitches get stitches!
"I believe it’s “mali people”

A short view back to ze past.
My mom is a post office supervisor but she delivers when she has to so I told her that she was a part time mail man. She said thank God its only part time otherwise you wouldn't have been born lol.
Yea mail carrier is a dick move in mail culture.

So there’s a chance that’s his kid?

"Technically correct, but you're supposed to downvote useless comments on Reddit."
Oh. I thought this was a comment on my post haha.
"The problematic thing with doing that is that reenforces the idea that men are the ""normal"", and women are the ""other"". It's better to have a neutral term that includes women, and not a special one just for women, because it holds an implication of separation. Or if you have a separate term for a woman in a profession, have one for men that is only used for men, as well as a neutral one. Personally, I'd prefer if there was an all encompassing neutral term for everything, because why is it important to destinguish the mail carrier's gender if it really doesn't matter?"

I started crying while telling my barista about it."

"Remove the ""for too long"" part and that's me"
But what if this is just your reaction to hugs for the past 10 years?
How is this funny?
"Hello, is this the line to get free hugs?"
Would you make “shh shh shh shh” noises and rock a little?
"funny thing.

yesterday I saw my friend and sister for the first time since the start of that Covid horror story arc.


Had to stop hugging cauz we started to cry a bit in front of the kids..."
Honestly same thing happened to me watching The Titan Games tonight. I bet Dwayne Johnson gives the best hugs
I got a hug the other day and I can still feel it. It’s like when you look at a light after being in a dark room and you keep seeing dots everywhere.
He's great! The recent buffering one is good stuff!
Is this dude the gamer president guy too?
Too much estrogen in your body. You should have that checked.
"It's a balance. Gotta let yourself feel your feelings, and acknowledge they're there, but also somehow keep it together most of the time."
Yeah but what a way to go. I'll take three.
"Phil is so depraved of human contact he is emotionally unstable. It's OK now to have mental illnesses and be vocal about it. Which means it's OK to make fun of them. Phil is doing that by himself, thus propagating the comedy in his tragedy. It helps him cope with his illness. We all look at the bright side of any situation."
Yes but its quite long. Take a number and have a seat please.
"Anything to make you cry, baby."
Username checks out
Yup
Why is too much estrogen a bad thing?
if i wait too long i will start crying
"Whoa whoa whoa, guys guys. We've all been waiting for our free hugs... together in the same place. Sooooo..."
That is debateable.
Too much of anything is bad for everybody. It's not like estrogen is poison. It's the levels that lead to chemical imbalances and fucks with your state of well-being.
"In men excessive estrogen can cause edema, high blood pressure, insomnia, reduced sex drive, and issues with mood and anxiety."
it causes bumbaclots and strokes according to google
That sentence sticks like no other.

I have had a ring of fire but it was not line this
I'm curious was the ring already black or is that just from the ash?
"So happy for you, sucks about the house though! - There's a certain attachment you have towards a wedding ring that unless you're married, you just don't understand. I'd be lost without mine."
Hang in there mate

I really hope you have an insurance. Losing your own house sucks. Good luck!
"So sorry about your house but  I guess the slim silver lining is that you found your ring.  Was it between floorboards or something? I've lost my engagement ring somewhere in my house,  I'll maybe not burn the house down looking for it though.  I hope you guys are all ok after the fire."
is your kitty okay?
Seems like an inefficient way to look for it.
The one ring to rule them all
ISIIIILDUUUUUUUR !
Look at the bright side.. the ring!
"Why did it burn up? Nobody hurt, right?"
 everyone in this post is just making jokes
Anyone else wondering why it wasn’t on his finger?
Did you also find your wife?
Hand and ring
Ring on hand
Gonna be good as new after a polish!
That's how we all find a wife.
You definitely got something that lasts. Sorry that your house burned up.
I read husband instead of house ..

Thats what she said
You're my hand doppelganger. Thought you'd want to know.

Honey!  GREAT news!!!
OP I think you must be mistaken. That ring is definitely still lost but luckily your home insurance will cover it ;)
A jeweler or an ultrasonic bath may be able to clean it up again.

"Seems like a bit of an extreme measure to find it, but I'm glad you found your ring!"
My home burned to the ground December 2010. Over the next few years I treasure hunted and did find gold jewelry - rings and necklaces and despite the jewelry looking burned it fetched quite a nice price when I took it to one of those “We buy Gold” places. The price of scrap gold was quite high at the time. Never did find my engagement ring and wedding ring (I always took them off at bedtime). Glad you found yours!
"They say that this is the proper way to start a marriage, with nothing but each other."
Oh it's the cat-jumping-out-of-the-house person!
The ring can be only destroyed by fires of Mordor.
A clickbait News headline: Man burned down his house to find the lost wedding ring.
"Sorry about your house, but good find!  

Btw, how big was the spider?"
thats cool dude. just pick another wife
"As someone who has lost EVERYTHING in a house fire, this is an amazing find! I’m sure it helps with all of the grief you are dealing with.

Burninf down your house just to find a ring? That's dedication.
Forged in the fires of Mt Doom
Precious.....
A house fire won’t work.  The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom. Only there can it be unmade. The ring must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came.
Super surprised that did not melt.  Gold has a pretty low melting temperature

Did your girlfriend find out about your wife and torch your house? Or vice versa?
r/wellthatsucks
Just had to find that ring.. Not even a house will get in your way.
and why again was your house build out of wood?
The engagement ring. The wedding ring. Now the firing
It appears that it started the fire
Throw it back into the fire in which it came!

"Did elvish lettering appear when you picked it up?

Btw....sorry about your house man."
This is a start of a new quest.... mostly the quest to find a new home. Sorry about your house.
I couldn't imagine trying to go to that spot in your room even though the whole things burned down I'm trying to find the jewelry box on the dresser and search around in the ashes..
"I came here to say this, thankenu"
"CAST IT INTO THE FIRE

Did you find any diamonds? I heat they burn but that may be myth?
should've called your mom before you burnt it down
Plot twist and Irony - His wife burnt it down.
Did it by any chance reveal any strange letters when you picked it up from burning ashes?
"Our area has recently been bushfire affected. I was speaking with a woman who lost her home and the thing she was most worried about was a small wooden jewellery box with her wedding ring (she’s a widow), and her mother and grandmother’s wedding rings. She went back to the charred remains of her house, went to approximately the place where her bedroom and bedside table used to be, kicked around in the ashes and would you believe it, there is was. It was all charred up and the metal hinges had melted, but she opened it up and there were the rings in almost perfect condition. A little bit out of shape from having melted a bit, but definitely salvageable. I honestly think that finding those rings saved that poor woman’s sanity. She would have been emotionally destroyed from all the other trauma if she’d lost them."
"Well, I guess it can only be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom."
I am titaaaaaniiiiium

I thought you were cosplaying Frodo from LOTR. Peace xD
Keep it secret..... Keep it safe
Silver Lining
Were there some kind of weird written characters that appeared on it when still hot? Because someone might want to get that back
I keep my wedding ring in a firebox 100 percent of the time.
What material is it made of? I assume a gold ring would have melted into a puddle unless it was in a cooler space of the fire....
U were supposed to take it to Mordor

No no you can’t destroy the ring with a regular fire.

"Seems you're going to need more than a house fire to melt that down, may I suggest a volcano?"
Every cloud has a sooty lining
You always find it in the last place you look.
I know im only 18 but holy fuck isn't it scary to have a piece of metal that's thousands of dollars on your finger???? I'd never wear a ring if I get married. But then again I doubt if get married lol
It was the only way to find the ring!
The spiders are not sorry.
His wife was teaching him a lesson for going out of the house without it.

This just made me emotional. My ex fiancé stole my engagement ring out of my purse to sell it for heroin. I was in love with that thing.
I can't wear one at work plus I take it off to handle raw meats when cooking.
A lot of jobs it's a safety hazard to wear any jewelery
I seem to be the only one wondering why his house burned down.
My grandpa always refused to wear his ring at work after he saw one of his friends get degloved.
some people don't like wearing rings around their finger. my husband wears his ring on a necklace.
"Probably on his nightstand. I normally only put mine on when I get ready to go out. Since I've been in quarantine, I have barely been wearing it, not for any particular reason, though. I would venture to say most married people don't just wear their ring all the time."
I take my off all the time for work or if I’m doing something messy. I didn’t pick a diamond so my stone is too soft to wear sometimes.
It wasn't on his finger coz he lost it?!
Not at all. Almost never where mine because I cant wear it at work. I'm assuming the same is true for OP.
I don't sleep with my rings on. Neither does my husband. They go in a dish on the nightstand every night. Perhaps the fire happening at night and he'd taken it off.

"Thanks, dad."
I wear a tungsten one that is around 100 dollars.  You dont have to have an expensive ring for it to look nice....
"Usually engagement rings are expensive but wedding rings/bands are a bit cheaper, partially for the reason you stated."
"You could get married and not get the rings. Unless you and your spouse are religious, there's no reason to stick to traditions. Hell where I live people don't even bother to get married, since there's no tax advantage."
"That's what insurance is for!

But seriously, yes, it's scary at first but you kind of get used to it after a bit. I know many people have alternate rings for daily wear too. Because of his work, my husband wears a silicon ring. I've seen him wear his actual wedding band less than 5 times in the 2 years we've been married."
"You know, you don't have to conform to this (IMHO financially irresponsible) tradition. You don't have to do something just cause previous generation did it."
"It is scary lol, I'm 34 and married for 4 years and typically I only wear my wedding ring because it was $200 or so.  My husband wears a $35 silicone groove ring that's actually more expensive than the other couple bands we bought for him to try.

Also, finger shape matters. My knuckles are not wide so I have to wear my ring a little tight so it can't slip off but my husband has to get a ring big enough to get over his knuckle then it's looser."

Everything you've said here applies to the Great British Bake Off, too.

Prue Leith used to be a ninja."
My coworker was on Forged in Fire. He didn’t win but said it was a fun experience
"Anyone who works in a physical industry or hobby tends to not wear rings.
Very very easy to catch it on something and remove the finger.
Not even a joke."
"I have no idea why OP wasn’t, but there are many reasons you may take it off. Personally I don’t always like to wear mine when I’m cooking, and especially when I’m baking, which is an appropriate time for a house to burn down."
"Honestly I take my wedding ring off at night, when running on the treadmill, when taking a shower, and when preparing meat \[I always put it on my bedside table but we have those animal ring holders in the bathroom, bedroom and kitchen \]. Pre-Covid I was pretty good at remembering to put it on in the morning but Post-Covid I'm home most of the day and sometimes don't even realize I'm not wearing my ring until half the day is gone.

My wife does pretty much the same thing but has always worked from home so has always been haphazard about it. I find it funny when we go to my in-laws house and they notice she forgot to wear her ring while I'm proudly sporting mine. Honestly I don't think she wore it at all most of March-May and I just noticed her starting to wear it again maybe a week ago."
Because he was cheating on his wife while she started the fire.
I switched to silicone even though I have a gold ring after a bike accident. Thank god i wasn’t wearing my rings that day because I would have had to cut them off. It took a year before I could even wear them comfortable again and I never got back into the habit of wearing them. Now I just wear a small silicone band pretty much the time.
Wym? He lost it in the house. Found it after fire
"I stopped wearing mine after a year or so. I’m Italian so I use a lot of hand jestures. The amount of times that ring has gone flying off my finger is too many to count. Plus I weight lift and have small kids, wearing a ring all the time can get dangerous. I only really wear it when I’m either at a fancy occasion or on a business trip. Usually though I’ll keep it in my pocket."
"My wife and I always remove our rings at night to sleep. We have a box for them. Summer nights get crazy hot here and I've woken up on more than one occasion with my finger circulation getting cut off. Trust me, depending on the temp, whether my hands are dry or cold or hot, the ring can come off and back on very easily, i can twist it and barely feel it's there, or i have to use soap to get it off."
His wife probably burned it down
">Doom

Indeed.

Which one? The fiancé or the ring?
Wow
"Thieves, they stole it from us.
Precious!"
"my buddy was putting on skis and snowboards on his SUV, caught the ring and degloved his ring finger.  

he took a picture, OMG it was disgusting.  he got it amputated, then he just had surgery to close the pinky in so he can grip sans a hole.  he's got 3 fingers and thumb now, and it almost looks normal

don't google 'degloving human parts' if you've not heard of it!"
Like firefighter?
I wear a silicone band for this reason.  Like three bucks for a dozen on Amazon.
"I've only taken it off twice in 11 years.  Both times it felt weird not being on my finger so I put it back on again within a minute.

It's the same sensation as not wearing my watch. My wrist feels naked without it."
Mine hasn’t left my finger in 9 years.
*insert explosion*
"Damn it, beat meat to it."
"Thanks, dad.
I am The Dad"
"I wear one of those silicone rings that cost like 20 bucks.

I do have a ""nice"" ring though.   Just a gold band thats been in my family for a long time."
"Tungsten rings are not so wise. Tungsten is a very hard metal. If your finger is injured it can swell and the ring can act as a tourniquet. Soft precious metal and even titanium rings can easily be removed in the hospital with a ring cutter. 

Tungsten is so hard and difficult to cut through that wearers often lose their finger."
"Mine's gold and it was less than a thousand. Typically men's rings don't have stones or anything and even the precious metals ones aren't crazy expensive. 

My wife's engagement ring + wedding band is a set and platinum with diamonds but it was my grandmother's who left it to me when she died so it was free less some small repairs."

I imagine it like *tik tik tik tik tik*
4-5 of the top comments are all Lord of the ring references
"I work in a prosthetics and orthotics lab and can attest to many leaving rings off. 

I also haven’t worn mine for the last 2.5 months thanks to our newborn daughter. I saw a small bruise right in the middle of her back at an early pediatrician visit... then realized I had been ring-beating her every time I tried to burp her. (My ring is also hefty tungsten-carbide.)"
"Yup. I always ask clients if they are working with heavy machinery, if so, go with ceramic. It will shatter and keep your finger from degloving. A lot of people have a ""real"" ring and get a cheap silicone one to wear to work."
Doent even have to be your hobby or job. Can be an everyday accident. A friend of mine climbed over a fence and his ring got caught at the top. Ripped his finger off. Another friend lost his finger when jumping off the back of a truck and had his ring caught on the edge.
Devolving your finger or having it ripped off is not something you want to mess with.
"Even just professional cooking. Plenty of people do wear their wedding rings because the health department doesn't ban them (any other rings are banned, think they don't want to upset the traditionalists), but really it's just gross."
Dont forget people like me who fidget with everything and have a talent for losing shit. I could totally manage to lose a wedding band
Saw someone before who got their ring caught on a banister walking down some stairs and it ripped their finger off!
"I play guitar, no way am i scraping a peice if metal up and down the neck and scratching it all up."
"Same here. I wear my ring on nice occasions like a date, birthday, anniversary, church, etc. but other than that I wear silicone. Way cheaper, more comfortable, and the symbolism is there."
Not as fun as IDKFA
Hmmm cake!
The alarm went off by turning on.
Happy first cake day!!
Sure gives new meaning to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJxrX42WcjQ).
The heroin.
"My brother-in-law and nephew (2 different people) saw a guy casually return a tennis ball over a tall fence and catch his wedding ring on the top, degloving his finger and ripping the tendon out from the 'root' in the process. Must have been utterly horrifying. 

The guy was a concert pianist as it turned out."
So a Simpsons hand then
So I didn’t know what degloving meant and I googled it because I hadn’t read your warning yet and went on pictures and I swear to god please don’t do that.
"Oh fuck....nice way to provoke me.
And others reading this.....DON'T GO SEARCHING FOR IT."
My ring has curved edges so it is smooth. Do you think that would save my finger from being degloved? I’m not sure if it’s the cutting from the ring itself or the force of it pulling on your skin that does the job.
You obviously don’t have a job where it’s a safety hazard. Just read a few of the other comments and you’ll see why not everybody can just wear it all the time.
"Some people choose to do that. People have different habits. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong or unusual, though, with someone taking their ring off."
You probably should take it off and wash your finger.
Mine hasn't for 19+....
*Michael Bay intesifies*
You didnt specify what sort of explosion
If that's how you like to get your rocks off.
"Those are awesome!  I dont like them b/c of oil and brake clean.... if I have to take it off what's the point?

I waited until I was 32.  I'm glad I did, only one of my friends is still married.  100% wait until late 20s."
"I got married at 19 and it has been a struggle. You dont know anyone at that age on a mature enough level to marry them. I am very fortunate that my husband and I just happened to be compatible in the long run, but not without lots of tears and yelling as we learned to adjust from focusing on ourselves to another human. Just wait, and dont stress it at all youll be glad you did."
"Tungsten carbide is brittle, it can be shattered easily with a pair of vice grips."
I believe you have tungsten and titanium mixed up. Tungsten can be shattered easily. Titanium cannot and is also extremely difficult to cut.

As much as they are nice and different than the usual gold alloy, these rings are dangerous: EMTs and firefighters cannot cut them with the usual tools at their tools, leading to the loss of fingers if they have to be removed."
"We just went with silicone rings from the outset and decided to put the value in the concept instead of the ring (for when they eventually give up the ghost). It’s been a few days shy of a year since we got married and we still have our original rings, but bought a second set that looks cooler.

"Tungsten can be shattered though, pretty easily too. My father-in-law is an EMT and he told me the same thing."
"You only need a pair of vice grips.

With enough force applied they simply shatter into several pieces with no harm done to the finger."
"For anyone wondering this is the breakdown of how long it takes to cut various metals off your finger. 

http://www.fresno.ucsf.edu/em/posters/snowdenposter2010.pdf

Basically the standard ring metals (silver, gold, platinum) are all very easy and take a few minutes at most. The more modern stuff can take much longer or be impossible to cut."
"They know about them now. All it takes is a pair of vice grips to crack them. Tungsten carbide is brittle.

But don't try wearing a hardened steel bearing race as a ring, apparently that is still an issue. (My reddit & Google-fu have both failed me, but there was someone a couple weeks ago that did that and they sent him home with it still in his finger. Took a couple of days for the swelling to go down before he got it loose)."
That's just regurgitation of something someone told you in the past. It's not the case anymore and hasn't been for a long time. Tungsten-carbide is brittle and can easily be shattered. EMTs and other emergency folks know how to break them.

"I believe that Gandalf is really Manwe, chief of the gods, the Valar. And I believe that Manwe is actually a representation of Eru, Tolkien’s concept of God. I believe that Tolkien was going for a very christological model in all of this and that Gandalf is a Christ figure. I believe that this is exemplified by the fact that Gandalf was able to command the Eagles just as Manwe did in the Simirillion. And also this is included in the fact that all of the Istari, the wizards, failed in their mission because they were lesser Ainur. Eru basically knew that he was the only one that could save his creation and so he came to Arda, or the earth, as an incarnation of himself to save it. His Christ-like death was at Kahzadum."

Ensorings.com has really nice ones and they’re inexpensive. I bought two to swap out. I’m not a ring person because my hands swell a lot when I run. A silicone ring was the middle ground my partner and I agreed on because they can stretch a bit.
"Yeah but we don’t carry around vice grips, we carry ring cutters. I’m not saying we can’t add vice grips. Just that until it becomes standard practice you’re risking your fingers."
It takes 3 minutes to cut through a gold ring? I'm pretty sure bolt cutters can cut through that in one snip.
"For the lazy: 

> The electric ring cutter and the Dremel cut modern hard  metal rings made of titanium and stainless steel that the  manual ring cutter could not cut. None of the cutting  methods used were able to cut tungsten carbide, however, tungsten carbide is brittle, it was easily shattered with a light tap of a hammer.

Mine is titanium, mostly because it was much cheaper than gold but could be laser engraved and it didn't get all banged up super fast like a silver one would. I'll have to be careful :("
Thanks!
"While that would be incredible, really, you just don't fret the strings with the very base of your ring finger. There's no reason to do that unless you have teeny tiny hands."

HONEY NOOOOOOO
"Gandalf was not Manwe. Gandalf's original name was *Olórin.* He was a Maia who often walked unseen among elves under various names and was often considered the wisest of the Maiar. He served many of the Valar, including Manwe, but primarily served another called Nienna

He was sent by Manwe and the Valar as a whole to Middle Earth along with four other Maia, Radagast (also know as *Aiwendil***)** and Saruman (also know as *Curunír*) and two other unnamed Maia who became the blue wizards"
"If anyone is Eru in LOTR it's Tom Bombadil. The ring doesn't affect him in the least, whereas Gandalf fears it's corrupting powers. Bombadil refers to himself as the eldest and that he existed before the first raindrops or acorns. Nothing in the world frightens him he is more powerful than the barrow wight, the Nazgul, and probably the Istari or Sauron.  His power may even come from song much like the way in which Eru led the Valar in chorus to create existence. Towards the end of LOTR Gandalf plans on having a long visit and unexplained visit with Bombadil, again suggesting he is important. Tolkien said in a letter that Bombadil wasn't important to the narrative if LOTR but that he represents something important, beyond that though, he was rather nebulous about who or what Bombadil really was."
"This guy Tolkiens.

But all joking aside, I agree."
Found Stephen Colbert's account.
"You should read The Silmarillion. It’s a fascinating book. Also check out The Prancing Pony podcast. They go very in-depth into Tolkien’s universe, starting with The Silmarillion and going into his other books from there. 

Gandalf definitely isn’t Manwe but he is a Maiar named Olorin."
"Legend has it that Tolkien was inspired by Hogsback in South Africa.  In the local Afrikaans language, Earth translates to ‘Aarde’ ( phonetically Arrh-duh).  I would propose this is where the name Arda originated from"
I pressed pause on my life to pop into Reddit.

Does Stephen Colbert have a reddit account? Clearly this needs his input to resolve.
Make sure to read “Unfinished Tails” which are filled with Tolkien’s notations as he created his works. There is a note in it we’re Tolkien talks about Olorin actually being Manwe instead and Christopher calls it “fascinating.”
"Their names were actually Alatar and Pallando. They traveled to the east as missionaries to help reverse the influence that Sauron had in those lands, where they later received the names Morinehtar and Rómestámo. Though they are not mentioned in the LotR movie trilogy, there is actually one part during the Two Towers where you can tell they failed in their mission. During the Black Gate scene where Sam falls down the mountainside, the soldiers that are marching through the gates, that Sam and Frodo have to hide from, are from the lands to the east."
"Exactly.  Bombadil is one of my most favorite parts of Tolkien's work.  I see Bombadil as a pre-Christ ... well, Christ.  It's like in Genesis when Abraham ""meets God,"" and three guys show up ... I mean, trinity!  Tolkien knew what he was doing.  I cannot prove this, but I believe Bombadil is Tolkien's ""theophany"" ... so-to-speak.  Indeed, of all the creatures who experience The One Ring in LoTR, Bombadil is beyond immune to it.  He laughs at it, toys with it, and makes *it* disappear!!!  Bombadil is like God on Mount Horeb in the OT: raw power.  Gandalf is like Christ in the NT: veiled power, masked power ... sacrificial power.  Gandalf is power that has given up its power to die for the world: a true Christ archetype.

Edit: /In Ian McKellen Voice: r/downvotesreally ?!?"
Tolkien disagrees.
Or 5 arms and 3 legs
Or read the Silmarillion (and have your head both explode and implode at the same time)
"So you posted that long paragraph about all the reasons you theoretically believe Gandalf was Manwe all the while knowing Tolkien came right out and said it in print? Cool, cool cool cool."
"I mean, that basically flies in the face of what was actually published in LOTR and Silmarillion where it more or less states that Gandalf is someone else. Tolkien had a lot of internal edits and revisions of his work so this may have been true in an earlier or later version"
"Got to concur. Bombadil is so far above any of the trifling issues of Middle Earth that even the Ring is nothing more than a toy. It's like Middle Earth is nothing more than ants, and he's human.

He could have easily stopped the war of the Ring with barely a thought, but why would a man have a quarrel with an ant?"
Tolkien’s not doing much of anything these days.

What is up with the uniformity of everyday wear?
"almost looks like a cartoon, since you can't see anybody's faces"
That's two different people missing a leg in two different scenes. Was this a common thing back then?
All the pleople in this video are dead now. No exceptions. Spooky
Nobody mentioning the guy who noticed the camera and was in absolute awe and awkwardly started circling around to gawk at this future technology.
Bet this guy couldn't even comprehend that what he was filming would be digitized and then viewed by thousands of people one hundred years later all holding interconnected screens in their hands.
I love how the streets were for people.
"I would really be fascinated to see video of candid conversations from far in the past

There’s such a Hollywood-ified version of contemporary speech that I would be fascinated to hear what it really sounded like. It’s hard for me to imagine what normal talking sounded like, with all the stuttering and accidental interruptions, but with the slang and style of the time."

"1911 was the year Brooklyn's baseball team took on the name ""Trolley Dodgers"" because fans would dodge trolleys on the way to games. That name was used 1911-1912. In 1932 they took on the name again but shortened it to Dodgers."

You know, I bet few established  industries have collapsed as fast as the hat industry. 



I remember seeing a photo from just before Kennedy was elected and of the several hundred men in the crowd, every single one has a hat on. 

Then you see a crowd just 10 years later and *not one single man* has a hat.

I could go to the corner drugstore and get a couple vials of heroin and cocaine.  Get a steak dinner and a piece of ass for a silver dollar too.

What are the chances of this video spawning?
I knew it wouldn't be true audio seeing as talkies hadn't been invented yet but the sound of the horse at 0:50 or so is literally the sound effect that the Stable makes in Age of Empires 2.
I wish I could time travel
Nice find
Don't really get the degradation of society bit by racists. Plenty of Black people and immigrants loved dressing in this type of attire too. Trashy Whites morphed modern society imo.
I can't believe hats were a thing.
Just imagine walking around the streets and possibly stepping on horse shit.

First thing I noticed was how normal and slowly everyone seemed to be walking. Because in old videos it always seemed sped up giving everyone frantic movements.
Is the sound real? It seems unlikely that there would be film with sound at that time but maybe it's possible?
How the fuck is it “rare” it’s on the internet. I’ve seen this for years
How many of these men/boys went of to war and never came back
So much hats
What would they think if we told them in the future women sometimes wear pajamas out and during covid-19 they stopped wearing bras?
"Everyone, even the guys on crutches has impeccable posture. It’s incredible how dated just something like walking gait can be"

Alright who’s going to be the first to find the time traveler making a call on his cellphone?
The hat wearing was for a similar reason to modern masks. In this case the hats reduced the spread of headlice.
"I was thinking about that too! There's like, an actual uniform to being a human in New York in 1911, well, a for a man anyway, can't see many women in the video."
"Less evolved fashion business. You have less trends, less styles, less tailors, less creativity, less everything. Basically yes, “business uniform” is a thing, and well, still a thing- people wear dark suit and tie for such jobs."
Clothing was really expensive.  Most people only owned a few pairs of clothing and so it would make sense to wear your suit everyday.
"It’s not so bad being trendy, everyone who looks like me is my friend"
"I can't figure out how they keep those hats on.  One gust of wind and whoosh!

Also, the last time I was in NYC (in the 90s), everyone was pretty well dressed the same, too (save tourists): black slacks, black coat, black shoes.  No color."
It's like there's a time when you become a man where you turn in your newsboy hat and earn your boater hat.
I actually see a variety.
People didn't know you were a white supremist unless you wore one of those hats.
"The fast-fashion industry is a relatively recent invention, just like fast-food."
"not much, what's up with you?"
"Probably has a lot to do with cost/methods of refining textiles. The development of synthetic fabrics like nylon didn't take off for about 10 years after this video, and polyester wasnt for another 30 years.

Almost all of the fabrics in their wear here were wool or cotton, and maybe a few silks. These garments don't have the wide range of applications that synthetics do, and dyes were also a bit of an expensive commodity. Although the black and white doesn't really assist in determining the possibilities of color."
It's so surreal. Seems like a movie since we've all only ever seen movies portraying this. Hard to comprehend that this was an actual day someone filmed.
Everyone is off going somewhere. Busy busy...

"It's sad to think these people had World War I and a pandemic to look forward to at this time, basically they were lucky if they reached World War II."

"Civil war vets, they would be mostly in 50-60s at this time. Many many of them lost limbs"
You should visit India.
Civil War. [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/lifeandlimb/maimedmen.html](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/lifeandlimb/maimedmen.html) 3/4 of all operations during the Civil War were amputations.
"Tried to research this but came up with nothing, I’m stumped."
Pre-OSHA. Being maimed (or worse) at work was commonplace. Civil war was just fought. Medicine was poor. Things were wild only 100 years ago
Amputation was more common many years ago because of a lack of medical knowledge and technical means.
"Isn’t it weird how in 130 years, everyone alive right now will be dead and there will be 11 billion new people populating the earth?

This has been the cycle of humanity for hundreds of thousands of years and it’s absolutely mind blowing to me. I am nothing."
What’s even more spooky is that we walk the same street they did. We live in the same houses they did.
Actually someone born in 1903 is still alive. Maybe they visited New York while this was filmed.
Is it me or did that dude look like Joseph Gordon-Levitt?
Timestamp?
"I was scrolling for this comment. He’s adorable! And here we are so many years later, seeing him like someone interrupting a news broadcast."
"What I noticed that no one pointed out was everyone’s posture is really good.  Without computers, desk jobs, and driving in cars all day, it looks like walking and standing helps build good posture."
They were only made silly thanks to the edgy type of enlightened atheist wearing them
"I think about this when looking at dinosaur footprints—just some random step that a random creature took on a random day and thanks to the conditions being perfect, it became preserved. Try to comprehend that: An inconsequential split-second of your life being preserved for millennia."
Maybe the memories of our lives will be digitized and made for consumption by immersive VR devices a hundred years from now.
"That was not just ""digitized"" it was [put through][1] some [very powerful AI][2] where neural nets filled in data between original frames creating a more natural effect. This technology was probably beyond even science fiction writers at that time.

"Absolutely yes.  The modern concept of ""jaywalking"" had yet to be invented.  Until the 1920's legally it was the responsibility of the carriage driver to avoid pedestrians, not the other way around.  When the streets became the exclusive property of vehicles is when cities began their 20th century decline."
"Exactly my thought, hope we get back there soon."
"Clothes were expensive but made to last longer. People had less clothes because there was no reason to have more. Now with different trends you can have same clothing pieces of same quality and same materials but one priced $5 and other $500. 

Back in the day fancy overpriced stuff barely existed. In some countries never existed at all until 50s.

A good friend of mine owns a vintage clothing store, and I bought a suit jacket made in the 30s, Harris Tweed, made from Scottish wool. It’s almost 100 years old and it looks like it will last 300 more. The quality of those thongs is remarkable- the attention to detail, the material, seams- everything. The history of material- you can trace tweed to families that ran the business and produced it for hundreds of years. 

It’s very hard to go back to your H&M and Zara and stuff and not feel depressed.

Edit: [my 90 y.o. jacket](https://imgur.com/a/FvDJE3U)"
"People generally had fewer clothes that were made to last longer. The majority of people who were working professionals had a work suit, and a Sunday best formal affairs suit. 
  
At home you'd have like... basic stuff. Maybe a pair of jeans, some yard work pants, and then those coveralls that you always see. And that was pretty much it. People could pretty much fit everything they owned clothing wise into one closet."
"The very technology that made this clip possible—cinema—is one of the main reasons. 

Back in the day, most people never really left their hometown. If you don’t ever leave, you don’t really see new fashions other than what everyone around you is wearing. Local merchants (and they were nearly ALL local, mass-produced mass-marketed clothing was relatively new and still out of reach) saw no reason to deviate from the same clothing trends year to year, because what competition did they have? Nobody was going to stop buying clothes from the one or two local retailers. 

But in comes cinema, and now even the people in Peoria can see clothes that look new and interesting. Local merchants realize they can gain an edge if they start selling clothes more similar to what Gloria Swanson or Rudolph Valentino wore in their last pictures.

Then mass merchants realize “wait a minute, we can mass produce clothes and sell them all over the country.” (This is already going on at roughly the time this clip was taking place—New York had a sizable garment industry.) And they do so, and in an effort to gain an edge over one another they market them in films and print advertisements—and, as the cycle perpetuates into the 20th century, television. 

These mass-merchants also realize that to get people to buy their clothes over others, they can also bring the price point down—meaning clothes that are more “in style” can be cheaper than older fashions, or fashions reserved for special occasions. This becomes *especially* true after the cultural revolutions of the 1960s and 70s; post-baby boomer dominated western culture is *distinctly* more casual in all forms than pre-JFK eras. Someone in 1940 wearing just a t-shirt and pants would be seen like how we see someone wearing only underwear or (more probably) PJs today, for example—trashy, low class, “can’t they afford anything better?” Whereas nowadays, something like wearing a suit to anything other than a formal event or a job interview is seen as weird—doubly so in the fashion-forward west coast, where wearing a suit to an interview might get you laughed out of the room by a CEO clad in flip flops and a hoodie. 

The cycle goes ever-increasingly faster as companies and designers try to one-up another quicker and quicker. And you end up with today, where an influencer on Insta or TikTok wearing a unique shirt or jacket can suddenly spring thousands of companies into producing identical copies of it."
Maybe the original one from that video.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aohXOpKtns0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aohXOpKtns0)
"Damn, that’s super rare. Only, like, 7 people have access to YouTube."
Almost walks into the one-leg guy.
"I counted two women in the same shot. One is walking in the background with a man and right before the shot ends, another woman with a man is seen crossing the camera."
Would've gotten Bingo if it had been a double amputee woman
Yeah... :/
Right - it’s all men! The only woman I saw was arm and arm with a man. Where are the ladies?
"Watch the whole video, women are everywhere and many are by themselves / not accompanied by men.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ1OgQL9_Cw&feature=youtu.bel"
Or men without hats?
"I love that history has become so distorted, revised and politicised that you genuinely think that might be true"
Boomers began the comfort > fashion trend.
"Probably, the audio is just mixed together stock audio.  This was recorded without sound."
You're probably correct.
"The stable sound, yep. The audio in this video is entirely fabricated from stock sounds."
"Definitely saw a couple fatties in there. Less than usual though.

"Gary Taubes talks about this in The Case Against Sugar. Whatever the reason, obesity and diabetes were rare back then. Someone looked through the records of a Philadelphia hospital and in some years only found one case of diabetes in a year, despite the fact that they knew what i was back then.

There are several possible reasons, but for one, food was more expensive back then. We didn't have the mass-scale, mechanized, industrial farming we have now. Poor people were skinny and being fat was actually like a status symbol because you practically had to be rich (in general, not exclusively). Whole foods were the norm, for the most part, and over-processed foods that have low nutrition & higher glycemic index (much more common today) were not so available. Putting sugar and high fructose into practically everything (also common nowadays) didn't exist yet. Ironically, nowadays, obesity is a much greater risk for poor people than starvation. We now have mass quantities of cheap, low nutrition food."
"There’s a video from this era of San Francisco and the only fat person is a cop, who looks like the most stereotypical push-broom-moustached police constable ever."
And still some people blame it on genetics. I don't know anyone of my grandparents generation that was obese.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ1OgQL9_Cw
Is the sound added in or is this the real sound?
enhances the experience
"Nobody’s leaning their neck down looking at their phone, and nobody’s slouched on a couch gaming or binge watching tv for hours on end"
"Yes, there was no color motion picture film in those days. It's possible that the audio recording is not real as well. Films didn't generally have sound until the late 1920s, so either this audio was recorded separately (seems unlikely) or this was foleyd in by someone."
Oh really? But everyone already had a hat. Maybe now is the time. No one is wearing a hat. Think of the earning potential.
If this is the middle of the work day there would be no reason to be outside because they didn't have jobs.
They had less rights and opportunities outside of the kitchen.
"They wore hats to reduce the spread of headlice, just as we're wearing masks to reduce the spread of covid."
"One of my history teachers put it this way, “Wherever there are horses, there is horse shit—lot's of it.” Not to mention that with all of the horses, there would be a decent number of dying horses, and no quick way to get rid of them."
Idk it for a fact but I'm  sure we werent  very welcome in that part of town
"Let's also remember that these people possibly bathed once a week and wore that suit the entire week--they alternated collars and cuffs, so they probably looked great and smelled terrible."
Can you imagine wearing that during summer? It's a no for me.
Nobody is stopping you to wear suit all the time. I think you care too much of how people think of you.
Hello my dapper dude
"This is such a common but untrue trope. Because of nostalgia we tend to think the past must have been simpler and more enjoyable.

But you are forgetting that these people lack antibiotics and many basic healthcare necessities we take for granted. As a result, cholera, typhus, smallpox, polio, and other horrific diseases regularly spread through the cities and country in deadly epidemics. Children were especially susceptible; most families lost at least one child until the mid 20th century. 

If you were lucky enough to survive to adulthood life was hard; most people were laborers or farmhands, and they worked far more hours than we do today. They also had virtually no labor protections. Children often worked dangerous jobs as well, and if you were unfortunate enough to lose a finger in a sawmill the most you might get out of it is a couple days off.

If you were fortunate enough to make it to old age after a lifetime of horrific diseases, hard work, and excessive violence (more commonplace back then - see ""The Better Angels of Our Nature"" - Steven Pinker) you had better hope you saved up well. There was no social security for you, and the elderly often lived in extreme poverty.

The point I'm making is be careful not to romanticize the past. We are very lucky to live in the time we do. The problems we have are minuscule compared to back then."
"You’d probably be too young to have to fight in WWI, but you’d face the Spanish Flu pandemic and be the age it most effected before you got there"
"as long as you weren't a irish, italian, catholic, jewish ,colored, or a women, then hell yeah it might have been ok"
Pros and cons
You can find clips of the Hindenburg going up in flames everywhere. But it's the same handful.
The Spanish flu hit a few years after this video was taken. They had pandemics too.
Why? Todays life is easier than ever before
Probably a good chance - the last undisputed veteran of the US Civil War died in 1956.
"Don't know the why, but the way I heard it said, men's hats fell out of fashion in the lead-up to the 1960 US presidential election - Kennedy apparently preferred not to wear hats, appeared on camera not wearing one, and suddenly the hat market for men collapsed."
No idea
How about just trashy people?
They had colour then...however I think this has been colourised as newsreel were rarely shot on colour film as it was expensive.
"Also because sunscreen didn't exist, I'd guess. Don't want your face skin to burn."
"Wow TIL, thanks!"
What!?! I've never heard that before
"Is this an actual fact? Hats wouldn't have helped stopping the spread of head lice since they don't jump - it's spread by contact.  They can't survive  off the host for very long, but sharing of hats would have spread more than wearing it as a preventative.  Unless you mean that was a perceived truth at the time(but wrong)?"
"Genuine question, was that the original purpose of hats? Or did it turn into that?  I always thought it was a fashion item. I also know that during the 1800 there was a period were you were considered a lunatic if you went out without a hat. Maybe my assumption is based on that."
<CITATION NEEDED>
They weren't invented yet.
Total sausage fest....and all women were accompanied by a man (even the little girl was being handheld by a boy).
There's a woman in the beginning wearing a giant hat
"I think I prefer that option. Less pollution. Less mass-produced bullshiza.

Then again, I'm a fashion coward."
Please don’t hate me because I’m trendy.
In Japan people wear very similar clothes.
"Is it possible for you to upscale this?

Edit: There is one! See /u/Rafapex's comment below"
"Noise was dubbed in. Wasnt recorded with audio, makes it feel more immersive."
"I feel like godfather 2, during the flashbacks, is so well done that we’re actually watching a window through time."
"I get the same exact feeling from it and that’s what I find so fascinating.  Since we generally only see actors portraying people from that time period, seeing the real thing is like literally looking through a window into the past through a time machine.

Kind of hard to really explain, but seeing the mundane moments in the real lives of the people, simple things like that one guy carrying the box, the dude noticing and standing in front of the camera, the guy adjusting his jacket, etc.  It makes you think about all the mundane things we do everyday in comparison and just makes it all the more real.

I love it.  It makes a distant past clear and accessible."
I had an ancestor who lost his leg because of an infected ingrown toenail. Antibiotics didn’t come along until the 1940s.
"So I briefly looked into some records from London (albeit 50 years prior)
And there are quite a few amputations
 It reads...

Of the 84 amputations performed as consequence of trauma, 72 were necessitated by injuries sustained at work—for instance, ‘being run over by a railway car’, being ‘crushed between two ships’ or being 'injured by machinery's

While it's quite possible that there were surviving civil war vets or even a handful of Spanish American, this was kinda the height of the industrial revolution with the lowest form of safety regulations.

The next biggest causes of amputations in these London hospitals were illness such as osteomyelitis, cancer, and gangrene."
"Spanish American War would have been the most recent conflict, in 1898."
Yeah I'm guessing the Civil War would have had a huge impact on seeing amputees in public.  They were common practice on the battlefield.
I think you’re pulling his leg.
"That one kid who stopped to stare at the camera got me. Like, your adult years are gonna be rough if you make it!"
Could be the same for us. I'm not too optimistic about our future atm.
Gunna be an interesting next year or two for us. Hope history doesn't repeat itself
They probably didn't realise that life was hard.
"Yeah, I wonder how those people will view the videos with us in that time. Supposing there will not be some other form of entertainment that will make videos obsolete"
"I for one plan on outliving you all. 

You all, I say!"
"Only Queen Elizabeth II will be there, the only one who can outlive this generation."
"[*Low and high fertility scenarios put a large band around the numbers -- from 3.6 billion persons in 2150 to 27 billion in 2150.*](https://www.un.org/press/en/1998/19980202.POP656.html#:~:text=Low%20and%20high%20fertility%20scenarios,to%2027%20billion%20in%202150.)"
"I think the majority will be dead, but you’re telling me there aren’t some kids alive right now that won’t live to 140? I think there are some scientists that believe the first people that will live to 1000 have already been born."
130 years doesn’t even seem like a lot for a whole new generation of humans
"There will not be I promise you that.  Oh we will all be dead, but in a hundred years, I wouldn't be surprised if the worlds population is under 1 billion."
The oldest person alive right now is living with a completely different planet of people than when they were born.
Isn't it 7 billion?
Probably a lot more people or a lot less
Welcome to stoicism!
I would like to see the appreciation on some of those old NYC homes.
I’m not a religious person but I believe the dead are around us in some form. Everyone in this vid is still wandering the streets of NYC... in the twilight zone dun dun dun
Quick they're onto us
Looper shit
I would watch this episode of black mirror
"Thank God this ended, traffic and commutes would be absolutely horrendous"
"We won't get there until people quit liking to drive, it's completely unreasonable to allow people the same use of the road as a car who's allowed to go 40mph"
"Aye but don't forget all the crap stuff from that period has been thrown away already. That suit was probably very expensive back then and well looked after or hardly worn so it's still got some mileage left. 

I think most people made their own clothes then so you could repair easily too. Why spend hours making a new shirt when it just needs a couple of stitches?"
"I have a topcoat dating from around 1900 or so. The lining is a little frayed in spots, but the material is otherwise in almost perfect condition. 

Not only were clothes expensive, but you couldn’t buy anything off the rack back then. Someone would take your measurements and make your clothes to fit you. Children usually got clothes handed down from their siblings. As a matter of fact, it wasn’t uncommon during this period for boys to wear actual frilly dresses until they got older.

The point is that clothing was not cheap, but it was made to last much longer. There were still styles that came and went (hat styles on men changed fairly often), but that was more of a luxury than a standard."
"I think part of the reason why Californians dress down more is because they value the idea of youth over authority.

People still dress up in NYC and DC because the suit shows authority and power. There may be different codes to how to wear different suits, but the suit signals power, wealth, and sophistication.

In the Bay Area and LA, communicating those traits doesn't mean anything good. You want to be seen as young and raw because these traits signal new ideas and the ability to shift paradigms. Part of it even got baked into the corporate culture in Silicon Valley; the worst dressed at major meetings would likely be the technical experts that you had to convince."
"I don't know what I was expecting, but for some reason the ""added sound"" part bummed me out."
"I counted two women. One walking in the background with a man. In the same shot, right before it cuts off, there is another woman walking across the shot with a man. That same shot saw a couple of kids together."
They were off dancing. Safely.
Also Coca-Cola had cocaine in it. Just saying.

"Food scarcity plays a part, as well as less variety of foods. Probably no one in that video had ever had an avocado, for example."
I blame sugar
"It's a combination. Many people are obese today, but not everyone. The availability/quality of food, genetics, and food costs all seem to be relevant."
Here's the dude that made it...  [https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/f8qw32/oc\_i\_have\_made\_a\_60\_fps\_4k\_version\_of\_new\_york/](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/f8qw32/oc_i_have_made_a_60_fps_4k_version_of_new_york/)
It's just a bunch of stock audio mixed together that seems appropriate.
The audio is definitely just modern recordings that are layered on top.
I like the way you think!
"Uh, a proper fitting suit is maybe the most comfortable outfit you can wear."
"You know what, that’s it. I’ve always been really fascinated with history, but clearly I don’t know shit. Your comment had inspired me to change that."
I don't think shampoo existed at this point except as a sort of DIY thing found in hair salons or herbal homemade stuff. An average dude's hair was probably just a greasy mop most of the time. I probably would have kept a hat on my head too.
Hole in the Ozone layer wasn't a thing then at least.
Nicely crisped face-skin...mmmm.
"The cramped living and working conditions of the poor and working classes also made the spread of lice worse, leading to an association between lower class and headlice.

I came across an unpleasant old lady with this belief years ago, riddled with lice, but convince that she didn't have them because headlice were something that 'only lower class people have'."
Honestly I'm not sure of the details. It's a factoid I picked up from a tour of an English heritage site. It is likely just a perceived truth that shifted to a fashion thing.
You mistake me for an expert. I am in fact a gestalt of obscure trivia in a trench coat.

The clip at 1:19 is definitely using the ambient noise from rollercoaster tycoon.
These are amazing and oddly haunting to think everybody here in these videos are dead. Young and old all have died
Wow I didn't realize bicycles were so common in the 1890s
"It’s not only possible to upscale this kind of footage, but even better it can be rescanned natively at 4K or higher! I actually do professional film scanning for a living for both new and old film with a 6.5K HDR system, the same type of machine that’s used by the Criterion Collection and the Library of Congress"
Oh shit. I'm surprised how popular bicycles already were. At 2:30 you can see some people already riding them without hands!
*Glances alarmingly at ingrown toenail*
I work in a PT office and have seen a patient who lost their leg below the knee from a bone infection that originated from a small cut on the bottom of their foot. It still happens although granted that patient was elderly
The latter of which would often be solved by lopping off the infected limb.
this is a running joke around here
"Looking at his face made me genuinely sad, knowing what the future would hold for this bright eyed youngling and the multiple ways his life could have ended in tragedy."
I’m not optimistic about our now tbh

Projected population in 2150 is about 11 billion
Multiverse theory would agree
"I’m talking about things on the video, expensive things. Clothes worn by poor people were of lower quality that’s obvious. But my point that mostly all expensive things built back in the day were meant to last. Nowadays you of course can have very well made things, but they drown in “this is expensive because reasons”. People don’t look at seams and fabric anymore, they look at trendy brand.

Most depressing thing to me is that for the price of some brands that sell $1 t-shirts with a print for thousands of dollars, you can commission custom shirt made of silk, with embroidery of your design."
And cheap abundant carbs.
"100% this, and probably TV, computer games, social media, porn, getting food delivered to your door, emasculation, or the dole."

In 100 degree weather in the middle of July? Yeah suit it’s pretty uncomfortable bro...
"I think most people just washed their hair with soap. Probably not as nice a result as shampoo, but no need for homemade herbal stuff."
That average dude with the greasy mop clearly isn't a Dapper Dan man. Hats and pomade kept that stuff under control.
"If you don't use shampoo, your head won't produce as much oil, it self regulates."
Soap existed in 1911...
I havent used shampoo or conditioner for over 3 years.  I rinse and comb my hair in the shower thats all. And my hair is never greasy.
Soap has been around for thousands of years
"Ok, that was indeed a very deep question , with my false assumption that you have a master degree in hatology. Still thanks for sharing that fact, I'm sure it will pop up in my head during a job interview or date."

"It’s not that bad. Don’t think about the future you’ll miss, focus on the present you can enjoy"
"Oh snap, you're right."
"My grandma made all of her clothes in the 1920s. They were extremely poor. Most of her items lasted until the mid 2000s until my mom threw them away. They’d grab fabric from the truck and use it for napkins, curtains and clothes. Quality was something important until the last 20 years. Now it’s all buy more, upgrade, replace."
Natural fibres like linen and cotton are surprisingly breathable.
"I tried washing my hair with egg, cold water, and a little bit of olive oil once... actually turned out pretty well. I'm an exceptionally greasy person and it felt clean for a solid day.

If you use lukewarm water, the egg will turn into chunks in your hair though."

Holy shit this website sucks lol
T-shirts and jeans are both made from cotton - but having said that I don't think jeans are that breathable!
"If your tee and jeans are polyester, yeah actually. I can wear fewer clothes, made out of polyester/nylon/etc and be much hotter than if I was layered up in cotton clothes. And I say that as someone who lives in the deep sticky south. Clothing material matters!"
Tbf soap is a blanket term. I doubt my homeboy has a keg of lard & lye for his hair. But shampoo isn't all the different from say liquid handsoap.
"Shampoo’s main ingredient is a surfactant called SLS, that is also found in many soaps. Shampoo is basically watered down soap with some additives."

By having the entire world shown, you can finally get all the little tedious tasks done easier like finding the one piece of Corruption so you can finally purify the world."
yes
Gosh Ive wanted this for so long now. I would LOVE that.

"When I get better at coding, I think I will make a mod that has all of these suggestions."
"Also add a way to highlight things on this map, so like, corruption blocks or chests could be shown extra clearly."
"This should be a master mode only drop, a bit op"
"Finally, something that might justify playing Master mode."
Bro stop asking relogic bc they wont add anything but ask modders instead
"When I get better at coding, I think I will make a mod that has all of these suggestions."
No need for that in my main world

"Devs: 1.4 is the last update for Terraria. 

People on reddit: Add this, petition for that.

You're waiting for the Manual (GitHub) verison of 1.4 TmodLoader like me right? Cant bring myself to the 32bit steam version. Dosen't help that its a seperate .exe and it dosent count hours towards Terraria iirc

"Are you talking about stuff like the DPS Meter, and Stopwatch? You can activate and de-activate the visibility of the information it tells you. If you open your inventory with Escape, you can see under the minimap in the top right a whole bunch of icons representing each of the informational accessories you have. If you click on them, they no longer show. This doesn't exactly help unless you have the Cell Phone, because those accessories still take up space in your inventory, but it's not too hard to make, given you already obtained the Travelling Merchant drops."
I would just make it an expert drop that you can use in any world
"I would make it a guaranteed drop, but only on the first defeat of Moon Lord in a world."
A small price to pay for salvation.
There is already an item in either Luiafk or Alchemist mod(can't recall) that does exactly same thing that OP described - reveals whole map on use.

"I'm super looking forwards to the Fargo's Mods because dear god were they so much fun. They had an item you could craft in Hardmode requiring a bunch of Lenses, Black Lenses, Suspicious Looking Eyes, Mechanical Eyes, and Souls of Sight that let you do exactly what this post says. It wasn't even that bad to farm because if you use a Solidifier on a banner, you can get the rare drop from that mob! That was one feature I really hoped would've made it into regular 1.4...."
and AFAIK it disables achievements.
I think they're working on a 64 bit version. Also correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure I saw the 1.4 tmodloader on github a while ago.
"And I'm here waiting to be able to play on fullscreen ultrawide again on Linux, it's all stretchy and the mouse is kinda locked to a part of the screen ever since 1.4 came out"
"Those are alright. What I meant were things like the presserator and paint sprayer. Useful but very situational for builders. They would be a bit more comfortable to use if you could just use them once, and then have them as a toggle in the inventory. I think the presserator is already a toggle, but that only shows up when you have it equipped."
Just replace the gravity globe.

Either way I’d love to be able to get achievements while using magic storage.  That mod is pretty much essential to me."
"Oh, so it's that new? I just recently played for the first time since shortly after 1.2 came out and was annoyed that it was unplayable in fullscreen."

"Definitely is in fargos, but it's a pretty simple concept that's probably in several mods if I were to guess."

Well done guys! Congratulations are well deserved. And what better way to celebrate than with your favourite game of rugby. Kiwis rock!
This is fantastic to see. Really pleased for all New Zealanders and congratulations to Jacinda Ardern's govt. On top of that it was a great game yesterday!

"I've never been a fan of rugby. I'm English, and spent a couple of years living in Auckland. We went to Eden Park to see All Blacks v Ireland and it was one of my favourite memories of being there. I had no idea what was happening most of the match but seeing the haka performed right there in front of me was incredible, it still makes my hair stand on end when I think of it."

Saying New Zealand did well at COVID response... fair enough.

Comparing the response of New Zealand to the U.S. is not comparing “apples to apples”... to be honest it’s kind of ignorant and totally irrelevant."

"You are so brave for saying this. This absolutely hasn’t been the top comment of every single New Zealand post in the last week.

"Haha yes U.S. bad, hell yeah"
We're far too self-absorbed and undisciplined to accomplish anything like that in the US.
It much easier for country like New Zealand which is geographically isolated. Much more impressive is state in countries of eastern Europe who fought well against covid
"We needed a concise and clear plan from the federal government like all national crisis are supposed to play out.  In NJ beaches are open but the out of state tags I saw this weekend are insane.

If we didn’t have open borders between all states I can see how this would be managed but everything I’m seeing locally and being one of the harder hit states, we are about to get absolutely slaughtered by round 2 as services that require close contact with people start to open back up."
"Yes, we also have a low amount of cases here in Greece too.."
Blame Trump. It’s a total failure of leadership.
People here still believe its a hoax and have no 2nd thought on spreading it. Americans are self centered entitled cunts.
"Lolol how did I freaking know, this first comment would be a jab at the U.S."
"Must be nice to live in a country where the government cares (or pretends to care) about you and doesn't treat you like cattle. A good number of Americans will be sacrificed for the economy, some that recover will probably be left with crushing medical debt."

This just shows how proper planning by the Government could have done wonders
We could have done better but globally Australians can’t complain I reckon.
Difference is states in Australia have the power to enforce their own rules.
"Come on. Australia has done bloody well, everyone did their part, and the experts largely made the right calls and were listened to."
"Hey, we aren't that far behind them with 4 times the population. Australia will be there by the end of June."
"Not sure what you think you have to complain about here in Australia. I’ve family in Canada and the utter dumpster fire that is the US atm, and have been quite happy with the response here in Australia. We were a beat behind New Zealand and have about that same result."
On the other hand I'm glad corona has stopped me from going to the last few broncos games
"Shit on scummo for the things he does that are shit (which is a lot) but credit where credit is due. Australia has done well, a lot better than most countries."
"Samesies, rules are being relaxed and all but new cases are popping up and everytime I go outside I get stupid paranoid so the solution is to not go out eh"
We're going pretty good to be honest. Only potential spanner is the thousands that decided now was the best time to gather in large crowds without distancing or protective gear.
"I found it, and i wish I could pin this to the top so that more people could be educated about our covid response"
"Every Billionaire has bought a panic home in NZ for the last several decades because whatever contagion, calamity, social disorder will leave NZ alone due to its remoteness, smallness and ""islandness"". 

Since China's numbers are nowhere near reliable, let us leave her out of the rankings. 

India was always going to be #1 in any pandemic list due to the size of the population alone, not to mention poverty, lack of room for social distancing, comparatively open reporting and culture of large shared dwellings. It is a miracle that India isn't yet #1, and I'd think anyone who can see that will admit that is very praiseworthy."
"They did say if your unwell don’t go to work or school or a sports game, but our economy is now ready to start repairing and with time it will heal"

"They haven't had a case for 23 days, and the last case of community spread was over 40 days ago. Moreover, as far as I know their airport is closed or they have a mandatory 14 day quarantine"
"This, how can they assume it will not return?

It will!"
"With 50% of those effected being non-symptomatic, this might be larger then expected.  

Hopefully they couldn't get tickets."
"Great. It’s winter down here, so I need to keep my hands warm."
"And risk getting infected? Seems like letting you/anyone in would be exactly the thing they dont want to do, since things appear under control over there.

Also, its my understanding that they have some laws that seem odd as an outsider (no growing your own foods).

But clearly they got some stuff very right."
"I mean, can you handle the fact that pies are more of a savoury food than a dessert here? 

Apparently that’s a big issue for Americans. 

P.S. this is meant lightheartedly :)"
"For sure, we are just one big bubble now"
"A country is as isolated as it wants to be. Had the USA followed what NZ did we too could be having sports games. NZs trajectory was the same as every country. They just didnt storm courthouses with guns bc of ""muh rights"". Then comepletly shut down intl airtravel. Unlike the USA who banned china flights hours after our top 3 airlines already decided to do so but yet left europe wide open. They did everything right and I'd immagine it wasnt easy for its citizens, But they did it for the good of their country and are now reaping the benefits. Good on you NZ."
"That and following through with a sensible plan.

This wasn't just luck.  It was also cooperation and participation."
I hate how this keeps getting posted as if trying to discredit New Zealand’s achievements. Pop numbers be damned they managed this because they took it seriously from day one and didn’t drag their feet like the rest of the world.
"Yeah, I’m not a butthurt America. I’m an extremely jealous one. Live in USA and now I have a mom who left home ONCE between March and end of May to go to a mandatory doctors appointment. She’s been hospitalized for weeks with covid (think she’s recovering - hard to tell since hospitals don’t allow us any access).

"Bro you can just fly over once they let non-citizens/permanent residents back in. No visa needed and IIRC after a year you get permanent residency and the right to vote. Pay is shit compared to Auz and rent is expensive so make sure you don't have rose-tinted glasses.

If you are young you should buy a van and just do the vinyard/fruit picking travel the country mish that all the euros do. After a summer+ of that you would know if NZ is right for you.

"Our borders are closed. Testing continues but we haven’t had a new case in 23 days. 40+ days since last community transmission. Mandatory two week quarantine for anyone who now enters the country. 
We also mostly trust our government to not feed us constant horseshit, unlike a few others I don’t need to name..."
Borders are closed for the most part and anyone entering the country has to quarantine for two weeks
"Only citizens and permanent residents are allowed in. Exceptions are being made for small groups of high economic value (America's cup teams, Avatar film crew) and I believe we will soon be accepting immediate (non-citizen/resident) family of citizen/residents as well.

EDIT: Apparently it's residents, not just permanent residents!"
"So what about the UK, Spain, Italy, France, and Sweden, with more deaths per capita from COVID-19 than the United States. Who do you blame there?"
"Most recent case was 23 days ago. Traced from a particular cluster. Our last known case recovered...... about a week ago. We test thousands everyday. 

There is more than a 95% chance we have kicked it. 

Those are current numbers."
"There is no need to test everybody. They were doing thousands of tests per day and anybody who wanted could get tested, even with no symptoms. They were doing random testing at the supermarket, and I believe testing wastewater for traces of covid. They found nothing so are confident that there are no cases left. If something does come up, they will contact trace and isolate."
"As someone mentioned a few posts above, NZ had only 2-3 new cases for 14 days BEFORE 23 days without any new case. If there were asymptomatic carriers, they would have „ousted“ themselves in any of these time periods.

Is it impossible that there are asymptomatic carriers? NO. Is it veeeery very unlikely? Yes. 

At that point it is safe to assume NZ is Covid-free."
"If we had carriers who don’t show symptoms you’d think we’d also be getting sick people who do have symptoms...

We’re still testing everyone with cold/flu symptoms. We’re all healthier than normal this year though due to lockdown."
You realise the chance of those 80% only passing around it each other and no one presenting with Covid in 23 days is highly unlikely?
Who?
"23 days with no cases and a good 14 before that with only 2-3 cases.
Some of the highest testing per capita in the world.
Borders closed and 14 day quarantine for any New Zealanders returning home.
They've taken all the precautions they can. Trying to get the economy running again now."
"It was linked to a large cluster, a rest home to be exact. Unfortunately that’s where most of our deaths came from, but everyone that was part of that cluster was heavily monitored. Yes there is still a chance of there being a case, but I see it as unlikely"
"Seriously, I dont get it. How are you supposed to do the same thing for 335 million people as you are for a small island? They are two monumentally different situations

"Same here, rugby is our only motivation"
Hey that's me!
It feels like it’s going to be a long time before it isn’t weird.
I hope we're back to normal soon but I have a bad feeling that we are probably not even a quarter of the way to being totally done with the pandemic.
"Being in LA feels like you're about to crash, like, all the time. Whether you're walking or driving or working, everything just feels like there's a bit of chaos and impending doom."

Kinda like Ned Flanders singing."
"See also: Taiwan.

Taiwan is an island country which neighbors China, with deep business ties that involve ~1.3 million citizens living in and commuting to/from the PRC extensively before the pandemic. 

With a population of 23.5 million, Taiwan has (as of 14 June) only 443 accumulated cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 80% (352/443) of which were imported (and isolated immediately). Another 8% (36/443) were confirmed aboard a Navy ship, and the remaining 12% (55/443) locally acquired cases have not caused any outbreaks. 430 of 443 patients have recovered successfully under treatment: 7 patients have died, and 6 patients are currently being treated in negative pressure isolation rooms.

Taiwan has managed to entirely PREVENT an outbreak, without even resorting to lockdown measures, save for a cautionary two-week school closure in mid-February. I wouldn't attribute to this success just to the fact that Taiwan is an island, though. We the Taiwanese and fellow expats/visitors trust the transparent government and society in which science -- especially medical -- is revered, and people actively look out for each others' health, wearing masks and distancing appropriately. Not to mention a duty we recognize to report ourselves if we suspect we're showing COVID-19 symptoms; this is how the 55 domestic cases were located and isolated.

Oh, and Taiwan acted with more urgency and scientific integrity than did the WHO, of which we are not even a member state. This means that Taiwan does not receive timely information about this pandemic, or any other global health concern."
"I’m in UK if only we were a small island 


Oh wait"
"Cool, cool. Explain Vietnam then: no deaths, and just a sputtering of 0-2 new cases each day. It borders China, and has over ten times the population density of New Zealand."
"Apparently it’s not as easy as you would think. Puerto Rico half assed everything regarding COVID and we’re probably going to be looking at an increase in cases in the following weeks (which, we’ll only really know if they even count/report them properly)."
"People love to use this argument as some sort of way to justify other countries failing to act against COVID. 

NZ is 3 islands and roughly the size of Japan. Given the economic reliance on tourism and the highest number of kiwis returning home in history, there was actually a significant risk for COVID to spread like wildfire through NZ. Strict lockdown restrictions, high community compliance and early closure of borders is what helped.

(And for the record, being Australian doesn’t mean shit. Source: a kiwi who worked on the COVID response)."
"Me too. I’m enjoying the relaxation of our rules. I’d be a lot more comfortable if we were in the same position as NZ regarding being COVID free. 

I really hope we don’t blow this."
It’s also easier when you have a population that understands that gathering on large crowds during a pandemic isn’t acceptable for any reason.
Tell that to Boris
"no, it's easier when you have someone in charge that actually would make a decision.


leaving it up to the states was the wrong answer"
Thailand's done it. I think we're at 18 days since the last new case.
Taiwan or South Korea are democratic countries in close proximity to China and have handled the virus well with lesser restrictions than European countries or US. To me the main difference is that these countries have taken the problem very seriously since the beginning.
"What’s funny is I think Vietnam’s response was partly successful because the govt is authoritarian; plus a super civil society and one of the most patriotic in the world. People don’t need any convincing to pull together for the country.

I agree it wouldn’t be surprising for Vietnam to fluff the numbers. Political transparency is not really a question here. But the government shared data with the people as never before and it really does seem to have been an effective containment so far.

Right now things are back to normal in VN. Around ten thousand Vietnamese nationals wish to be repatriated from around the world."
"Imagine unironically saying America is under “authoritarian rule” and grouping it with China. You do know that you can vote the orange man out of office this year right? If the USA was truly under “authoritarian rule”, we’d have a whopping of 0 reported coronavirus cases, because that’s what donald trump would push with a government controlled media."
"> Vietnam is under authoritarian rule, like China **and the USA**

LOLOLOLOLOLOL how the fuck do people like you actually exist"
"But this is reddit, its not about informed, but rather emotional responses that prosper here. Extra brownie points if negative towards USA or Trump ofc."

Hitting reddit buzzwords to try and get internet points is fucking pathetic lol.
"How so?

I’m a kiwi and don’t think we do actually share most of the problems the average western country does. We’re by all measurements one of the best countries in the world, and the fact we’ve got Norona shows yet again how good we are.

Having said that, don’t move here. We’re good, honestly.

Edit: please properly read my comment and the other replies before saying the exact same thing as several others haha."
Yep she did it perfect and showed the world how elite she is in handling major problems
Agree with you on that.
Yeah nah
"I absolutely detest Scott Morrison (at least as much as I can detest a world leader on the other side of the planet). But I agree this seems like a disingenuous attack. Australia and New Zealand both have 4 deaths per million at the moment, and New Zealand actually has more cases per million than Australia with fewer tests per million as well.

Of course there are still new cases in Australia while there are none in New Zealand, so they didn't handle it quite as well, but they definitely didn't drop the ball on this like much of the rest of the world did."
"We're doing so well due to the state premiers, not due to scummo. Scummo said 'we should do it this way' and the states - mostly Vic and NSW said no and went their own way. Can't speak too much for NSW, but I'm down here in Vic and Dan Andrews did a hell of a job in my opinion. Way more than the PM. He made the hard calls, got ridicule for it especially on schools, and in the end he was right as some teachers tested positive. Could have been a huge deal and the federal government was calling him out for being 'too cautious'. That guy has my vote for as long as he wants to run for premier. Just wish he had ambitions for PM."
We still have hot spots of infection. Yeah we are doing better then most of the world. But we are still a few months behind NZ of being covid19 free
"Yeah we’re definitely doing better than most other countries, but let’s not forget in early March Scomo was still downplaying the threat  and planning on going to the footy. We could have caught this earlier, and especially given our low population density, if we’d had some more competent leadership we could also be where NZ is right now."
He didn't do shit. The state premiers straight up acted against him to bring in restrictions and closures. He wanted everything to stay open much longer.
"Well if they really are interested, they would have scanned the entire comment section.
Congrats on finding mine tho"
"NZ is basically the highest, most volcanic explodey bits of an underwater continent. I reckon I’m safer here in Australia."

"Handled it well initially by early lockdown, strict checking at airports etc. But after 2-3 months of lockdown, he removed the lockdown when the cases were at it's peak. I don't know the thought process behind that either. India will be number 1 quite soon."
Tbh it's bad. very bad but our Prime Minister is a good orator. He does not make things look bad. He has bought out almost everyone so all the wrong doings is hidden and all media keeps talking about is Pakistan. (Fun Fact: China has captured 60km of India's territory in last few days) He almost never gives a interview. It's all in the hands of State governments now.
"I wouldn’t trust that approval rating, considering I don’t think any Muslims are happy with him."
"> airport is closed or they have a mandatory 14 day quarantine

Bit of both - airport is closed to non-citizens and non-permanent residents and there's a 14-day quarantine for everyone coming in."
I’m in China and Beijing just discovered a cluster of new cases (50 total with 46 asymptomatic) This is after 50 days of no cases.
"Yes, but it's not exactly like we've tested the entire population, ""No known active cases"" is accurate, ""No cases"" is what we hope for"
"Are they enforcing the 14 day quarantine? In Canada we have the same rules but people are ignoring it. On Vancouver Island we haven't had a case in 38 days and while measures are greatly relaxed compared to the rest of the country we're still maintaining social distancing.

South Korea showed us that if there is one NZ resident returning home that breaks quarantine to see the match they could be back up to thousands of cases in a week."
Unless they tested everyone and made sure to isolate all those who tested negative (so that people can't catch it afterwards) there's always a chance.
"It may, but do you actually want to keep an entire country in lockdown with literally zero cases active for 23 days?"
"There's an outside chance that there are undiagnosed asymptomatic pockets, but 40 days is a long time. And there is also a chance that monkeys night fly out of my butt."
Or maybe he could build a big wall! That’d work real good...
"Typically flexing is considered a dick move, but in this case it's showcasing the results of quick-acting procedures"
"I'd be totally willing to quarantine and comply with any screenings required, the last thing I would want to do is spread covid there. Realistically it would take me a year or two to be ready to leave, so hopefully this situation is under control by then.

But honestly from what I've seen their society seems closer to my personal values than America does. I have serious misgivings about the direction we're going."
We do have both.
"Australian here, hopefully our bubbles can connect soon so we can get back to losing at rugby."
This. We actually let our health spokesperson lead the discussion. Dr. Bloomfield is now our national hero.
If that's the case then I hope it goes well for you guys! Hopefully Australia won't be far behind you.
"Your username is 4 digits/letters off mine, also nice username"
Very much so.
"At the beginning of the lockdown, our prime minister was asked ""you want to eradicate COVID-19 from New Zealand so you can start the economy up again, correct?
And she replied saying ""fuck no. I just want to go to a rugby match as safely and as soon as possible.""

Source: my imagination."
"No, your from NZ, your leaders are great."
if there was a free effective vaccine released worldwide tomorrow i think it would take about a week for people to forget about social distancing
Hmm...why?

"Taiwan also has arguably the best medical system in the world.

But you know what I have been scratching my head about - how Taiwan and Japan are both countries that don't have hand washing culture, but they were able to contain the virus."
"Taiwan also had universal masking.

Meanwhile over here in the Western world we are still debating whether they are in fact harmful or not because some epidemiologists think that giving ~~non-phd-holding peasants~~ regular people masks to wear will cause them to suddenly develop an extreme predilection towards licking every doorknob they come across and that it is impossible to train a human being on how to properly wear a mask without 7 years of medical school."

Please compare international travel and population size. Even Manchester in the north of England gets a lot more international travel than New Zealand let alone London.
"Population of NZ: 4.89 million
Population of UK: 66.65 Milion

Population density is one of the more important factors"
Vietnam had a very strict lock down until the end of April.  The cops would even break up family dinners if people were seen sitting within 6ft of each other
"why do people always bring this up? There are some countries which have it significantly harder than NZ and its OKAY to say it. Is it an excuse? Kinda yea  I guess? But its a valid point.

Germany borders so many countries and is in the middle of Europe.

There are so many million people more transiting NZ each single day. Could other countries do much better than they do now?Yes. But we have to acknowledge that NZ has it much easier than other countries.

People see  numbers without context but its the most important thing. Countries like Vietnam can do those extreme measures. If Germany applied the exact same  restrictions our economy would have gone to trash and the recovery would cost  years.

We can have all the talk about worth of human life but in the end you cant risk an economic downfall to save every single one."
"> Cool, cool. Explain Vietnam then

What's with the attitude, he merely said that it's a lot easier, which is an obvious fact. It's not like he claimed that it's impossible elsewhere."
There are no deaths if they're not reported...
"Westerners wouldn't accept lockdowns Vietnam or China style. If you even suggest that BLM protests aren't a good idea because of the virus you'd be branded a hate-filled Nazi.

The difference in outcomes is generally to do with culture. Countries with extremely oppressive states and far reaching government powers have done well, because it's not a choice to listen to them or not. It works well 99% of the time because people want personal freedoms and don't want to live in an oppressive state. However, the one time it is effective is during a pandemic.

You really think you'd be able to take over part of a city and turn it in to a autonomous zone in Vietnam or China?"
"Is Vietnam testing all the rural farmers and inner city poor people that live shoulder to shoulder in absolute squalor? I believe that New Zealand has no cases, but Vietnam? No."
Last time I checked a lot of Americans died there to. O you mean covid.
"I mean look, some states did better because they were harsher on lockdown procedures. We can br like those countries if you want but we will give up certain freedoms. You dont clamp down on people like that so readily and peacefully unless it's in the culture. 

I've thought a lot about this. Our response was terrible. Do I wish masks and the like were ready from the get go yes. Do I wish we just locked everyone in their homes and tracked everyones phone locations like many Asian countries did? Hello no. Our government is not worthy to wield that kind of power. 

We will have to make this choice again, and it's likely going to be a disaster again, so prepare now."

They put lockdown in place VERY early.  I have a mate who lives there permanently.  He teaches English as a native speaker. Has had almost zero income since March and no access to government assistance.
You act like governments are all seeing or something. Nobody KNOWS Forsure if theres no cases in NZ just as no one knows if vietnam has 0-2 cases daily. More than half of transmitters are asymptotic
"Puerto Rico couldn’t make their own test

Thanks for whatever role you played.
We heard about that referendum you have coming up soon.  Pretty sure you are gonna get lots of tourism from Australia soon.
"Yes and it also helps that it was a somewhat isolated country. In ireland we have a similar population but were hit fairly badly. But the difference is that on average NZ has around 2m people landing in the airports annually while ireland has around 11m people landing annually, also ireland doesnt have control of its border with the UK. NZ geography was an important part of how they were able to contain the virus early."

"Thailand is not trustworthy on their reporting. For example they claimed for months that Phuket had 0 cases.

* Mental health (One of the highest rates of suicide in the OECD IIRC)

We also have a lower rate of infection per capita though so we are currently behind them in terms of infections when adjusted for total population size. If we can manage our last cases (as we seem to be doing with longer and longer periods of no community transmission) and the protests don’t result in major outbreaks we’ll likely be case free in a better or at least very comparable position to New Zealand.

"The odds that there's only been asymptomatic cases or very mild cases for like a month straight with nobody getting seriously sick is really, really low."

"The wearing of a face mask is a factor. People in these countries already wear face masks when they are sick even before the pandemic started so making face masks mandatory was met without issues. Taiwan even increased face mask production to make sure each citizen has something to wear. 

Also, Taiwan has a past with pandemic due to a previous outbreak of SARS in the 2000s so the government already has a plan in place in case it happened again. Their current leaders are also involved in the field of science which meant that they knew what they were doing."

TIL NZ is almost twice the size of UK.
"You close down international travel, it doesn't matter how many airports you have or how big they are, they're shut."
"> Even Manchester in the north of England gets a lot more international travel than New Zealand let alone London.

to be fair, NZ gets about 4 million international visitors a year, versus Manchester's 1.4 million. 

We only have a few international airports so most of those arrivals are concentrated in two or three big cities.

If we are gonna go there, we had more international arrivals from one country alone (1.5 million from Oz) than Manchester did...."
"Yes but the point is that New Zealand banned international travel, the UK didn't."
"Such rubbish.

UK is now implementing 2 week mandatory quarantine for all flight arrivals which is a policy they stole from Australia/NZ. Why didn't they have this in place months ago ?  

Why did the UK advocate for ""herd immunity"" for months at the start instead of putting in place testing and restrictive policies ? 

Oh that's right it's because you have that nutjob Cummings running the show who hates listening to experts."
"Also flights in and out of the county. 

During the time covid-19 was spreading undetected and unreported (Thank you, WHO!), the UK and US had tens of millions of Chinese nationals from Wuhan filtering in and out unregulated. New Zealand has basically zero international business."

There is no virus in Ba Sing Se...
"I understand that the Vietnamese number is so unreal and suspicious. But the report here may be the most precise in the world. Every countries only reports the number of cases and death on daily basis. But Vietnam published every details of every patients on national TV and all other kind of media right after it's confirmed (age, job, travel location history, symptoms, the neighborhood, every people having direct contact with the patient).
If someone tried to avoid the quarantine or wear a mask, they're considered to be an enemy of the country. And they have to deal with flood of harassment on social media."
"Asia has also seen SARS, avian and swine flu outbreaks in recent memory"
Sounds like a good way to get mushed by a tank
"The first outbreak was in an rural area and quickly contained. It was in the home province of my father and people were tested. 

Thing is, the East Asia countries minus Japan acted very rapidly, because this isn't the first time. You can trust that they took it very seriously."
"If they live in such a rural place, the chance of them getting the virus also gets lower."
"It would be clear if it was an unreported pandemic from the hospitals being flooded with patients presenting Covid-19 symptoms, like in Brazil or Russia. Instead there hasn't been anything like that at all.

SARS was a shock to Vietnam. They were woefully unprepared and had no real plan beyond quarantining the infected hospital and letting the infected die out. It was bucket of ice water dumped over the leadership, and they put a lot of effort into establishing and maintaining an extremely effective pandemic response for future outbreaks. They've been training for 17 years for this outbreak, and it paid off."

For reference, we have gone 23 days without any new cases, and >40 since the last confirmed community transmitted case.

"That's a butchering of statistics, and not really a good argument at all. 78% of New Zealand is uninhabited land, and the *vast* majority of people live clustered in towns or cities.

The city of Auckland for example has a population of 1.6 million, which is almost a third of the entire country. It's a medium sized city with [an urban population density of about 2542 people per km2.](http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf) By way of comparison, Vancouver has an urban population density of 2479 people per km2, and the San Fransisco Bay Area is at 2051 people per km2. If population density is the main factor, then surely all those cities that are less dense than Auckland would be fine, right?

Also, if you want to talk population density, you can't ignore the elephant in the room. Taiwan has a population of 23.7 million people on a tiny island in the middle of the Asia-Pacific, right next to China. All 5 major cities in Taiwan - Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung - have between 11,258 and 21,468 people per km2. [And yet somehow Taiwan has effectively eradicated Covid-19.](https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202006100011) There hasn't been a single domestically transmitted case in over *60* days. The country never even needed to go into lockdown at all. 

The difference. Is. Government. The UK is a rich country, has/had a good healthcare system, is an island, and had *months* to prepare while Covid-19 was still only ravaging China. *The CCP put 1/8th of the entire planet's population under lockdown in January, and so many Western countries just shrugged their shoulders and ignored it.* You can't blame geography or population density or tyrannical governments when even remote Amazonian tribes are dying from Covid-19. So many Western governments absolutely failed to do basics like stockpiling PPE for healthcare workers, or properly check international arrivals for flu-like symptoms. I'm not even going to get into the whole mess with 5G conspiracy theorists and hoaxers."

Constitution is a bitch at one time it gives right to protest for BLM but at the same time it also give you right to protest for getting a haircut in the middle of pandemic.
"Thanks pesky Constitution, the US can't use the police or National Guard to force people to stay at home, disperse crowds or haircut protesters, in the middle of a pandemic. Oh wait!"
"Yeah that's generally true but in New Zealand taking control is locking down during a pandemic, getting the numbers down and then kicking goals in the name of freedom or whatever. 

Though I've never heard a New Zealander harp on about freedom, tbh.

Controlling a health crisis is not the gateway to dictatorship. Arresting and shooting journalists is. Refusing to disclose the recipients of billions of dollars of loans is. Inciting violence is. Suppressing votes is. Trump did all those things and yet your Neanderthal brain is focused on where Fox News wants it focused. You not being able to get your little haircut for a few months has put the US in a very dangerous place that it didn’t need to be in.

"New Zealand didn't take such extreme measures though. They took firm measures, but nowhere near what Vietnam (or even North Korea) did.

Their success came from early and clear intervention combined with the fact they were able to stop any new cases from coming in. 

There's plenty of countries where success like New Zealand would not be possible without interventions that most of the population would not think worthwhile."

It's not really surprising that people who fundamentally disagree with having functioning government can't run a country when they've never even tried before."
We have them because our country is full of stupid pricks who would rather vote in a heartless racist sexist prick then someone who actually cares. This is not his fault.
Why would acknowledging the Constitution make someone an ignorant asshat?
So in your opinion the police here in the USA should be peering through windows and breaking into houses to physically separate family members who aren’t sitting 6 feet apart?
"If being an ignorant asshat means that you dislike the police breaking up family dinners because of covid19, then I'm an ignorant asshat."
I would literally rather die than have the police be able to break up family dinners. If that makes me an ignorant asshat then my anus is a necklace i guess.
Our constitutional rights are uniquely enforced and not many countries abide by their constitution the way America does.
Don‘t worry. The US will just choose to ignore the ugly parts and thus just teaching about the good things the „mostly friendly“ protests has brought to the US.
I’d say the one where they burned over 300 buildings
"They will say “the protests that had violence and resulted in the deaths of citizens and police officers, and the creation of an autonomous zone after taking over a police precinct”.

And they wouldn’t be talking about the protests about not being able to get a haircut."
"OK, I just change ""the president"" to ""the US"" then. We are comparing a country to another country right?

I'm not sure what the president of the US could do, but saying the virus will be gone by April ""like a miracle, it will disappear” didn't help."
"Maybe he shouldn’t have called it a hoax about a
Billion times.  Or lie about not knowing when he was debriefed about a million times.  Or shut down borders to Europe when their cases were spiking.  Or listen to pretty much every health expert and encourage his party’s state leaders to open up and follow the phases you know instead of telling people to “liberate” states and promote violence.  
  
You morons who down play trumps administration bumbling of the corona response is laughable. 
   
State governors had zero intelligence on the virus while the federal government was flat out ignoring and not sharing knowledge.  They are 100% responsible for this travesty.  You my friend are a pos."
Yep. Vietnam learned many painful lessons in the 2003 SARS epidemic. Keeping a close eye on what the Chinese government is doing - and what news they're trying to suppress - is one of the main reasons why both Vietnam and Taiwan reacted so early and successfully.

We live in fucking ILLINOIS for fucks sake. These aren't even racist hillbilly family members, these are the most normal ass dudes, nice ass dudes, just so fucking lost in the right winger sauce their whole life. They even showed me (the libtard) some spicy conservative memes as ""gotchas"" that they read off like a peer reviewed research article to prove their point, it blew my mind."
"Not entirely the same, afaik, but it's less clear-cut with a lot of the statues in the UK that are controversial: lots were racists, but also did good things for their communities/countries. There's a statue of Winston Churchill that's under question - complete opposite of Hiter, in theory (since he led the opposing side, right?), but also held some racist views and isn't considered a hero in India, for example.

I don't know what all of the Confederates with statues did, but I don't think the issue is quite as obvious as it might seem."
Germany has the Generalfeldmarschall-Rommel-Kaserne. And in pretty much every city there is a memorial for fallen WW1 and WW2 soldiers. There is the Karl-Marx-Statue in Chemnitz. So yeah... the point isn't really that sound.
"Most of the confederate generals that get honored are local heroes in the small rural towns their statues exist in. The reason you’ll never see a confederate statue in the north (or especially in DC), is because nobody up here actually believes the union lost, and nobody knows who any of these irrelevant generals are. 

Most of the time, when there’s a petition to remove said statue, the person starting the petition learns about them from said plaque. Not from the history books, not from war stories, etc.. these guys are just that minuscule and unimportant. Which is also why their family erected their statues in the first place. 

For us level headed folk with perspective, the war against the confederacy was a war against slavery and perpetual racism. For the people erecting these statues , the war against the confederacy was a war against the south, and these statues stand to remind them that they still have some kind of identity, even in defeat.

You’ll never see a Hitler statue because he’s an outright evil that we know all too well, but there is a stone in Austria that commemorates Adolf Hitler’s birthplace, because it’s an essential part of history. Even Mussolini’s birthplace is a tourist attraction, and he was publicly shamed after his execution."

"actually, there's a bit of a controversy in germany because military barracks usually get named after important generals, but we dont have a lot of generals pre-1945 that arent entangled into some really f\*cked up stuff"
Let's raise a statue for our favorite kamikaze pilot in the Honolulu Airport!
Only in America
"What about Andrew Yale, although not alive for the confederacy, he was a really big slave trader?"
Confederate soldiers were white and black and are recognized as veterans in the US.
my mom unironically thinks they shouldve kept the stuff because as a kid a holocaus survivor neighbor said she visits berkenau.
It's funny how the people that mock participation trophies are the same people upset about their second place in a war statues being removed
Civil War != WW2
"We have lots of sports teams named after Native American tribes, though, and they got their asses wrecked af. And then we named one the fuckin Redskins just to be assholes about it. 'Muruca, bitch."
There ARE Hitler statues in parks and nazi carved murals above doors to buildings. There are also many many nazi buildings and art installations all over germany. I spent months traveling around germany and austria. Nazi history is everywhere and yes there are still neo nazi groups operating. When i was there a neo nazi protest erupted into violence in berlin.
"It's not about ""losers not getting stuff named after them"". It's about what's right or wrong. Even if the confederates won, that doesn't justify having the slave traders statues up and celebrated."

Trump tower??
Except for the people who get diseases named after them.
I prefer confederacy’s that didn’t get captured
Yeah seems crazy that they reinstated all the states into the Republic after the war where the elected leaders would have the same authority basically as the leaders of the north and ultimately build these memorials and continue business as usual as much as they could.  Maybe there is a historian on here who knows why we didnt treat the confederate states as territories like we do puerto rico now until some point when they could be made states later?
Guess we should take down all the Vietnam memorials?
Twitter really wants to downplay the holocaust huh
They do have a statue of Marx up though...
People need to know the good and the bad that went on through history. Looking at a statue of a black slave trading bastard will tell and remind everyone he was a bastard.
"The Nazi party was outlawed unlike the Democratic Party.

All you fake woke idiots seem to think the CSA was Republican. The Democrats used taxpayer funds to erect monuments to their traitor loser ancestors who lost a war over slavery and then created the KKK. 

But hey, if you are black you have to vote for the party that seceded from the US over their supposed God-given right to own slaves, at least according to Creepy Uncle Joe."
"Yep, and in my country, Spain, last year the government removed Fascist Dictator Franco from it's grave that was built in a huge ass monument cathedral thing that was built by slaves captured during the war and the dictatorship, and was relocated to a PUBLIC GRAVEYARD where people can still worship him and it even was celebrated as a second funeral, his family and a FUCKING FUNDATION WITH ITS NAME were there waving the dictatorship flag and he was re buried as a fucking king."
This would be a great point if Germany still didn't have Nazi reichsadler up.  Despite the Nazis the Reichsadler is still the national emblem of Germany and is still regarded as a German national symbol.
These are 2 completely different people with different mindsets and this comparison is really stupid

It’s both. That’s the whole point.

"Fairly sure there are no statues of even ""good' Nazis in Germany. For example there no statues of Erwin Rommel in public inside Germany."
You sure? Cuz I don't see us renaming the founding father's stuff.
"this comment perfectly sums up the issue

"~~True, but history is written by the victors, so the winners are ‘good’~~"
"More than that it's about good and bad ideas.

I get that the whole ""confederates were losers"" thing is mostly just about trolling, but ""might makes right"" (i.e. we won, you lost) isn't a good idea or a good system for morality, and it isn't what should be used to make this argument. All it does is reinforce the ""rebel"" mentality that these people already have. 

And we're seeing ""might makes right"" play out in the streets, where police are using tear gas and rubber bullets on citizens and the president is threatening to send in the military. Would the protesters be ""wrong"" simply because Trump decided to have troops gun them down in the streets? Of course not. 

Beyond that, this argument tacitly makes the case that, had the Confederacy WON, their ideas would be ""right"". And that's clearly not the case. Slavery would not be morally acceptable had the Confederacy won the war, and the reason slavery is morally reprehensible has nothing to do with the fact that the Union won.

Independent of the US Civil War, slavery is morally reprehensible, and that should form the basis of arguments against the Confederacy, not who won or lost the war."
Yeah but he’s french
Austerlitz makes up for all. Badboi tekkers.
The fact that you’re comparing confederate leaders to Napoleon shows you definitely don’t know enough to debate about either.
"Yup, the loser mentality is wrong. The CSA were traitors, first and foremost. They wanted to split the union and did not want to be a part of the USA. 

Don’t use the Civil War to say “scoreboard”"
People have been fighting over land and conquering other territories since the dawn of man. Not sure why the Ex-Europeans who expanded westward were any different.
Yeah I dont understand why people use that as an argument
I always thought of it more as mocking Trumps “winning” mantra.
"I think the difference is that the confederate went out of their way to start the war. They came in as equal participants, whereas Native Americans were attacked for existing"
The Croatians are a racist bunch of Nazis. At least thats what the Serbs are telling me
"If you think any country went to war with Germany because they opposed Hitler's views you are incredibly unread in the subject and naive. Not a single country went to war with Hitler because of his policies, they went to war because he had expanded too far outside of Germany and was becoming too much of a threat."

The Confederacy lost.
"The native Americans lost and were victims of genocide. The Confederacy were unsuccessful, cowardly traitors who turned tail and ran after four years."
">The Native American Indians lost...

 that is why it is wrong to equate this to a football match. We shouldn't take down confederate statues because they lost. but because they were evil enemies of america. They didn't like that we wanted freedom(the basis of america) and instead wanted to create a slave state and keep people enslaved. rape children.murder for fun. cut them. torture them.beat them. treat them less than human. Also the people who say it was states rights. Yes, they were fighting AGAINST states rights. They didn't like that more and more states no longer tolerated slavery and wouldn't return escaped slaves back to the south. The south DEMANDED the federal government take away states rights that protect slaves. They were anti freedom and anti america. they were literally the opposite of all that americans are."
After Lyndon B. Johnson was president the parties essentially flipped. David Duke the grand wizard of the KKK actually said that he couldn’t support the Democrats policies anymore and also said that the Republican Party was more suited for the KKK. Learn history man and you won’t say stupid things
"Weren't the Confederacy also built on racism, and lost a major war?"
Two groups made up of human piles of shit. Seems like a pretty accurate comparision to me
He's good. Just trying to make an honest living of hoarding the nerfs.
I too look forward to renaming Trump tower in November.
"I know what you mean, but I think the point of the tweet is more a commentary on the reconstruction era, like why is it that the Confederacy was glorified afterward instead of demonized? We wouldn't have these issues today if the Republicans at the time were just a little more hard-line on racism and pseudo-slavery

Edit: typo

Edit 2: I am aware that our political system has had a shift since the Civil War era. I mean to say the Republican party should have done more to help the freemen and ensure that political power didn't fall right back into the hands of the rich, ex-slave owning, white supremacists who started the civil war. And yes I am aware that they were Democrats."
"So are you implying that the Nazis should have won, or that the slave owners should have won?"
Sure but you can agree that as a society we shouldn't celebrate some folks now that we've got a better perspective on what they did
Some are.
"No, but you can pretty safely label racists as bad irrelevant of anything else."
Some of them are.
"Except that's not true. The whole Lost Cause myth was written by the losers. Then after WW2, we had German generals write the history of the Eastern Front which was insanely biased and passed all blame away from them."
Are you arguing that the Nazis and the Confederates were good?
No they weren’t
"He's debunking the statemet ""losers don't get stuff named after them"" and is in no way comparing confederate leaders to Napoleon other from the fact that they are both losers."
Slavers. They were slavers. Treason can be perfectly fine if you have a good reason. Slavery is the ine and only thing thats about
Traitors isn’t right either. The patriots were traitors too.
"They were different than a lot of conquerors because they didn't just want to take the land and fight hostile enemies, they were also slaughtering people who had long ago given up resisting"
"They use that as an opportunity to speak the rhetoric of people who would actually support the confederate flag.

These people are going to bothered when you call them “ignorant,” “racist,” or “inconsiderate.”

But call them losers... now that fucks with them."
It's used to mock them.
"Assuming you're right (I don't know the minds of people from 80 years ago, and don't know enough about History to be able to tell you it), he's still considered a war hero to many, for being in charge of one of the main opponents of Hitler in one of the largest wars in the history of Humanity. For just that reason, he should probably be lauded.

On the other hand, racism.

The question - and my point in my other comment, which still stands - is whether his success in the war is worth the racist views, when deciding whether to keep the statue up. And similar things go for any statue (though, again, I don't know what everyone who ever had a statue built for them did)."
"Indeed. A huge portion of the British ruling class loved Hitler. Churchill himself was all for concentration camps in South Africa and happily starved millions of Indians to feed British citizens, commenting that they have too many children anyway. Same in America where there were many prominent Nazis."
"You're not wrong. After the war was over, the Allies decided to come up with their own ""Final Solution"" to rid Europe of the Jews, and look like heros doing it. ""Oh look, here's that fictional homeland from the Bible. It's all yours!"""
"Because of the ""Losers don't get stuff named after them"" title. He stands for communism and marxism as theories which haven't worked out in most countries they were applied to."
Bullshit. How many monuments do they have and how much stuff is named after them. They lost. And by that reasoning they shouldn’t.
"The main park in berlins center. It has sculptures given by putin. There is not just hitler but several others in the center surrounded by trees. They kept it all there because they didnt want to forget there history, dark or otherwise. Also the nazi parade grounds.

Germans pretend there not there but they are. 
They just put them inside the park surrounded by trees. On of my tours brought me there. They asked us to not take pictures because its not meant to be a memorial. Just a reminder

If your going off google i would understand your disbelief. Im telling you to actually go there. REAL life often contradicts interweb fantasy."

So we should take down both statues cuz that's what I'm hearing.
You don't know history.
"So what is your excuse for the 21 Democratic senators who voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964? What about the fact that both Hillary and Obama fought for the endorsement of the late former senator and Exalted Cyclops of the KKK Robert Byrd? 

David Duke and the KKK support the Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib because they are ""anti-semetic"".

The parties essentially flipped? No, the Democratic Party stopped being the party of slavery apologists/overt racists and created the party switch myth because, just like in 2016, the Democratic Party admits no self-responsibility and equates humility with defeat instead of learning. 

The Republican Party was literally created as the anti-slavery party. The GOP scrapped the Southern Strategy after it failed for 8 years because racist southern democrats continued to vote for racist southern democrats. Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton swept the south which didn't turn red until 1994."
"The Nazis were a totalitarian government allied with other one from overseas trying to eradicate the jews and extend their country


The confederacy was some drunk hicks who didn’t appreciate black people not belonging to them"
So.... uh.... what exactly do you gentlemen do with all those nerfs?
*pseudo
"Republicans at the time were still racist. Guess who said this quote:


 “I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races … I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races from living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be a position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.”"
Funny enough it was the democrats that were the the pro slave racists at the time of reconstruction
I’m pretty sure the Republicans you reference “at the time” we’re Democrats...
"No, absolutely not.

But the problem is with his last sentense : losers don't get things after them.

That's not a good thing, this is thinking that every single war was won by the good people which isn't true."
"no, winners aren’t always good people. Stalin won the war but did a genocide and killed tons of people"
How in the hell is that implied? Jesus Christ...
"Yes, that's exactly what they said, as we can see from the words they typed. You are very smart."
"A lot of these people were judged in their time, too. Abolition movements have existed as long as slavery has, but especially in the US and the UK; people contemporary to the Confederacy judged slave owners as morally bankrupt. Columbus was rejected in his time for his horrific abuses. It’s not like people had no idea what was wrong just because it was ye olden times."
Cultural relativism
Why are you so intolerant?
You’re right. I linked an interesting thread to the other responder if you want to read that.
No. He's saying that if they won that would have been what is considered good
"No! I was just saying that most of the times people think the good guys and the winners are the same. As I read a little bit about it just now, I realize that this is a somewhat ignorant statement, but I was saying that the Nazi’s are seen as bad because they lost. If the nazi’s still were in power then most of the population would be brainwashed and would think the Nazi’s were good.

I’ll link an interesting post on r/history about this:

"I agree, but as a non-American I have to say, from across the water, it seems like you guys have a bigger elephant in the room with the slaver label and your...uh...""founding fathers"". Kind of curious to see if that conversation actually happens"
Treason is never fine. Neither is slavery.
"Or whether the genocide of 3 million Indians, concentration camps in South Africa and more evil deeds are made up by making some speeches to motivate the actual people who defeated the Nazis."
"No, a man who supported concentration camps shouldn't have statues built of him. And like I said, he did not go to war with Hitler because of Nazi policies, they went to war because Hitler got too scary for them and the UK wanted to remain the only empire in the world."
"Churchill was massively against Nazi Germany, he opposed them and was one of the few politicians to consistently argue against appeasement"
Only certain tribes. They are not all the same.
I'm from Germany. Let's go talk with me why it's different.
"The Native Americans didn't rebel because they wanted to keep slavery. In fact, after the initial war, they never rebelled at all, did they?"
I think the only things you know about history are the things you want to know or believe.

"""Southerners being upset about the BLM/Gerge Floyd riots and protests are really just upset that their old property is destroying their new property"""
"The CSA were traitors, first and foremost. Slavery was the genesis of their movement, but being TRAITORS is why every last one of their statues should be pulled from public spaces (and placed in museums). 

What the “heritage” crowd forgets is the CSA hated the USA and wanted no part of it. So if you love the USA, and want to “respect the flag”, then you can’t love the CSA and have any affection for the stars n bars."
Drunk hicks who raped black children.burned black people.hanged black people.killed them on a whim. worked them to death. raped them. stop trying to portray them as some kind of folksy light. drunk hicks. they were pure evil. they created entire pseudosciences that tried to explain away their evil. Look at Delphine Lalaurie who killed black people and used their blood to remain young. 2.4 million people died JUST ON THE WAY to america. 2.4 million. they just took the corpses and threw them overboard.. these people were 100% evil and nothing else. Imagine your own mother or sister or daughter..raped again and again and again and then forced to work.. rape-work-sleep-rape-work-sleep..throw in some whipping in there for fun.. F\*CK you and all confederates.
"The possibilities are almost endless. Typically, we slam dunk them, stick them, flip them, and ride them."
"Boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew."
"Yeah I know, that's why I said if the Republicans were more hard-line on the issue"
"Hi, you’ll also remember that ideals of the democrat and Republican Party at that time gradually shifted so the democrats became republicans and republicans became democrats."
"No, the Democrats who were hard-line on slavery went to war to protect it. I'm talking about the Republicans who were abolitionists."
"Yeah, looks like I misunderstood you."
I think they meant loser as an insult not a literal statement. That's how I took it atleast.
Also a good point
"I'm pretty sure there's very little ""relativism"" when we're talking about stolen lands and killings, besides, thinking about cultural relativism, now we're in 2020 and we know better, and to live together without harming innocents we should build a culture of acceptance and equal rights and treatment of everyone, so we should not uphold symbols that praise the opposite"

The US was founded through treason.
"But there's a difference between ""We need to stop Germany because of their genocide"" and ""We need to stop Germany because they're building too many battleships""."
Only certain tribes lost? Which ones “won” then?
the civil war is very different from WW2
This doesn't matter for this argument.
"Before they even list how the party's ""switched"", they claim Dixiecrats left the Democratic party and became republican in typical fake news fashion (like snopes, politifact, and Factcheck and them claiming that Hillary didn't delete any emails and that Trump won an Ellis Island Award with Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali for Real Estate Development even though they don't give awards for that).

No they fucking didn't. 1 single democratic senator became a republican after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because he was disgusted with the fact that 21 of his colleagues voted against it.

Your fake news article does the exact same thing it is accusing the Zodiac Killer of doing; projecting, blaming, and saying half-""truths"".

Your article says that the GOP was more interested in monopolizing the black vote; really? Because it was the democrats who made a freed black vote count for 3/5ths that of a white vote.. It was the democrats who created the KKK as a way to intimidate and physically stop blacks from voting (Republican) through violence and murder and lynching.

Segregation and Jim Crow laws were enforced BY DEMOCRATS IN DEMOCRAT STATES. 

I already know which rhetorical nothing you are gonna pull out next so I'll say this: Dixiecrats were in no way, shape, or form ""Conservative"" because slavery was outlawed in the north completely by 1804, 20 years after the US gained its independence.

Just because there was a schism in the Democratic party doesn't mean Democrats and Republicans switched their histories or their morals. Just because the South turned Republican doesn't mean Republicans are racist."
"Wow that’s generalizing, like a racist would do"
"I didnt try to portray them as that, im just too lazy to to say more"
Oh my!
"Wow, those possibilities truly are endless"
"Yeah, he knows, that’s why he said the republicans “at the time” should have done so."
I think I misread the tone of your post then.  It came across to me opposite of that.
It seems clear from the context and the fact that they specifically cite another losing side of a military conflict that they were talking about losing the Civil War. And this isn't an uncommon argument; if you look out for it you will see it frequently.
They should be celebrated based on the context of their time. Applying 2020 morals to the past is foolish
"Leading to the richest and most powerful nation to ever exist. It's relevant and not one dimensional.  Without building America on the backs of slaves the Germans would have won ww2.

Two very different things.
"Nah mate. Treason is the betrayal of your country and her interests.

"Yeah, we can keep them in our history books and leave the statues for values that better suit our today"
"> Without [...] America [...] the Germans would have won ww2.

That's debatable as well. Chances are quite high that Germany still would have lost the war (even though it would have taken longer and killed more people), because let's be frank, the USSR did most of the work."
"By your own source 
""The great French dominion collapsed rapidly after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. Napoleon was defeated in 1814 and exiled to the island of Elba, before returning and was finally defeated in 1815 at Waterloo""

Meaning he lost. Twice. And is therefore a loser"
Yeah it's treason when you're the one being rebelled against.
">Nah mate. Treason is the betrayal of your country and her interests.

It doesn't matter, you should value human lives more than your country, a place you just happened to be born in due to lottery"
"Of course its treason. Abandoning the frontline and rounding up/executing your ""own"" officers is the prime example of what was considered treason back then. Edit: And also of what would generally be considered treason today. Its also the term the ruling establishment (and thus the law) used for it.

&#x200B;

Look, you are using a tautological definition of the word. You basically say that its only treason if its bad. By that definition, yeah of course treason is bad, but it also takes any actual meaning form the word."
Why guess British. It's fact the USA was founded by traitors to their king and nation.
"I'm Danish, the British stole our navy and firebombed our capital because they were paranoid. Doesn't change facts, the US was founded through treason."
When they were erected those values did suit our society. You're looking for historical revisionism and I think it's wrong. You can add to the existing statues better context but ripping them down is nothing but animalistic symbolism.
Lmfao no. You silly communists and your revisionism. American intervention turned the tide of WW2. Hitler would have easily defeated the rest of Europe.
"Now THAT is true. I guess the use of the word really depends which side you’re on. Winners write the history, I guess."
Who said anything about not valuing human lives? Don’t be a drama queen here.
You lost me at “ruling establishment”. You have your own agenda here.
Nope. US was founded by whistle-blowers.
"Yes, and if you refer to the American revolutionaries as “traitors” you are taking the British perspective on this. Similar to how people who are citizens of the USA can call the Confederates traitors. 

Let me ask you this, different subject, would you say British history is part of American history? So Americans should refer to British history as “our history”?"
"Now they don't suit our values anymore, the world changes, historical revisionism would be rewriting history books to delete them from there as well, but such is not the case."
"> animalistic symbolism

First of all.... no.

Second of all, if it was true for tearing it down wouldn't it be true for putting it up in the first place?"
"The statues themselves are animalistic symbolism. There's no revisionism going on, there is simply a higher moral bar being used and prioritized over the cult of wealth/power that led to many of those statues getting erected in the first place."
"Ok, my position is simply that treason is justifiable, if not necessary, if it is to oppose unjust laws that does not care for basic human rights"
"Bro. You’re just throwing out key words. The founding fathers who left the British to found America, from the eyes of the British, are men who committed treason. It’s all about perspective. The founding fathers, in their eyes, are just part of a rebellion. Do you get it yet?"
"I consider Britain a motherland of sorts so yes. British history is part of my family's history. So is French and German history.

Why wouldn't it be?"
">So Americans should refer to British history as “our history”?

No, because the vast majority of the US didn't come from the UK and have no connection to it now.

If they were still a British territory like Gibraltar or even part of the Commonwealth like Canada then yes, they'd have some claim to our history"
"No, it's a statement of objective fact. Treason doesn't depend on perspective, and is not necessarily a bad thing. 

Yes, I would say it is (at least until the late 18th century), because the USA is formed directly from British colonies rebelling against the crown (and there's the treason again). Or maybe rather that early American history is part of British (and Spanish, French, Dutch etc.) history"
Yes it is animalstic symbolism whether you like it of not.
That sounds like rebellion to me
"Yes, I do get it. The post I replied to called them traitors, hence why I assumed the person was British."

Like a small child playing with a new pet, I often feel some parents/adults don't show children the proper respect and mostly play with them like they're a toy, or a product simply made for the users entertainkent (user here meaning parent/dogowner). Just treat your kids like they are actual, real human beings who know nothing of life and it is your duty to teach them what you know, so they can survive in the real world once they make it there. Because that's what it is. When you have a baby, you aren't just taking care of a little baby for a bit... you are creating a whole new person, born with literally 0 knowledge of anything, and so everything you do from that point forward molds them. It feels like such a simple concept. Maybe I'm wrong."
Wow this needs to be said?
"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will leave me with crippling anxiety well into my adult years."
"My dad used to make fun on me then scream at me when I cried, saying I “couldn’t take a joke” and to “grow the fuck up you fucking baby” and that he’d “send me to the psych ward because normal kids don’t cry over nothing “"
"Why stop at children? If ANYBODY is reacting that way to a joke you're telling, stop. Jokes are supposed to be funny. If the audience isn't laughing, it's not funny."
"Also, don’t tickle. At least don’t hold someone down and tickle them, or refuse to stop or let them up.

Even if you’re roughly the same age, not just adults to kids.  Because of the tickling, the person may be “laughing” but that can be just a physiological reaction. Many people find tickling very unpleasant. And there’s a bit of unpleasant domination to it as well

If you keep hearing “stop” - STOP."
"Man, I hated that feeling when everyone was just laughing at your suffering instead of FUCKING HELPING. Made me a hell of a defensive and angry child. On the plus side, I win arguments against just about anyone."
"Yes. Seriously. It’s seems like common sense but how is making a child cry funny? I don’t understand why people think it’s funny. IF SOMEONE DOESNT LIKE IT, STOP! Kids have so little control over their environment, it’s just not fair to egg them on."
"Raise/treat children with *love, respect & dignity*.  If you can't manage that, do your part instead by staying away from them."
"On the other hand if you see him enjoying it, just continue exaggerating the whole thing - this will continue to entertain kids no matter how far you go! Their minds and  imagination are simply different!"
A friend of my moms put pepper in her hand then asked me to smell a flower before switching hand at the last second and giving me nostrils full of pepper as my mom egged it on. I was 7 & ran straight to my room to pack my bags. Fuck them (42 now)
"Like my mom always said, ""If both people aren't laughing, then it is not funny.""

I plan to use the same line on my own kids, and it has helped me to be thoughtful of others."
It's humiliation. From the people who are supposed to protect you. Being degraded as a child over a 'joke' is borderline abusive.
"Once has an adult throw a cup of water in my face when I was younger. It came out of nowhere and it was a ""joke"". I started crying because I didn't expect it. Well, my mom didn't like the joke and went full mama bear. He tried explaining that it was just water and nothing happened. Not good enough for my mom. Because she knows I don't cry easily and know that if I do cry, something is wrong for real. 

So to all parents who see something like this happen, back your kid up. I'm not saying go full papa/mama bear on the person, but do let the person know it isn't funny. Kids can't always tell you need to stop or feel to insecure/scared to do so."
For this exact reason I don't speak to my dad
"My stepbrother used to always make jokes that were hurtful. When the person who was the butt of the joke didn't laugh and joke along he'd say, ""Can't you take a joke?""

I learned early on that if at anytime someone uses that phrase, ""Can't you take a joke?"" the speaker is an ass and the joke was meant to be hurtful. No need to ruminate over it and wonder if someone lacks a sense of humor."
"My Dad! He would antagonize me and do things he thought were funny and then when  I'd get upset he'd say, ""I was only playing!"" Has done this crap to my kids, too. Luckily, he lives far away and doesn't visit often. When he's called out on his behaviors he still thinks he's in the right. Infuriating."
Tickling as well. When a child is saying stop please stop. Many times as a child i got in trouble for screaming my head off because adults wouldn’t stop tickling me.
"the sad part is that parents who need to hear this will just ignore it because ""YOU DONT KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO PARENT (or emotionally abuse) YOUR CHILDREN!!!"""
"I think to tack onto this, if you’re doing one of those logic jokes or something that someone has to recognize a pattern within your words to understand the punchline, and they just aren’t getting it, just tell them. I’ve seen some people who don’t get social cues very easily really get upset at jokes like this and it makes them feel alienated and stupid, and it’s not worth it just to make some silly joke"
It's sad that this has to be upvoted so much.
"Shit, this was basically a competition in my family. My dad abs uncle were like the two old men from the Muppets, except they were just jerks."
Jokes aren’t jokes if someone gets upset or hurt.
Looking at you Jimmy Kimmel
Yeah kids have much lower threshold for traumatic stuff
I dont see why this has to be a pro tip it should just be common knowledge
TIL there are people who think it's funny to tell jokes to kids that make them cry
"Agreed. Stop. They'll just remember you as an insufferable asshole.  


But at the same time, don't over-coddle them either. Children need to be exposed to things that stress them out a little bit or which are slightly unpleasant. They need to build up a little bit of endurance and tolerance about it. It toughens them up and teaches them that life isn't always going to give them exactly what they want, exactly when they want it, exactly how they want it.  


Some people are over-gentle and over-accommodating, and those are the kids that hit school and can't cope with other kids ribbing them a little bit. Bullies see this and they know who to target. Ultimately, you can be setting your kid up for a lifetime of failure because you never taught them that whining isn't winning. They need to have a little bit of tolerance. Start very small. Building their tolerance can be as simple as not switching activities the exact micro-second that they ask. Not giving them something they want as immediately as they ask for it, and not following their demands instantly. Like maybe you sing a song they don't like. See if they can take it for five seconds, or ten. You can condition them to not immediately explode into a ball of fury if something isn't satisfied for them within a few seconds."
I never forgot the humiliation I felt when my family found out I liked a girl. They kept nagging and mocking me for it and from then on I had this subconscious fear of intimacy.
"If you make a joke with anyone regardless of age and they become visibly upset, immediately stop."
">From years of experience of being with family members who thought that making a child cry was “cute,”

Wat"
Or be like my dad and do it on purpose to make your kid mad. I can take anyone else on this world but my dad never fails to make me flustered.
same goes for making out
Man this sub is hot garbage.
"Genuine opinion, I don’t think is a good idea to implement as a blanket policy. If you always capitulate to a child’s emotions it won’t prepare them for the real world. I’m not saying bully your kid and laugh at their expense but they also need to understand that whilst their feelings are important, they alone won’t change anything. I think a better idea would be to raise your child to have enough courage to speak up when they don’t like something rather pandering to them straight away."
"If you're making a joke with anybody* and they become upset, stop."
Do you have any evidence to show that this helps? Because I've had the same thing happen to me as a child and it only made me more resilient to the judgement of others
"My mum and brothers used to hide loose teeth (baby teeth which had fallen out) in my belongings. In my shoes, in my pencil case, in my school uniform pocket. My brothers I forgive because they were both <10 years old but that's just one of many, many reasons I will be cutting ties with my mother as soon as I can."
"Same goes for others in front of your kids. If one parents pranks or makes a joke at the expense of the other and upsets then, and doesn't apologize or make amends, they teach that behaviour to their child, whether that is to replicate it, or expect it from their own partner."
My entire family needed this memo 30 years go
LPT: don't be a shitty person. Some of these aren't so much tips as just general advice not to be a dick.
Honestly this isnt just restricted to kids. The subject of a prank or joke should find it just as funny as everyone else or it isnt funny
Wow this post brought back a lot of memories from holidays with my mom‘s family when I was a kid. No wonder I resent all those people now.
"Real LPT, if you don’t stop at this point go see a fucking psychologist because you need help."
My parents always make me upset when “joking around” (making fun of me) with me then get mad at ME when I’m on the verge of tears.
"I think if you have to be told this, you are a shit human. Period."
It is abusive and traumatizing
"This is an example of bullying, whether done by another kid, a sibling, or a parent. It blows my mind that the schools spend so much time teaching kids how to report it to someone when they are being bullied, but spend zero time teaching kids how not to be a bully themselves!"
"My uncles used to think that ganging up on me and tickling me was funny. They (3 grown men) would hold me down (until I was at least a teenager) and tickle me until I cried. I would scream at them to stop. I would try my hardest to punch, hit, or scratch them, but they always had the upper hand.

Nobody helped me! The family would sit there and laugh. ""You're laughing, you must be enjoying it!"" they would say. The reaction is involuntary, I can't help it. But the crying was real and completely ignored.

And to this day, I do not tolerate being tickled, and yet my wife doesn't get it. She says the same crap about the involuntary reaction, saying I must be enjoying it. I've told her that it is torture to me. I have an intense, visceral reaction, and if you don't stop tickling me I will make it stop. People get one warning now.


I've made it very clear that while my son does actually enjoy being tickled, if he says to stop then you STOP. It's a simple matter of consent."
"I used to play a joke when I was little where I would say “I don’t like it....I LOVE IT!” 

I tried this with my niece when she was 10 and asked if I liked the drawing she made me. She ended up thinking it was hilarious, but the look on her face in that split second before saying “I LOVE IT” still haunts me to this day. I love you so much and I genuinely do love your drawing! Please don’t feel bad!"
My favorite is when they’re like “Aw stop being so sensitive!!!” as they’re making fun of you.
"My brother thinks is it funny to be mean to other people. For example, he taught his kids that my name is ""Uncle Wimpy"" and my daughter's name was ""Bitchelle."" When I said something about calling an infant ""bitch,"" he claimed sarcasm and blamed me for being too sensitive.

We made the mistake of going on vacation with him a few years back and it was just insult after insult out of his mouth. That was the last time I saw him.

He'll occasionally call me when he is drunk and tell me what a terrible person I am."
"I hate when people make kids cry, they are so inocents and so cute that I don't understand why some people like making them cry. Poor little boys and girls."
I agree with this. Some parents are so insensitive
And that's the reason I detest the whole 'parents pretend they ate their child's Halloween candy' joke... I don't understand why so many people don't get how damaging to the child that type of joke can be coming from their own parents
"""if what you're saying is making the other person visibly upset, stop saying that thing"" 

Wow, amazing insight into a little-known facet of social skills. This place has truly change my life."
The “it was just banter” excuse is wrong for all ages.
"Do not agree at all.

This is how snowflakes are born.

Use these things called words to explain humour to your child. My stepson has gone from getting sad about any comment he perceived to be negative (got upset if I said he was a child or correctly stated his hair colour) to being a lovely, playful boy who knows how to correctly joke around and have fun.

Trust me, when your snowflake goes to school and he cries and yells stop at bullies, they will not. They will be the absolute laughing stock and that's your fault as a parent."
"Are you...kidding me?
Is this a joke?"
"I don't think so. If the older persons will adapt themself and change their behaviour when you start crying, you Will learn that crying works and will stop your problems. This will make you a weak person when in the grown Up world you cannot cope with the fact that other people may do things you don't like without an intent to hurt you. (Like making a joke with you)"
"Um, this is how you make future citizens of CHAZ. I’d rather be the one toughening my kid up than some rando in high school or social media."
This was a major contributor to the development of my schizoid behavior.
/r/obviousprotips
Oh yeah you’re my first!
>We’re so high up on the track.
"""Suffer in silence"""
"Same for adult too though, especially someone you don't know very well. They're adults so they probably know themselves best, besides taking a joke further to the point that it actually upsets someone is not even funny anymore"
My mom used to say stop crying or I will give you a real reason to cry for. Or she would threaten to hit me so bad that I would stop crying.
Someone needs to tell Jimmy Kimmel
Seems to me this is a **really** good tip for all the parents who love to post this kind of thing on social media.
So don’t be a dick? Got it.
The fact that you feel the need to explain that may be telling of how many sadistic people are in society.
"My daughter would stamp her feet and say, ""Stop laughing, or I'll give you something to laugh about!""

...That did *not* help."
"“If you realize you’re making someone upset, stop.” Why does this need to be a tip?"
And my wife wonders why I really don’t like talking to my family much.
I mean...this extends to adults too. Laughing at the pain of others is sadism no matter how trivial you find their suffering to be.
"If only someone had said this when I was a kid. For somebody who was never actually abused, you’d think I was based on how I react around people and teasing. I got it from everybody all the time and makes it very hard not to be completely defensive at all times"
"Also don't press your fact on a stove when it's hot.

(Both of these are obvious?)"
"Yeah. Don’t do what my mother did and keep making fun of your kid while she’s crying. 

She did it multiple times throughout my life and now she wonders why I don’t talk to her very often."
"So true. It doesn’t always mean the adult is being malicious.. but it can still hurt the child. My example- I was in 2nd grade and our teacher had a write down what we wanted to be when we got older. I wrote “I want to be a principal so I can be rich.” The teacher thought it was funny (my principal was not rich) and called the principal to our classroom. They laughed at what I wrote and I just burst into tears. 

My reasoning for writing this was because I was spending a lot of time with my grandmother (actually my nanny but she was the closest thing to a family member I’ll ever know)  and she was poor, living in a trailer trying to make ends meet for her family. I guess I thought if one day I was rich I could save my grandmother like she saved me. It still hurts to this day and my teacher really was the sweetest woman, she just didn’t realize how hurtful it was to me..."
"Unless they're being selfish little brats, where they are just crying for attention"
"My ex step mother used to do this to my daughter, even though she was otherwise very good to her. She was very sarcastic about everything, often at my kid’s expense, who usually ended up crying because she didn’t understand sarcasm. She’s a very sensitive adult now."
"Ugh reminds me of my uncle  who used to pinch me really hard with his toes when i was around 4/5 whenever i walked pass him when he's sitting on his chair. i would be so mad and asked him to stop but apparently he thought it was funny and did it anyways every single time. man i wish i would just bite him, asshole"
Pussification of America
*flashbacks to the time my sibling  constantly beats the crap out of me when I was young*
@Indian Parents who think they're doing their kids a favor by hurting/mocking them so that they can tolerate hurt from others but instead scarring them coz the kids now don't know whom to trust when their own parents have fun at their expense
"My uncle always did this, it seemed like he actively enjoyed making me upset, especially when I was a teenager in an hormones rush."
"I almost got into a fist fight with my dad about this. He shoved me against the counter, and with not even raising a single hand, looking straight into his eyes, I told him, ""You do anything else, and I call the cops."" This was probably the worst I have seen him at. I love him, so I forgave him for what he did. I tell ya, I had my adrenaline pumping though."
"Come on, this is a real post? Yes legitimately thought this was a satire mocking life pro tips.

This is absolutely common sense. Not a tip. Like, basic human empathy common sense."
"I hate repeating myself and it bothers me when I see people messing with my daughter like playfully tickling and putting a blanket over her or some other game you play with a toddler after she tells them to stop. The hardest person to kind of yell at for it was my father in law. There wasnt any ill intentions or anything but I had to tell him, ""she already said stop, why do you keep fucking with her?"" He immediately stopped and was kind of stunned at what I said but it pretty much squashed that issue right away. Hopefully the people reading this are the ones that need to be told that this behavior is unacceptable."
"So, as a parent, I see things on this site sometimes that are just kind of... out of touch. The LPT here should be “don’t be a fucking asshole” rather than something specific like this. My kids literally scream “noooooo, Stop!” And look like they’re about to cry if you say “I’m gonna get you!”. Then they get really upset and confused when you don’t “get them”.

Same thing with “don’t post videos of your kids online, they can’t consent.” Again, the rule should be “don’t be an idiot.” If the video is of your kid crying and screaming, you probably shouldn’t post it. If the video is of your naked kid running around the backyard, you probably shouldn’t post it. But if it’s of your youngest super happy about “bird watching”, or your oldest singing his ABCs for the first time? Why not share it with other people who care about your children but weren’t there to experience it?

The world is not black and white, and society has gotten to the point of “don’t do x because y”. Just don’t be a fucking asshole. Don’t hit your kids, don’t torture them, etc.. The goal should be to eradicate bad behaviors, not police all behaviors."
*The beatings will continue until morale improves!*
"But, what else are older siblings for ?!?"
"When I was a kid, me and my brother normally share birthdays at my grandparents. I guess they thought it would be a good idea to do 2 partys separately one year. The party was for my brother but I wanted gifts cause that's what i was expecting when i showed up. When i wouldn't stop asking my grandmother pulled out a HEAVY box (normally for clothes), i was super excited because i felt included that day as I haven't gotten much attention.

When I get into the box, it's full of plastic bags, alright just hiding the actual gift I thought. NOPE it was fricken brick. I cried so hard and for so long. Everyone had a good chuckle and taught me a lesson about being a needy kid that can't wait.

And to this day I still don't enjoy my birthday, just wishing it was over already."
My mom had a friend that would bring out the worst in her and i was really clumsy so a few times i hurt myself really badly falling and they both laughed at me for a really long time. As an adult i feel great shame anytime i trip of almost fall to the point i want to remove myself from the people around me.
"Wow, do people actually do this?"
"My parents had grown up in post-war Germany. Obviously things weren't easy for them. But whenever I complained about anything it was held over my head how easy I have it and how much worse their lives were. Cheers guys, really helpful."
"Ugh, I wish my family had read this when I was younger. ""iT's So FuNnY tHoUgH!!!"""
"I mean unless you were my dad. It was usually to first mock my crying until I cried harder, then de-escalate by threatening to ""give me something to cry about""."
"What we may see as nothing, may be everything to a child, and later an adult."
"Some of your family members are dumbasses.
It was never  and still not cute to make a child cfy"
"This isn't really helpful, as it's way too ambiguois.

There are times you just need to sit back and *watch* the temper tantrum unfold ... and amuse yourself. Once said tantrum is over, then we can try to move forward and/or address the issue.

People need to ***feel*** a bit of pain and frustration, even pverlottle things, a d get*no* benefit from. It. This is how they learn that not all their dreams and desires and emotions are ""deserving"" of being recognized. People ***need*** to hear the word ""No"" and have it applied, in-context.

Done right, this builds solid, competent and confident adults who don't ""always need to have it their own way."""
The term you’re at the games
I think the key here is repeating this behavior is emotional abuse.
"Stopping something and validating their crying isn’t right either depending on the situation. Children will often cry for attention and you can validate this attention seeking behaviour by pandering to it.

Definitely don’t laugh AT a child crying but actively promoting them to laugh WITH you to show the situation isn’t that bad will show you are supportive of them and also stop them from developing attention seeking behaviour or believing they can get what they want by playing a victim. 

Obviously all dependent on what the joke was."
Agreed!  If someone is crying it isn’t a joke- it’s just mean   Everyone should be laughing in the end.
even the best of parents bully their own kids without realizing it
"I'm glad this is being said. I'm the youngest of 5, but my siblings are a lot older than me, so I didn't get teased as much by the eldest 2. My 2 sisters closest in age to me tormented me pretty bad sometimes, but they were old enough to know better. They would bring embarrassing stories of mine up and talk about them and make fun of me until I cried (this was nearly every single family event). One time I locked myself in the bathroom, always told I couldn't take a joke. Another time I told them ""this is why people commit suicide"". Don't remember what the response was to that, i think they called me dramatic. I'm already a very sensitive person as it is, so I'm not sure how this affected me mentally or emotionally."
My dad used to make me cry on purpose through out my childhood. The best parts of my young life was when he switched to the night shift.
My parents don't understand that
ITT: how common decency is apparently not that common
"I have mixed feelings about this: I really really enjoyed that video where the family pretended that a trick to make the daughter disappear actually worked. She freaked out phenomenally in such a hilarious way.

Now I feel guilty I laughed so much. 

If anyone still has that link, please share so I can open it and hide it from my feed."
LPT: Don't be a dick.
I was talking to my grandmother about something and mentioned what a piece of s*** Chris Brown was. My niece overheard and starts an argument with me and basically runs out of the room crying while I am continuing to tell her that he beats women and I'm trying to ask her why she's defending him so much.  I think my niece might have been 15.
I don't know if anyone needs to hear this but...Normal families don't do shit like this. Reading this was like eugh people do this? Ugh.
I was terrified of supernatural beings and monsters in the dark and my mum loved to pretend to turn into a monster at night. So yea im kinda fked up now
"Nah fuck that, they’ll be okay."
This is one of those LPTs that is basic common sense.
Or the kid could just get over it. Damn you guys are soft
"As a general rule, if you’re talking about anything to a child and they become visibly upset, it’s a good idea to stop."
If only you had delivered this advice to my family like 30 years ago....
There's a point when it's abuse but if it's over something silly I don't see the harm. If you stop doing what ever it is to swaddle your child everytime they cry about a joke how's that gonna help them later in life?
"“Don’t be mean to kids” 


Wow what a pro tip. Definitely worth 10 thousand upvotes and all these awards. Lol this website is a bottomless pit of trash"
"I think there's a line. 

I liked scaring my kids. They'd be intensely watching a movie in the thick of the suspense I'd yell ""BANG!""
We would laugh. Sometimes the kids would get annoyed. 

But then I see videos on the net, one in particular comes to mind, where they play the ""invisible prank"". Child sits on chair, parent throws towel over child, everyone starts looking for child. At first, kid is laughing along enjoying the joke, then the kid starts to believe he is invisible. He becomes increasingly frightened tugging on his mother's shirt telling her I am right here. He's following her, he's crying, he's very obviously distraught. 

They keep going. 
The child attempts sitting back on the chair and throwing the towel over himself, to be visible again, they keep pretendinghe cannot be seen. 
This continues on for quite sometime. By the time they decide he is visible,  he's inconsolable.  

Like I  said I enjoy scaring my kids. But that, that's not ok.  There's a difference between a quick boo and traumatising a little person for the sake of your own fun."
"Hmm I'm probably a terrible parent: when my kid makes a big deal over what appears to be a very minor injury (like not even bleeding, and he can't even seem to find exactly where the injury was), I calmly suggest we amputate and ask if he prefers above or below the joint?"
kids do cry over some dumb shit though
What the fuck is wrong with people that this needs to be a LPT? It's like making a LPT to not inject bleach. Anybody capable of reading should already know it.
"If you stab someone and they bleed, stop immediately,"
"My brother doesn't get this. What seems like saying something harmless can really upset kids. He said something about eating a unicorn once and just kept going on about how delicious it was and my daughter, 5, was very upset.

I've taught her to tell him, and others, to stop antagonistizing her and if he/they couldn't be nice that she would not speak to him/them."
">Continuing to laugh and make fun of a child while they are crying is confusing for them and they will feel completely vulnerable and torn down, and they will remember that you were being unsupportive of their pain.

Source? Or just something you came up with?"
"Or, just don't talk to kids. Works for me."
"i have a pretty bad memory of getting pantsed by a cousin when i was a kid and being laughed at, actually awful"
I guess we could all just remember that children are people too and making people upset for fun isn't really okay in general.
"I must say, yes, it's true. My mom and older brother was doing this to me when I was a kid. Don't get me wrong, they're the best people I know and I love my family. They simply thought it was funny. Jokes, pranks etc. that make me cry.  


Later on I was classic depressed teenage kid because my family hates me, and I have nothing in common with them and all those little stuff seemed so BIG. Like, Mom, older brother are singers, but not me, can't sing, can't make music and that seemed so fucking big problem for me that i've become more distant from my family.  


With those jokes and pranks I lost self-confidence and become introvert. As a kid I learned it's bad to tell to my family my true feelings, it's bad to tell my family I don't like what they're doing because when I did they were mocking me more even tho they didn't really meant to upset me. Later I asked and they said they thought I was joking too.  


Too much is too much. Doing this, you can lose their trust and expect lies from them because they will be simply scared of telling you the truth."
"I can't imagine the thought process of people who do this.

I have actually been in this situation: I made a joke with a friend's daughter that made her cry. My response wasn't necessarily *useful*; I apologised and panicked and passed wholly over to her mum, who was next to me when it happened. But I felt awful about it and in no UNIVERSE would I have shamed the kid for her reaction.

Unlike my stepfather, who used to be like that with me all the time when I was young. I really don't understand that mentality."
"I once went trick-or-treating with my friends and her younger sister (A) tagged along. A was scared of falling into the road, to which my dumbass twelve year old self replied 'at least it won't look out of place'. She started bawling her eyes out... :/"
Absolutely. As a child my family would joke with me to the point I was physically uncomfortable with what they were doing or saying. They would keep going and it messed me up. I had and still have anxiety from it. It got to the point where I felt like I could not open up to my family in fear they would make it into a joke. Hard for me to this day to open up to people. the loss of trust from people close to me when I was young was probably a major reason.
This is how you raise a snowflake
Beating will continue until morale improves
"Reminds me of the woman I saw at knott's berry farms.  
""Come over here so I can hit you""  
That kid kept moving away."
Or gaslight you into thinking that you are at fault
til I have a sibling!
You're lucky you got a warning. My mom would usually just burst into whatever room I was in like a Mike Tyson Kool-Aid man and just start throwing punches.
And you've never forgotten that ......
I can’t imagine the lack of insight it takes to utter those words and believe it won’t have consequences on the relationship with your child later on in life.
"I had a phase of crying to get what I wanted.

""Stop or be punished"" was both effective and warranted"
"I remember while I was on vacation at my home country, a family was getting out of their car and the little kids hand was closed in the door. Of course the kid started wailing out of pain, this mom just fkn beat him up in the middle of the street for crying. I yelled at her to stop, which she did, and I think she also got a bit scared? Idk."
"They read that book, How to make your child resent you."
Every time I was sad as a kid my parents would tell me to shut up because other people have it worse than me... now I go to therapy because I have a hard time talking about my feelings because I don't want to bother people. Parents are just great aren't they?
Ahh yes the good ole police tactic
"""I'll give you a reason to cry if you don't stop."""
"Mom, where is my jumper cables?"
and the wheel keeps spinning...
At least your mom warned you first.
"I was always told by mother to ""stop crying or I'll smash you against the wall."" That was her favorite threat."
Hey my parents did that! Childhood trauma hi-five.
Your mom warned you?   Lucky
"You aren't wrong. I was made fun of by my dad for having large feet. I couldn't wear anything but bell bottom pants until I was like 20.

I was told guys would like me if I lost weight. I slept with every guy I met because I thought that's the only way they would want or like me.

I was told ""you're still eating??"" anytime I'd put food in my mouth, even breakfast. So I hid and binged when nobody was looking for a long time.

On and on it goes. It matters."
"“Just treat your kids like actual, real human beings” uh oh, don’t say that, it’ll only worsen, if the last hundred years has taught us anything"
"Yeah... and that is why I won’t have kids... 
I am unwilling to take on that level of responsibility because that is exactly what you have to do."
">everything you do from that point forward molds them.

Your post is really well-said and I agree with all of it, except for this statement. We have a huge impact on our kids, but it's not like every single thing we do will mold them. Some things are small and some things are big. It's probably best to assume it'll all have some kind of impact, but it's not always what we think, and many times it isn't even really noticed."
"When I was like 7 or 8 my older siblings were making fun of me so bad that I started crying and finally screamed ""Stop, I'm a human being!"" They then mocked me, saying I would win an academy award for my performance. 

I don't speak to them."
"There was one of those videos making the rounds, where a parent asks a child to give them a roll of toilet paper and then wipes chocolate on the kid’s hand and makes the kid think it’s excrement. That kid is dry heaving, being sick, crying and completely hysterical. The mum is laughing the whole time and thought it’d be funny to put the video online. It’s basically child abuse for likes."
"My dad’s extended family thought it was hilarious to joke to me (a girl, 14 at the time, with poor self esteem) that they were gonna get me a nose job when I turned 16. 

I’m kinda glad they live 3 hours away and I only have to see them a few times a year."
"I never cried in front of her but whenever I tried expressing myself as a teen, whether it be clothes or coloring my hair, my mother would make nasty comments to her friends about it. Right in front of me.

That’s one of many reasons she’s not allowed in my life anymore."
"You must have supportive, loving parents haha."
"My mom used to purposely annoy me as a child, doing things like repeatedly messing up my hair, or tickling me, or any other thing that would overstimulate me, and would never stop when I told her to, or tried to get away. Eventually I would just end up hitting her, at which point she immediately got angry at me and usually punished me, but I didn't care because it got her to stop lmao"
I was an incredibly sympathetic child. I would cry anytime I saw my mom cry. She thought this was hilarious and would pretend to cry to show her friends then laugh at me for crying.
"ya my mum, dad and both siblings would regularly make me cry for jokes and get me excited about x or y thing only to tell me they didnt mean it/i couldnt have it and laugh at me for believing it was real. really minor things like ill let you drink out of this cup like your mum, or asking me if i like a certain food they had in front of me and hype me loads and then when i shyly got gassed they go too bad hahahahaha! and if i couldnt hide my upset much laugh even harder. this lpt would probably be met with a pshaw by them but i still appreciate it."
"Have you ever been on youtube? So many child abuse videos of people putting on scary masks and jumping out at their kids. Then laughing when the kids break down crying.

It's disgusting."
"Oh, yes. When i'm studying my parents can't leave me alone without making a joke about the subject i'm learning. Never funny, i always tell them to get out and then they ask why. 

Mom, dad, i can tolerate it one, two or three times because i think you are like me, innocent humans who forgot about the unfunny part of the situation. What i can't tolerate is that you make these jokes always and tirelessly without considering my fucking opinion and my space."
you'd be surprised what needs to be said to some people
There are people on Reddit who need to be told not to piss in their own pants. Apparently.
Ez karma bro
"""don't abuse kids"" OP - free karma"
"Lot of people would laugh/ joke at a kid, and not know if the kid was play crying or actually crying. Like an uncle teasing a five year old by holding something just above their head is playful, and no reason to start crying, but a structured insult isn’t as funny to a kid as it is to an adult, as they will take it personally, and seriously cry"
Imagine having a semi happy relationship with your parents
Are you new to this world? Have you seen the people that are out there?
"Do y’all not see the thousands of video snips where adults are emotionally torturing small children under the guide of a “a joke”?  It’s horrible, and far too common."
"I'm surprised this is even upvoted. A lot of reddit threads devolve into ""it's just a kid, it's no big deal"" when it comes to ""pranks""."
My grandma used to make jokes about me and if I started crying she would just go on and on. I don’t think she realised how traumatising it was for me though...
“Kindergarten pro tips.”
"Yes, some people are absolute asshats"
Please tell me you no longer talk to him or that he learned to be at least decent to you
Has everyone been watching F is for Family?
Lol tell that to my co worker who thinks nobody gets his humor. I just think he is an asshole.
"Unless the post was edited after you commented, this was already said."
This. I had family and friends pin me down and tickle me on numerous occasions and at a certain point it literally feels like torture. The person might be laughing but they’re not having a good time if they can’t escape when they’re over it.
I still can't have people touch my sides or stomach because of them doing that
"Yes, this! My kids love to be tickled. I'm careful to stop if they say stop, and even if they don't, I stop after twenty seconds to let them breathe and calm down. If they want more, I can always start again!

It can be a fun game, if you employ some, you know, humanity."
"Absolutely this.

I learned not to be ticklish, which pretty much stopped it, but I shouldn't have had to. My uncle (who was the yongest of 10 kids) was the one who let me in on that little secret."
"Unless you're my wierdo 2 year old daughter who can be tickled to the point of crying but if you stop she looks you dead in the eye and in her deep raspy _grown-up-voice_ goes ""TICKLE MORE!""."
"My mother has always tickled me and there’s times when it takes legitimate physical effort to not lash out violently. 

Obviously I know my mom is just playing trying to get me to laugh but every once and a while the joking “ haha stop “ is indistinguishable from the actual desperate “ I was already going through something taxing and this is really bothering me “"
"This 100%. My ex liked to tickle me to the point that I was struggling to breathe, but it was all good because I was laughing, right?

Fun times…"
"I’ve definitely been through this in my younger years but given that the usual was parents abusing alcohol and neglecting me and my sibling, although the tickling was unpleasant and I felt trapped, after the fact I would always be laughing.


Tickling was the least of our concerns as kids."
"My kid: ""STOP TICKLING ME""

Me: Stops

My kid: ""Why'd you stop?""


5 year olds can send mixed signals"
"I put my uncle in a leglock when he didn't listen.  Oddly, he didn't do it again."
After years of tickling I now throw elbows as a subconscious reaction. It takes effort to not hurt someone in response.
Also teach your kids that stop means stop. Enforce this rule consistently.
"If you tickle, I'm not responsible for any of my further actions towards you"
"When I was a kid, I knew another kid who'd laugh when he was in pain, actual physical pain. We thought that was pretty funny, luckily he thought it was funny too and he let us hit him for laughs."
As a kid that pissed myself when tickled yes
My girlfriend used to tickle me when I did not want it. Like I would be in the middle of a really nice stretch or something and she would tickle me and ruin it. She is no longer my girlfriend.
"My kid loves being tickled, but I am also using it as a lesson in consent.  The moment she says ‘stop’ I stop.  The instant.   Parents who tickle beyond ‘stop’ are basically telling their kids that No doesn’t mean no."
"My ex girlfriend little brother hated being tickled. I would always grab him and tickle him for a sec, but let go pretty quickly. Then he figured out how ticklish I was, and he had ZERO mercy and would not let go unless I physically pulled him off of me."
"I had a boyfriend who would do this to me. He would pin me down a tickle me, and threaten to keep going until I peed myself. He would do it until I was bruised, crying, and hoarse from begging him to stop. It was so upsetting, and I will freak the fuck out now if anyone tries to tickle me. It's not cute, it's not funny, its not fun for the person being tickled. Its legitimately upsetting."
"This is so true. A friend of mine used to tickle everyone including me until I completely seriously almost angrily had to explain why it makes me feel uncomfortable. 

He thinks to this day that I just can’t take a joke..."
"This is a great reminder. When I first had my LO, I didn't even think about this until I read it on reddit(6 siblings and shitty parents warps your sense of normal) Since then, I've always been really clear with my LO that if she says stop, we will stop immediately. She still loves being tickled and asks for it a lot, but sometimes she just isn't in the mood or maybe she has to pee or that spot is more painful than ticklish or whatever. We still have plenty of fun and she knows she has bodily autonomy."
"My mom used to hold me down and tickle me and I hated it... I did find that if I kicked her in the face she stopped.... I got in a lot of trouble both times but the second time she was like “I’m never ticking you again!” as if that wasn’t always the goal. The trouble was worth it, DONT tickle me."
"Right? This reminds me of some video a co-worker of mine showed me where a mom had like chocolate on her hands but was in the bathroom and called her daughter, maybe 4 or 5 years old, to bring her some toilet paper. As the child is handing the mom the toilet paper she touches the child with her chocolate-y hand and the child thinks it’s poop and she tries to wash it off in the sink and is literally gagging. The mom is (of course) filming this entire thing and laughing! My coworker showed me this thinking it was funny? And apparently a lot of people think this type of stuff is funny bc the video was posted on facebook. I told my coworker right away that I didn’t think it was funny at all and I felt really bad for the little kid. She looked at me like I was the weirdo."
"I think a lot of people understand not to film people without their consent and put it online.

Somehow when that person is too young to consent it becomes acceptable though?"
"The best is when they make you angry and defensive, than criticize you for always being so angry and defensive, the amount of times my parents asked me ""why do you act this way?"" When I was a kid had me thinking there was something wrong with me. Now that I'm older I realize that I learned from how I was taught by them, I acted that way because they taught me to act that way."
"Saying you should help instead of laugh at your kid reminds me of a little something. When I was a young kid it wasn't common for parents to carry water with them for their kids. If we were out at the mall or some place and I told my dad I was thirsty he would reply, ""Hello thirsty, I'm dad"" every single time. And then I would have to rephrase what I said to play his dumb little game. It really bugged me as a kid and looking back now it makes sense. Like, your kid is just telling you they need some water. Maybe instead of making a joke just tell the kid that you'll take them to get some water? How hard is that?"
"I had the burden of working with just such a guy.  He tormented his own son so much that his kid thought it was normal to be overly anxious about everything.  Then they put the kid on Ritalin to help him cope.  So what does his father do?  He steals his kids Ritalin, crushes it up and snorts it to get high.  So every month, this scumbag is high on Ritalin for about a week while his tormented kid goes without his medication.

A half dozen people report it all to child protection and nothing happens because there's no physical proof and his wife doesn't want to lose the kid, so she covers for him.

I think the only reason he had a kid was so he could entertain himself by tormenting the poor kid."
"I'm emotionally distant and impatient and I hate loud noises. My husband and I just didn't have kids, some people say I'm selfish and only think of myself, but honestly, I know that even when I try my hardest small amounts of stress cause me to lose it/ panic,  I often struggle with suicidal thoughts and I prefer being left alone. I think that never having a kid was the best thing I could do for any potential babies inside me. 

Not everyone should have kids, I think it's important to recognize when you fall in that category."
"Mother: ""please I don't have time for this""

Kid: *points gun* ""you don't get it do you? We're never gonna stop""

Mother: ""pee..ka.boo"" *starts crying*"
Same
"One time my dad didn't stop tickling me when I told him to stop cause I couldn't  catch my breath so I started flailing my legs and kicked him square in the nuts, his face turned red and he couldn't move, I thought I had accidentally killed him."
This. I am so bad on picking up subtle sarcasm and jokes that I assume they're serious and then they make fun of me when I don't get it.
"Thank you, I was just thinking that. Let's make kids cry, film them, and then laugh at them in front of millions of strangers."
"Scroll down a little in the comment section and you'll find plenty of people disagreeing with this ""common knowledge""."
"That’s definitely a job for the parents, however. A friend of mine would always tease and play rough with my other friend’s kid, and when they asked him to stop he called it “character building”. 

I always found it uncomfortable, he doesn’t get invited around anymore lmao"
Wat ar those
Tickling as a form of coercion is certainly a debatable parenting technique: I can remember being coerced into a bath for example at the threat of tickles.
"It’s actually how respect and self confidence is formed. If all children were taught respect, there wouldn’t be bullies."
"“Do not agree at all.” ..what?

So you DON’T think you should address why your child is crying? Get a load of parent of the year over here lmaoooo"
"Imagine thinking that you should keep making someone cry after they start crying

What a mega asshole jerk"
No it wasn't
"This is the one I remember hearing the most, usually said with anger."
"Our parents used to say ""I'll give you something to cry about"". We thought that meant they were going to hit us. Instead they destroyed the planet, ruined the economy, and gave us crippling anxiety and depression."
“tUrN oFf ThE wAtEr WoRkS”
My mom uses “man up” whenever she says something shitty and I tell her it upsets me.
Fucking Christ I heard that in Walmart last week
"As dad pulls off his metal studded belt. 

Yay childhood."
"Ah yes, the tactic my piece of shit cousin used last Christmas morning.

I lost 50% of my reasons to go home after realizing what a piece of shit he is. Not sure the remaining 2 people I like down there are worth the trip now."
Yay for being emotionally closeoffed!  Thanks Mom!
Childhood
"I confronted my mom about this recently and her answer was "" yeah but you were just ALWAYS crying about something, it got really annoying""  thanks mum, thaaaanks"
That’s my childhood there. If we didn’t stop crying immediately after that she’d make us hold out our hand to whack with a wooden spoon. If we pulled away we’d get an extra slap for each time we pulled away. If we cried after the slap to the backs of our hands with a wooden spoon we then get it on our bodies. I’m not sure what my mum thought she would teach us with that amazing bit of parenting
Hint: it’s the fact they you have a shitty parent.
"My mom would slap my face so hard I hit the closet with my head, and then beat me up for crying untill I stopped crying. Erliest I remember she did that,I was five. Way to harden character, and she called that effort for making me a decent man. Good thing I've met some good people along the way, and normalized out of this, and much worse shit I had to absorb, growing up in postcomunist Poland."
"Parents did this to me and still do. 

I learned to stop crying but will never respect them like the gods they try an paint themselves as just cause they did the bare minimum. 

But wanna preach about not doing the bare minimum and how horrible it is to be that disrespectful yet. 

Please remember just cause you had 2 kids doesn't mean you can treat them how you want and use birthing them as an excuse, you don't own their life. if you act like it, expect a retirement home as soon as u turn 50, no one is gonna wanna take care of you after years of already doing so"
"If I had a nickel every time I got that one I'd be able to buy several of the belts that were the ""something to cry about"".  (said this to be funny, but now I'm a little sad)"
That was usually when the kid was whining about nothing serious tho.
"To be fair, this is a valid threat depending on why the kid is crying (like if they just want you to buy them somthing etc.).  Although the implied thread should be getting grounded or somthing ofc."
And then they wonder why we only visit on holidays...
My parents said that to me all the time. Years later I found out they made me a Broncos fan...
Not terrible!
"To be fair I've never heard this said in anything but a sarcastic tone, and always found the concept funny even as a child."
"logik

unhappy? You must be happy. I'll beat u until you are happy. Why the hell would I become happy now?"
"lol depending on how long ago this was, hello. It is me, the child."
No childhood is complete without some good old gaslighting!
"Me, a 6 year old: * gets *teased* by my parents and relatives about something I have literally no knowledge of because am only 6 years old * *starts crying because I feel stupid*

My mother, an adult who wanted, and chose, to have a child: ""don't cry, sweetie, we're only teasing you because you, a six year old who's education has mostly consisted of colouring, how to add 2 and 3 apples together, and how to spell c-a-t and d-o-g, has absolutely no knowledge of this topic. We're just joking around and having fun at your expense, don't take it seriously. Now stop crying and come back so we can make fun of you, I mean *tease* you some more for being an uneducated child""

Me, now an adult: ""I literally cant take anything seriously or Express any emotion in front of anyone ever, and if I accidentally have Real Emotions(tm) that aren't overtly positive in someone's presence I get irrationally angry, agitated, and frustrated, and literally push everyone away""

My mother: ""it's because you play vidya games and dont socialize enough >:( """
"Parent - *”Stop crying!”*

Upset 5yo child - “*Ah right, ok.”*"
"I have trouble with empathy, so forgive me if this is inappropriate. 

I don’t handle others’ tears very well. Is it better to ask *why* a person is crying if you don’t understand? Or just leave it?"
"""I'm not going to listen to you if you're crying"" when trying to say what was wrong. 

There's a reason why I basically don't have tear ducts any more.

Edited to add: right up there with ""well, his father hit him so he doesn't know any better. He's not hitting you, so don't complain."" Yes, because threatening to kill a seven year old is soooooo much better. Thumbs up."
"Look, while that’s definitely true and to this day she still says and does mean stuff and would never admit she is in the wrong. 

It also doesn’t really encompass everything about our relationship, she has helped me out in other ways which have permanently affected my entire life for the better.  (If anyone cares to know just ask). 

She is tough to be around but she’s still my mom."
"Especially after they see the nursing home. Like, ""Mom, you really didn't see this coming?'"
"Don't worry, it will only have positive consequences! Discouraging a child from showing emotions and physically punishing them if they do is the best way to support a developing human being! What isn't allowed doesn't exist! It's hilarious that my parents still think I was an incredibly happy child, just well behaved and they did the best job ever. Really I would spend many nights sitting on the roof outside my bedroom crying and being absolutely terrified that someone might notice. Accidentally burning my hand just made me apologize profusely, because I accidentally yelled and almost cried (because a 6-year-old that just splashed hot oil on to their hand from a frying pan slipping from their grip has to be the most calm thing in the universe). Maybe I'm on six meds to keep me functioning but I'm always so cheerful. Maybe I've been sleeping horribly for the past few weeks because my therapist thinks I need to learn more adequate emotional reactions and we're going to start exposure regarding that, but oh boy has everything in life been such a walk in the park. Many parents just think they have done a wonderful job, especially when any negative emotions were deeply frowned upon. The kid grows up, continues to be terrified of feelings, and will just keep up the facade that has morphed in to a part of their personality. It will keep the parents in their nice bubble of ""everything is fine"", never seeing the suffering they have caused."
"That's fine, and teaching your kids not to be emotionally manipulative by ""turning on the water works"" is an incredibly important life skill.

Disregarding your kids' emotions because you don't want to take the time to understand whether those emotions are real or a form of emotional manipulation? That's hugely damaging.

I heard ""stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about"" a lot as a child. It wasn't productive, it wasn't helpful, and it was one of a million other factors that contributed to me having very underdeveloped emotional intelligence up until recently - I'm still working on it, but shit doesn't change overnight. Those habits and behaviours of suppressing emotions and pushing them down out of fear of judgement for being human doesn't go away without a whole lot of work. And I'm just one of the lucky ones who identified that my emotional state is fucked - think about all those who never do, and pass that onto their kids."
Wish that had been the case for me
"Damn I’ve got a very similar story (wont give too many details cause don’t want to be recognized).

I did something dumb and broke a few fingers in a park that was full of kids and their parents, a ton of moms and kids came to see if I was ok. 
My mom showed up, picked me up by the collar, and slapped me right in the face. Playtime is over."
negative multiplier effect at its finest
What a fucking shit head.
"I feel similarly. I want children, but I feel I need to wait a long time until I'm mature enough for such a serious responsibility."
"I truly believe that subconsciously children pick up on almost everything their parents do. A lot of the meaning as to ""why"" goes unnoticed, but they don't innately know how to act like a human in the society that we have created, so they look to emulate their parents actions. You see it in kids who take on their parents sarcasm at an early age or start using phrases their parents say a lot, without fully understanding it. The way they move, think, speak etc. is all based on what they see their parents doing. At least that's what I believe.

It's true that they miss things and don't always have the capacity to catch on to things, but I just think that a lot of people underestimate just how many things they pick up on.

Hopefully I explained that well enough. I often feel like I'm just rambling on the page without making any point lol"
"A friend once said, ""you never know when a memory is being made"" and eventhough I'm not a parent, that really struck me, had me thinking about the little things I remember that my parents sure don't, and also rang true for any situation with any person."
"I don't think the implication was supposed to be that parents should be prescient, but just that we should be *present* and aware that little eyes are on us, absorbing."
"Can confirm, 3 older brothers who made it a competition to make me cry when I was younger. No wonder I'm socially awkward"
"Agreed. My step-father is one of these self-confessed ‘stirrers’ who thinks it’s funny to confuse and upset people by being a dick.

Fortunately my 5-year-old daughter is kind of like this too and mostly thinks it’s funny (she’s an extrovert), but my 7-year-old son is like me (an introvert) and thinks this behaviour is dickish.

Unfortunately some adults don’t know how/don’t care about changing their behaviour so that they don’t piss off people (don’t worry we are just too sensitive or whatever)"
"I still remember about every mean ass thing my uncles said to me as a boy.  I also remember the time when one of them got pissed and launched a ball at my chest and I caught it and said “that’s an out” 

Then one of them has a kid and his named rhymes with a bodily function and I was ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN to call him Lucas Pukas.  Even tho....when he was little he would poop and puke because he poop smelled so bad...but I digress."
"Exactly. You hear that 10 year old, older brothers!  Stop making your sibling cry!!!"
you don’t have to see them at all. blood relations are only family if they earn it. you get to surround yourself with people you care about - who care about you. not abusive aholes.
Good for you. Some people think they're obligated to put up with their families harassment or even just their bullshit.
"I simply can not fathom sometimes that there are people who's parents didn't treat them like shit growing up. My parents had 4 kids and made it extremely clear from day 1 that we were all accidents, unwanted, and a burden. My dad clearly hated us, and would remind us constantly that we ruined his life, and that having kids is the worst possible thing you could ever do in life. I straight up can not imagine what a home life where someone's parents didnt take joy in belittling and tearing their kids down for fun is like."
"My dad would do this - like for an hour constantly at a time sometimes. I'd try to ignore him, didn't work - ask and beg him to stop, never worked - tried to get away and he'd follow me. Eventually I'd usually cry out of frustration and just wanting to be left alone and then he'd get angry. So I hate being touched or teased AND I have emotional problems. Bonus! 

I did bite him once though - he'd walked me to school so he could mess with me and the idea of my classmates seeing this shit was the last straw, I guess, so when he was poking at my mouth or something in the school yard I bit down hard as I could. Wasn't enough to draw blood or anything - I was like 10 - but I remember the look he gave me and knowing I was fucked next time we were alone in private. But he stopped!"
Wow. What an asshole thing to do.
"Nope! I live with him! He’s a little bit better but he still can be verbally abusive at times. Does not help that I’m basically 100% financially dependent  on him and he’s co-signed on all my loans for school.

He actually recently made jokes about me killing the dog when he almost choked on something (the dog is fine, was just a scary moment)"
"The title concerns children and can't be edited.

Also first sentence:

>family members who thought that making a child cry was ""cute,"""
"My older brother (I’m female) did this to me sometimes until the time I lost control of my bladder because he wouldn’t let me up and I went and told on him to my mom. After that he didn’t do it as often and he let me up earlier. Pretty sure he knew he was torturing me, when most people don’t – they think it’s just fun.

Bonus: As an adult I can’t be tickled if I don’t want to."
"I’ve always told friends and SOs I *will* swing at you as hard as I can if you tickle me. It only took once for a few idiots to realize I’m not joking.

I too had traumatizing experiences of being held down and tickled as a kid. Still to this day I don’t like being touched."
"Some people when they try to tickle you, it fucking hurts. My husband tickles people really hard. He never knew he did till he did it to me. It hurts way to much for me to handle."
"I have a creepo uncle who always used to hold me down and tickle me. One day when I was about 12 I told him if he did it again I'd punch him in the face. He did it again, I sucker punched him, he never did it again. Now he's shunned from the family for grooming an underage disabled girl. Who woulda thought?"
"Yeah I’m incredibly ticklish to the point where people would do it to make me laugh but it wasn’t any fun. I started to slip in a little elbow to the side or something and would apologize cause I “couldn’t control my body”. 
People tended to stop after a bit"
"I’m so sorry - I know how that feels, for me it was always a weird emotional pain: DO NOT TOUCH ME THERE.

I was able to almost will myself into not being ticklish. I’ve had boyfriends gleefully declare they could tickle me, but they all failed."
"Exactly! I mean aren’t there videos of chimps tickling delighted little baby chimps? It could be so fun – but exactly like how you do it, which is consensual."
"My kids BEG for tickles. I’m always very careful to do those two things as well.  I’ve been trying to use it to teach them that stop means stop. They need to consent again before I start it back up after them saying stop.  Now that my boys are old enough to tickle their sister, I’m really trying to make sure they understand this too."
Teach me how!
"Same! I learned to turn it off for certain parts of my body. Every time I get a pedicure, I ask they they not use the brush on certain parts of my feet. I’m worried I’ll kick them in the face because it tickles."
GlubGlubMotherkicker
I had one of those too!  Third time was the last.
"In another comment I mentioned that it was part of my older brother’s way of bullying me. I uncontrollably wet my pants once and that caused him to back off a little because I finally told on him to my mom.

It’s abusive if done by bad-intentioned people, but like you say there are far worse things."
"Tickling is also used as a grooming method. The tickling I got progressed into sexual abuse and to this day if I get tickled I WILL punch you.

It is certainly not the least of a kids concerns, it’s up there with “stranger danger”."
"Sounds like a good opportunity for a lesson on bodily autonomy and always respecting someone else's ""no"" even if you think they don't mean it. But, like, in toddler terms."
Good for you! Sometimes people need a non-verbal lesson.
"That bullshit invalidation - “no it doesn’t“, ugh.

Not totally related, but I had uncle who would cheat at board games when he was playing with the kids. He was an all-around dick too."
I’ve seen so many videos like that and just yesterday I found out that there are videos being made on Tik tok where you spill/throw water on your baby to see how they react. Some of them even threw water right at the baby’s face.
I get your feeling man. Kids are looked down upon too much imo.
"This reminded me of this sketch from Key and Peele, called [Baby Forest Whittaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yrZphCZcf8)."
Oh
"Yes. It's how my younger brother is raised. I was raised the other way, by my father alone, while he had a new mother who would coddle him. I am successful, he can barely function."
"Imagine putting words in someone's mouth then calling **them** the asshole for what you pretended they said.    

Google strawman.    

What a mega hypothetical asshole jerk"
Why are you saying you should keep making someone cry. As if you were bullying a child before. If you are joking with a child It should learn that joking around is normal and that you have to be strong enough to handle It. Otherwise you het egocentric children Who aren't able to maintain a social interaction which is not 100% what they expected or wanted. Learning that someone you trust can disagree with you when you personally feel attacked Will make It a lot more easy to absorbe critic in the later part of Life.
What? What do you even mean by this? Are you saying you the know the state of this person's mental health better than them?
"Ah, of course, you must be u/jdlech , right? You understand that person better than they know themselves?

Be fucking quiet, you don't know shit."
Why was this phrase so prevalent. Seems like everyone over 30 has had this yelled at them as a kid. Did our parents think it would make us better?
This guy lifes.
We get to choose their nursing home...fair's fair.
Ow.
I need to lie down for a bit after that amount of truth.
"Our parents used to say ""I'll give you something to cry about"". We thought that meant they were going to hit us. Instead they just empowered the police to hit us."
Damn.
Exactly!
"Nah, I still got whipped with a belt for crying."
Can I super-upvote this?!
LMFAO!!
Wow I can hear this so clearly. Lol
">He's not a mean person and I know he loves me

I know you want to see the best in your parents, we all do. It's why so many of us end up messed up when we have bad ones - we simply wouldn't tolerate the same levels of ongoing toxic behaviour from other people to the level that we justify with our parents. 

But I want you to know that kind, loving people don't do this:

>he frequently seems to prejudge my comments and rarely actually listens to what point I’m trying to make or take it on its merits before inevitably being negative

>doesn’t know how to do empathy properly

This is what narcissists do, which is the opposite of kind, loving and empathic. I really hope you're doing okay. You don't deserve to be treated poorly by the people you love. 

/r/raisedbynarcissists is a good supportive community for this kind of thing if ever you need it."
Sounds like you should stop wasting your emotional energy on trying to have intellectual conversations with him.
I think it was 1996. I've never laughed out loud at a stranger like that before.
yes that sound of a lighter ... memories
"Seriously though, fuck your mother. What an absolute piece of shit person. My parents were really similar, and they're just horrible people who can rot in hell."
So this is the other family my dad would always jokingly allude to having and said he would leave us for if we annoyed him too much.
Come visit us in r/cptsd sometime.
"Yes father, I have stopped because you demanded it"
"Actually, this is fairly accurate. But it depends why the kids crying. 

You want a toy another kid has? Yep gonna ask you to stop crying. 

Another kid being mean to you? Stop crying and go be mean back or play with another kid. 

You hurt yourself, I’m gonna hug them and make them feel better. Cry away."
"Maybe you don’t have kids? Here’s how that conversation goes in my house:

Parent - “ Stop crying. Deep breaths. Ok now tell me why you’re crying.”

Upset kid: umm ummm umm because I wanted to put the cat in the trash can and you wouldn’t let me. And my socks are orange today but I wanted the purple and and and.

This goes on all day every day and eventually, sometimes, you get to the point, when you’re sure nothing has happened, when you just say stop crying. And usually they do. Kids can be super manipulative. They know crying brings attention and so they do it when they’re not the Center of Attention and for only that reason."
Asking kindly and/or offering a tissue or a glass of water usually is the best thing to do.
"Personally, I hate crying in front of anyone & would rather be left alone so I can try to stop crying & clean up my face. I don't want to be comforted & I don't want to have to explain what the problem is in my cry-voice, but a tissue may be helpful. But I'm a grown adult, it's different for kids."
"TIL I'm not the only emotionally stunted person worrying about how to ""people"" properly."
"Not inappropriate at all.  Interestingly I don’t handle others’ tears very well either.  It makes me awkward as hell.  But I think you need to just read the room.  Asking why someone is upset is totally ok.  I’d also ask whether they want to talk about it or if they want to be left alone and then you will know exactly what to do.  Another thing, - don’t hug them unless you know they are ok with that.  A lot of people are not huggers and don’t want to be touched, especially when they’re upset.   
I hope this helps a bit."
"If you were crying, how would you want your friends or family to respond?"
"I just hope you arent justifying her abuse of someone as vulnerable as a child, my friend.

Let alone someone who deserves to be so important to you; like yourself.

I dont know your mum and Im not OP, but hey. You were just a kid."
If you're still upset about things she did in the past you might want to talk to her about it or better yet talk to her about it in front of a counselor or family.
"Yea, it sucked, but I'm getting better, the most freeing thing I have learned is that even though other people have worse problems, that doesn't mean my problems are any less important to me, and that by feeling sad or mad or depressed I am not automatically assuming I am more important than everyone else. I'm just having feelings and feelings are normal things that people have.

Sadly I didn't grasp this concept until I was 30. But now that I have accepted that truth, it helps with a lot of other things"
"I knew ever since I was a kid. 
I’m an adult in my late 30s and married. My friends and siblings all have kids, and while I love those kids, it has just firmly established I want none of my own. 
(You can’t give back your own when you want personal time)

I honestly don’t know how all the *good* parents do it."
"As a kid that noticed waaaaay more than everyone thought I did, I agree."
"Well hopefully my 10 month old doesn't pick up on everything because I call him a dick head all the time. In my defense, he can be a dick head a lot."
"I’m sorry. As the oldest of 7 I’m guilty on all charges. Making fun of my younger siblings to the point of crying, trying to escape them when left in charge of them, being cruel for the pure fun of it. I was a shitty sibling and a stupid kid. 

I was annoyed that responsibility of taking care of other people’s brats was pushed on me. But at the same time, they kinda looked up to me.  Realized that way too late. 

We’re all grown up now (the youngest is 16) and we made amends. I try extra hard to be there for them, guide them and help them become their best version. All it took is some time far from them to learn to appreciate what I have in my siblings. And a lot of growing up.

Siblings’ relationships are complicated, but if people keep an open heart, communicate and own up their mistakes, it’s possible to have one of the strongest and most fulfilling relationships there is. We share a bond which even our best friends cannot really compare to."
I'm the youngest in my family and my siblings had the same game with the winner being the one who made me cry. They also included our family friends so every holiday or get together would inevitably end in tears for me as 10 older kids would berate me.
"3 Older brothers but this didn't happen. We mocked each other but not to this extreme.

This is horrible and yes, for me it sounds logical that this caused you to be socially awkward... Such things stick with you."
"I was told recently that it's my fault if I'm offended and I'm still mad.

That's not how boundaries work. I'm telling you clearly what my boundaries are - respect them or get out of my life."
How did you miss Lucas Mucus though?
"The kid I was talking about was at the point of hyperventilating. That kind of stress causes anxiety disorders. As parents these people
Shouldn’t be giving their kids that kind of complex about anything, especially a perfectly, natural function of her own body. 

I have a little experience in that area. I have an aversion to being touched and it stems from people inflicting hugs, kisses etc on me when I was little and just did not want it. Now I can count on one hand the people I feel comfortable being anywhere near. 

Your example seems a bit more wholesome. At least the kid can shrug it off and move on. However, I still don’t think parents should be allowed to exploit their children by putting content on the internet they have no control over. 

But, then again I’m turning into a grumpy old man and have no children of my own so what do I know?"
"Yeah, and it’s sad. I would never let a romantic partner or a friend do this to me. My mother doesn’t get a pass just for being related to me."
Run when you can.
"I'm sorry. For those of us who don't live it, it's easy to forget that this is everyday life for far too many people."
"No, you’re absolutely right! It HURTS. 

You’re laughing and you’re saying stop but they’re not stopping and you can’t breathe and your stomach is cramping - and like I mentioned before the one time I lost control of my bladder. That was so shameful even though I didn’t cause it."
Tickling is a horrid pain. I've reactively elbowed and kicked a few people trying to tickle me. They don't ever do it again at least
">	And then if you try and defend yourself, or you reflexively kick or elbow the person tickling you, suddenly you’re the bad guy.

When we were kids and we’d tickle my dad he’d immediately start saying “somebody’s gonna get hurt, somebody’s gonna get hurt” because he couldn’t control his flailing. And inevitably when my sister or I would take an elbow or knee, he’d say he warned us. And he did!"
I thought I was the only one who had the tickle-switch tortured into them! Good to know I'm not some freak of nature.
"Same. My sides are insanely sensitive and if someone refuses to stop, I give them about five seconds warning, ""Please stop, I will become violent."" I'm not *trying* to hurt anyone, but I *will* force you off of me by any means necessary."
"As a kid I loved being tickled, but I also wanted it to stop it was weird, so I kicked around. Told my father not to do it cuz I could hit him (not on purpose). Fast forward the next day nearly broke his nose lmao"
"Yeah I started to go for a quick elbow, helped out a lot after that LOL"
"I always told guys that I had no control over my limbs while being tickled and I will not apologize if I hit them, even if it’s in the balls. 

Guys always got mad at me when I hit them, especially in the balls. I didn’t feel bad and then I knew what kind of person I was dealing with."
I wish I could reach that stage
"I try, because my stepfather torture me with tickling.

But the kids *love* it, when you don't use it as a torture method. My husband also was tickle-tortured, and I stressed his to him as well. He worshiped his dad, and it's hard for him to admit that he did abusive things. I loved his dad too, but he definitely didn't parent well."
"Very fair point, the circumstance is definitely more important than the action.


I’m just kinda high so the above comment looks a lot more dismissive than it was supposed to be, I apologise."
"It’s so fucking disgusting that somebody would turn something innocuous and fun and bonding into such abusive behavior. I’m sorry this happened to you, but I did like your strong sense of self when you said you’d knock out anyone who tried it now!

I think for my brother it was just more sadistic than anything, in general he like to see me suffer and to make me afraid and to tear down my self-esteem - stuff like that."
25 here and I have been given plenty of things to cry about.
It turns out that dumping lead into our fuels and paints and plumbing MIGHT not have been the best idea.
"I think it is because they don't know any better. I was a stupid kid once and thought adults were intelligent but now that I am an adult, I know that was just too naïve of me."
"Yeah I feel like old skool parents did a lot of stupid shit. Maybe modern parents do it too, I don’t know? Like, shit that totally defies logic and is obviously counterproductive. It’s so weird. Like some confusing Twilight Zone shit that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever lol"
"How could they not? Name any sort of power dynamic that doesnt get better with violence or the threat of it.

/mandatory S"
Over 30? No. I’m in my 20s and I grew up hearing that.
16 here but I can still relate. Dad refuses to change and uses this behavior on my little sisters too..they're 6 and 4
"Because thats what their parents did. 

My dad and my wifes dad are like this even with my son. My son has epilepsy and needs seizure meds to stabilize them, my dad told us we shouldn't give them to him because ""its all poison and will hurt him"". My wife and i roll our eyes. 

My FIL always says we need to beat our son to keep him from acting up, again we roll our eyes."
"Oh, I won't be paying for a nursing home..."
Hey I work at a nursing home have some mercy
Mine set up a plan for that. All I have left to look forward to is shitting on graves.
Make sure you got insurance for that. Those places will bleed you dry.
"Lol, my parents will be in for a surprise."
He’s not mean but I think he is a mean person
"Hello, I was born in 1996 and I'm here to make you feel old :D

*Prepares for someone to do the same to me in 24 years time if reddit still exists then*"
This is the biggest thing missing from this thread. Sometimes crying is an absolutely ridiculous response (I like your example) and should be discouraged.
The post is clear about what context the child is crying.  Its referring to parents teasing a child not parents disciplining or otherwise appropriately parenting a child.
"I think there are a few of us kicking around 

I know you didn’t ask, but I’m sure a lot of this comes from being raised by my grandfather. Very much the “men don’t cry” type, and it was only really us, so there were never any tears. 

He meant no harm, of course, but his methods didn’t age well into a world far more in-tune with its emotions. 

I still struggle to outwardly show how I’m feeling a t any given time, and honestly, I would’ve even know *how* to express a lot of the feelings I’ve been going through recently (thanks 2020, thanks London riots. Stay classy Manchester). I don’t have the words or the actions, and the professional opinion on that has simply been “I was never shown how”. 

It all kinda came to a head when I married an empath. She’s taught me a lot, but my insides still churn when she’s in tears and I can’t do anything practical to fix it. 

Tl;dr: Peopling is difficult."
You must not get on reddit much because it's full of people with the same issues.
"One just needs to make sure to ask the question in a calm and polite way. I've been asked this question while crying when I was younger and it was obvious by their tone that they were annoyed by my crying. I don't know what is is, but some people just get angry and frustrated when people around them are upset.

 It you can't avoid sounding annoyed then just ask if you can help. If they say no. you leave them alone."
"Thanks for this. 

I’m working on it, and I feel like I’m getting better, but sometimes I just feel like an alien in a human suit when anyone starts to cry. Especially my wife. I want to help and generally just end up making things more stressful. 

I’ll get there!"
I haven’t cried in over 2 decades.
"Not a chance haha. I’ve tried (and my brother as well) and it’s never ended up well, she would either tell me “oh poor you, you’re a victim” or completely deny something happened. 

It’s better to keep our distance and our interactions to a minimum."
For real. I respect that decision. I wish having children wasn't pushed as such an ultimate goal
"Lmao probably not. I more mean small mannerisms at that age, since they dont really know what dickhead means. I dont really know though, although i can imagine that most babies tend to be dickheads"
Wow I just now realized I had a big role to play in doing this to my younger brother too. We have a good relationship now but I think I should sit down and apologize for treating him harshly when we were younger. Thanks for opening my eyes :)
"I'm glad you realised and made the effort. A good sibling relationship is one of the most wonderful things life has to offer.

I always got on so well with my brother, we were inseperable. We always helped each other with any struggles the other was having. I miss him every day."
"I feel this. I'm the oldest of 8. I wasn't very kind to the first 4, but I got better and the bottom 3 idolize me. It's actually amazing, watching them chase their dreams in a way I couldn't until recently. The top 4 are mostly ok now. They understand the situation better. Fortunately, I was never outright cruel or vicious to any of them, just mean and impatient.

I gave up most of my teenage years fighting my parents and and co parenting my siblings. Could have done so much better, I just didn't know how or really want to."
"This sounds like a page from my diary. I wasnt close to my siblings growing up. Our age differences put us in very different social and development groups. Being the oldest puts a lot of strain. Luckily, they sort of always look up to the older sibling and family is forgiving.
I wasnt the best brother but they still love me and I'm better for it."
Don't be too harsh on yourself. You were a kid too. I am happy to hear you made amends and are supportive of each other as adults.
"I've always been cruel to my siblings (I'm the oldest). My sister (middle kid) was acting with me like I was some sort of god (not even jk), and I hated that as I wanted to be left alone. I was trying my best to be cruel to her to keep her away. If something would happen that my parents will try to ""cover"" (like when her puppy died) I would come and tell her the truth as it is (but tbh I wouldn't exaggerate it as the truth was enough to make her cry). Years later we become best friends and she always says I was more of a parent to her than our parents, and she loved my way of parenting although (I quote her) I could've been more ""diplomatic"" about it. Now (she's 14) she actually understands what I was feeling and she's not mad at me, surprisingly. She is super empathetic and mature and I'm not saying it bcs she's my sister, she does stupid kids mistakes but she actually understands so much more than I remember doing at her age. You as the oldest teached them something and they teached you as well. Ik we can't make up for the ugly things we did but kids are super forgiving and surprisingly they understand so much more than what you expect if you really talk to them. My sister doesn't have any obvious mental illness or anything that you'd expect to have after me being a bitch to her pretty much all childhood,  she's actually super friendly and outgoing, with many friends, and as a little child she was totally opposite, the most introverted child I met."
"I too am the oldest brother of a large family and uh... All in our 20's & 30's, we regularly don't talk to our see each other for years at a time. And when we do get together, it's like we never left, which isn't a good thing. 

Anyway, if anyone's in this thread thinking of starting a big family, please, it's a bad idea, don't do it. The more kids you spawn, the less likely any of them are to do well. Invest in one or two you can be proud of, not half a dozen disappointments."
"I didn’t. 

Lucas pukas mucus alamazookiss."
"This is incomplete advice. I prefer: If you can't change the people around you, change the *people* around you."
"I have elbowed and kicked people too. I warn people, and if they try it that’s their own fault. I don’t mean too, but I know it will happen because I literally cannot control the flailing. I once kicked my husband because he tickled my feet and I just instinctively jerked my foot. He’s elbowed me in the ribs because I tickled under his arm and I had it coming, absolutely 100% my fault I got elbowed. And you’re right, they usually don’t try again. I don’t tickle him anymore, he doesn’t tickle me, and we both know that if we tickle the other person, it will probably hurt like a bitch and we have no one to blame but ourselves."
"Love your description of it! 

I imagine it’s just time after time strengthening of muscles, like someone training for a race.

All I have to do is imagine my brother tickling me and my core muscles contract almost involuntarily."
You are 5 seconds kinder than I am!
"I don’t remember exactly how I got there, but it includes wiping all expressions off your face, stifling laughter, and clenching your core muscles – like around your ribs.

Your brain gets messages from your facial expressions. If you deaden your face your brain can actually get calmer (i’ve use this in other cases, like refusing to grimace while in pain, relaxing my brows when I’m angry instead of knitting them together in the middle). 

It is super hard to suppress laughter, especially when tickled. It takes practice, like any other skill development.

Cora clenching is easier, and maybe the key. If you tighten those muscles they’re less likely to feel a light touch as ticklish. At least in my experience."
"I actually stumbled laughing while reading your comment, out here walking my dog. No worries at all. I hope you didn’t think I was minimizing very real and damaging abuse, especially for children at the hands of parents dealing with addictions."
"Wish they just hit us. Instead they destroyed the housing market, wrecked the economy and voted in a load of ass holes to stop change happening. Way to play the long game."
24 but we grew up poor which is basically the same thing as growing up a decade prior
20 here and me too!
But why was it so popular? Was it in a movie or tv show?
"I think 'disciplinary' abuse is dying out more and more with every generation, but it's a cycle, so I don't know if it will ever really end. It's crazy that parent's actually believe they're doing what's best for their child, I know... I think most level-headed people can't imagine laying a hand on a child at all, let alone a crying one."
Soylent Green it is.
"Hold your coworkers responsible for any mistreatment you *may* see please! I do t have any elderly parents yet but I hear a lot about hat treatment in homes. Not sure if it’s a bad rap, understaffed like the rest of healthcare, or the truth, so take this with a grain of salt! 

Not trying to upset anyone :)"
"If you don't claim the body, you don't have to pay to bury them."
"Haha, as if you have 24 years to wait for that. Enjoy the next four years, afterwards you’ll lose touch to what younger people do and like, your back will start aching (not constantly, though -yet) and people who you think are your generation will call you sir or madam."
"There’s no crying in baseball. For real though I cringe when I see other kids get coddled when they cry for stupid things. You don’t or shouldn’t be crying as an adult for things, it’s better to instill that in your kids when they are young or you are not doing your job preparing them for reality. You cry for pain not for want."
"The original post, yes. Not this one. I agree with the original post to the sub."
"That’s the thing: you don’t need to “fix” someone crying. If it’s not because you did something bad, all you really need to do is sit there and listen with no judgement. 90% of the time I don’t say things but people tell me I’m “a great person to talk to.”

It’s a bit odd cuz I never feel like I do anything. But me not saying anything is what let’s them vent."
"""She's in tears and I can't do anything practical to fix it.""

That's one of a few reasons I'm divorced.

American Midwest, German pig farmers. Crying and expression of intense emotion isn't practical or helpful to getting ""the job"" done, if you're going to cry go do it in private so everyone else can focus on the important things.

Of course I got into Metal Music and Martial Arts to help vent those emotions in a productive way but when my girlfriend (also DEEPLY empathic and very emotional person.) starts crying because I held her hand in the car or picked up something heavy for her I'm extremely uncomfortable and my immediate instinct is ""Find what made her cry and strangle it till it stops moving."".

Of course she's just crying because she's extremely happy but I only cry at commercials with elderly dogs and videos of Vets surprising their children at school so my brain has to take a few minutes to figure out she's not angry at me, she's just one of those people who cries at the drop of a hat."
"Personally I prefer to ask ""can I help you?"" Sometimes people cry for reasons they can't name, sometimes they don't want to talk about it. Oftentimes when people cry they do wish to be heard, though. Just someone to listen them say 'I feel x' and maybe console them with a gesture of simply listening - a shoulder to cry on. 

Some people cry to settle emotionally, out of frustration, anger, or sadness. Personally I don't cry out of joy much but some people do that, too. Crying is not dangerous, but I get upset if someone cries and I want to help them!"
"Agree completely. And sympathise with you.completely. When I was a little girl, my dad, who to me was a huge, angry man, would yell at me if I cried.  It would render me completely unable to stop crying."
"Good luck with it kind commenter. I think it’s quite lovely in itself that you care so much. 
It might also help for you to remember that the person crying is probably feeling even more awkward than you are at that moment.  Kindness always wins."
"Yeah, shit. I mean to apologize something I did to my brother for a year now and never get down to it.

I know I'm gonna get some messages now but I want to do it in person.

The first step is acknowledging it. For most of us older siblings we were just kids too with little experience in interpersonal relationshils. Doesn't make it ok, but it's all about correcting it as good as we can."
"Good of you to do this. But remember, kids are harsh, and still need to develop social skills.
The fact people will address it at an later age shows you probably developed these social skills. (Last part is a joke of course)."
"I might be too dense, idgi  
could you elaborate?"
Could you explain this? I don't really follow
Ok I was hit and shit still happened so that's bulllshit.
"Probably something their parents said to them too, then we all grew up with fucked up emotional control and decided to try the exact opposite."
"I’m thinking their parents said it to them, whose parents said it to them. It was a cycle."
"Exactly. Or at a minimum, at least not freaked the fuck out about the government collecting their information and filled out the fucking FAFSA! Now I'm still paying on a loan I could have been done with 10 years ago bc I went to school late so I didn't  have to involve my folks...."
I like how it started with some spec of humor and just lost more and more of it as the comment chain went on.
"That and ACTUALLY LISTENING to what they're saying are usually the top two reasons people say you're a good listener. You don't have to even respond a lot of the time, just listen and be there. Also helps change any preconceived notions you or they may have about each other from negative to positive, or at least neutral."
"Also why I'm divorced. 

Hardcore military asshole dad. 

Ex-wife would cry when I went to work. Ex-wife would cry if I bought her something nice as a surprise. 

She was a great person. Hope she's doing great.

But i am too emotionally stunted to understand what the fuck is happening and it fucked me up."
"If you can’t change the behavior of the people around you, you need to change who you are around."
" If you can't change the people [their personality] around you, change the people around you [the people you spend your time with]."
"I'm sorry this made me laugh. 
Hope all is well now"
I think what he means is he would rather be beaten than have to endure the world they gave us. Obviously we can't change the past
I don’t buy that justification. If millennials have the self awareness to try and be better and more ethical than the former generation then boomers had that ability too. They’re just assholes.
"I absolutely feel you on this! My Dad (good parent) died in a car crash two weeks before my junior year started. I was a straight A student. Mom was a terrible parent. Took all the money from workman's comp and social security survivors benefits to fuel her prescription med addiction. Worked my ass off to take care of my little brothers. College was 100% paid for after first semester, but I needed my mom's tax info for the financial aid. She refused. College told me my only options were to get married or have a baby...at 18. I knew better than to do that. Mom refused for my middle brother, too, but she did it for our younger brother. There needs to be a way to financially emancipate yourself from your parents after you turn 18 for kids like us."
"My ex-wife was pretty emotionally damaged in her own way. Deeply concerned with other people's opinions about her and how others view her. Meanwhile there isn't a person alive or dead who could hate her more than she hates herself.

There's a lot of good things about her, otherwise I would never have loved her in the first place but I'm not the type of person who worries what the random people in a gas station think about my phone's ringtone going off in public and I sure as shit couldn't care less if my neighbors don't like my lawn decorations so that was basically doomed to fail before it started."

Hello there
Very funny meme sir see you in hot
"Did you ever hear the tragedy of the kid who leaned back on his chair? I thought not. It's not a story the students would tell you. It's a teacher legend. The kid who leaned back on the chair was a Dark Lord of the leaning, so powerful and wise he could use the Force to lean back on his chair without falling and cracking his head open...He had such a knowledge of leaning, he could even keep the ones he cared about from falling off their chairs. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

He became so powerful...the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice pushed him off his chair. Ironic. He could save others from falling off their chairs, but not himself."
Remember the story about the kid who took drugs and peeled his hand like an orange? That kids name: Skywalter.

"In high school a friend of mine was leaning back on her chair and fell back. Her head hit the power outlet behind her, cracking it open. Turns out, if her head had hit it about an inch to the left, she would have been electrocuted and died from it. They had to turn the power off for half of the school while they fixed it. Moral of the story: the dark side is bad"
Why did you cover the commenters name? let him have some 'clout' as the normies call it
My teacher just told me that there was a student who leaned back fell and then he could only taste soap
"I was the kid that slipped. Didn’t crack my head open, but I did get a concussion and have migraines to this day."
I have two scars on my lips from tipping on my chair.
I remember when my teachers told me about that kid. Didn’t stop me doing it.
"In Pre-K, I was that kid. I always leaned back and one day I fell on a sharp box. Went to the hospital with part of the neck slightly open. Stitches were not safe so they used a weird kind of staple I had in my neck for eight days. Funny thing is, I still lean back on chairs."
"I cracked open my head doing that

*and **lived***"
"I don't like school chairs... They're rough and coarse, and my swamp ass gets everywhere!"
I leaned back and fell and cut my head on the corner of a bookshelf in 3rd grade but didn’t die so IN YOUR FACE MRS. NELSON

I was in a chemistry class room back at high school and we had tall lab chairs. Before an exam I leaned back and lost balance. My head smacked the column behind me and I went down. After a few seconds I got up and found a huge pool of blood behind my head. I was rushed to a clinic that was open and a doctor was able to put stitches to the back of my head.  I was even able to come back and do my exam. I actually did really well on that test (and I hated chemistry)"
I mastered the chair-lean-balance in high school english class. Pretty sure i broke the minute mark once. That and remembering Pi to 50-something decimals is about all i got out of high school...

"In middle school we ALL leaned back in the chairs on a daily basis. It was only a matter of time before someone fell, only this time the legs of the chair actually folded under due to the constant stress put upon them. It happened to a girl who was pretty insecure about her weight so she was doubly embarrassed, even though it could have happened to any of us."

Comment
Also His ex secretary Disha Salian committed suicide four days ago ... Seems there's something we dont know ... Regardless we lost a good actor
Irony his last film was about his son who want committed suicide because he couldn't handled the pressure. He saved him in the movie however he wasn't in real life
"Not a good year for Bollywood at all. Depression is said to be the cause. His former manager committed suicide two days ago as well. People please take care of your mental health.

Edit: changed manager to former manager"
"A talented and hardworking actor. There were several rumors flying around for the past few months about him. I don't know if they are related to his suicide.

His filmography had more hits than misses."
"He was a fantastic actor and quite successfull with great potential ahead, quite disheartened with this. 

Rumours are he was suffering from depression. Lets see what news comes out. He hung himself in his room.


Everyone, call your loved ones. Take care of yourself and your loved ones. A simple phone call can do wonders to save many lives. Tommy dreamer at wrestlemania 17 was saved by ONE phone call from jim Ross. His plan was to shoot himself on live ppv and he was suffering. But ONE phone call was all it took to save his life."
"Damn, he was from my college. RIP"
"One thing that breaks my heart is that his movie 'Chichorre' was meant to show us that suicide is not the answer.Why did he have to go away like this ? 

RIP"
"If you haven’t please watch his movie Sonchiriya, definitely his best performance. RIP"
"PR firms and Entertainment websites have ruined Whatever is left of Bollywood. 
Blinds Hit Jobs needs to be stopped, rival PR think it's cool but it's not"
"I'm heartbroken honestly .None of the recent deaths in Bollywood hit as hard as this. Knew him from Pavitra Rishta days back when my Mum and sisters would religiously watch it. 

He was also a handsome and a good actor who successfully broke through the nepo barriers of Bollywood. Will be missed dearly."
Heartbreaking stuff right there. A genuinely good actor who could've been the next superstar. Fuck! It's just so disappointing. First Irffan khan and now him. At this pace Bollywood will be filled with talentless actors
"He had so much potential. I just read one of the most respected actors of my country died, then I open reddit and see one of my favorite new bollywood actors is dead. Fuck"
no.....
"I only knew him in P.K. with Aamir Khan, he seems like a cool guy

He will be missed"
"Depression is no fucking joke. 

Reach out to people you think are struggling. There's a lot of good intentioned campaigns about getting people with MH issues to reach out themselves but it can be next to impossible. 

When you're struggling to get our of bed or even brush your teeth, talking to people is just far too much to even consider. 

Check-in on your friends, even if they don't reply theyll know you're there and that can be enough."
"In the UK, the journalist's code of conduct explains that when talking about a suicide, details of the suicide such as how it happened and emotional retelling should be avoided in a report. 

It was interesting to see the comprehensive retelling of events leading up to Sushant's death in the India Today article. 

It happens in a another article linked on India today, the article paints the scenes of Sushant's last moments, the people he called, how he went through his morning routine before 'his last breath' in that apartment. 

Just wanted to know what you guys think, is India today alone in reporting like this? Does it bring some benefit to readers to know what he used to tie the noose? Its a massively touchy topic and I know its sensitive. Would love to hear everyone's thoughts.

&#x200B;

My thoughts are with Sushant and his family. Rest peacefully."
"I was a fan of his work. Really sucks man.
He was also really intelligent and achieved a single digit rank in the All-India Entrance Examinations which is no easy feat.

RIP."
So they had to duplicate his room key before they could get inside? How about just breaking the door?
"I don't know who he was, but it is always saddening when someone takes their own life."
"He was a really good actor and was actually smart was a top ranker in engineering exams in india , always loved space and was a kind human being . One of the outsiders to make it to bollywood he didn't deserve to go away like this :("
I hope people in India stop stigmatising mental illness already and start providing the help people desperately require to battle mental health issues.
One of the few youngsters in the industry who dares to do something different everytime. The guy could act very well but didn't receive enough appreciation from the stupid nepotism filled industry. Shocked
"Hadn’t seen him much outside of the MSD biopic, but he was really good. This really sucks losing a talented person like that."
"Just want to say to all the ""wHOO posters?? ""  literally every human being is a who and nobody in the larger scheme of things, so  if u have nothing positive to add or to do a simple google search just stfu ,  being  edgy doesnt do anything other than  showing you are a asshole . Be kind or stfu toxic bitches ."
This the price for rampant nepotism. Likes of Karan Johar hold some responsibility for the situation in bollywood.
"I read he had a scholarship admission to Stanford University around graduation time, but joined acting instead."
its  heart breaking and sad! I loved Sonchiriya and his act in the movie. RIP
"Truly sad man
He was so cheerfull and talented he struggled a lot to get where he is or was today
I guess you never no what's cooking inside someone's head no matter how cheerfull or healthy that they seem at first glance 
R.I.P you will be missed!!!"
Heartbreaking! I liked his act in sonchiriya. RIP
"I'm not familiar with him, was he in any movies that are known in the western world?"
Was literally watching Sonchirya yesterday and was wondering when we would get to see him do some more serious roles. He will truly be missed
"I've been struggling with anxiety over the past 6 months. A graduate of engineering, currently out of work, alone in my hotel room, and a freakin' ceiling fan over my head; Reading this article gave me chills. Rest in peace to this man."
Nepotism is straight up destroying Bollywood and we can't do anything about it.
Why is it that the first thing some people do is spend money on giving an award to someone who just copied and pasted a link to let us know
Who?
"Omg it's soo sad to hear this .I just fell in love with Dhoni movie and his acting skills. He was such an interesting ,energetic and humble person .just couldn't believe this news . MAY HIS SOUL REST IN PEACE"
>You need to have their suicide carried out*
I think I am going to be off bollywood for a while.
Feeling shocked and sad. He was a very good actor. We can't comprehend his mental condition but it takes a lot of courage to commit suicide. May his soul rest in peace. Om Shanti.
He had more hits than Ranbir Kapoor...the Nepo Gang /GayMafia of KJo is to blame.

What has been going on in Bollywood recently?
Sounds very much like they're linked. Theories?

[Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/bollywood-actor-sushant-singh-rajput-commits-suicide/articleshow/76368753.cms)"
"Not necessarily any conspiracy, it’s very common for people to commit suicide after someone they know does."
hmm there is something in that too...but its too soon to speculate..
Never heard of him.
"Robin Williams also starred in a movie sort of about suicide 5 years before his death. In the movie Robin Williams’ character’s son dies performing autoerotic asphyxiation on himself, but Robin Williams plays it off as a suicide. It’s about all the fake people acting like they loved the kid because he died when really he was a total piece of shit. Pretty good movie if you ask me."
Ironic. Be could save others from suicide but not himself.
Oh man he always seemed like a funny cheerful guy. Depression is an unpredictable bitch.
*former manager.
Mental health has nothing to do with him being attacked by media and his career ruined with fake slander.
What rumors?
"Yeah, suicidal people tend to have a very hard time calling others for help. They're often too deep in the hole already to even consider it.

Even small things like making a call or someone saying something nice for once can go a long way. (Compliments are free.)"
I remember him coming to visit Maggi baba back when I was studying in the same college. RIP
And my school
Offtopic but glad to see my college alums/students around here

"Those damned privileged families can go ahead and commit suicide because they “didn’t work so hard”. 

Btw its working hard that kills you, it comes with the assumption that you’re about to reach some mystical promised land if you make it, the main thing that changes when you make it is people go from being assholes and indifferent to you to being fakely nice and wanting to be around you and those that see through the charade get depressed, you’re still facing ALL the problems you had before, health, relationships, potential of now losing the money gained. 

Its all a joke and all society needs an overhaul."
">One thing that breaks my heart is that his movie 'Chichorre' was meant to show us that suicide is not the answer.Why did he have to go away like this ?

I think if you're an actor long enough, you don't see the ""messages"" that movies send.  It's easy to be jaded and see films as just another job, one in which you pretend to be someone you're not and say things you're not obligated to mean.  

Hell, in the US, Hollywood hypocrisy is rampant (Harvey Weinstein went unchecked for practically forever, and damned if you think you'll see a gay leading man in the near future, and let's not get started about how inclusive Hollywood claims to be until it has to shunt out black and gay characters for acceptance in China...)

But yes, this is sad.  I don't even know much about the guy but given what I know about India (even if they did away with the caste system in the last 20 years, I'm pretty sure it's so culturally ingrained that the nepotism charges in this thread hold some weight), it had to be a son of a bitch for the guy."
My favourite film of last year and one of my favourites of all time. Absolute powerhouse performance. I'm so distraught rn
"Incredibly beautiful performance of him, i loved the role."
"I was in tears at the end of that movie. I don't think I will ever be able to bring myself watch it again now.

Everyone please do watch *Sonchirya* it is an excellent Neo Western and Sushant Singh Rajput, whom many had underestimated for starting off as a soap opera actor, really shows the depth of his talent."
"I Second this, a must watch of Indian cinema
His performance make this tragic movie come alive with hope"
What's Blinds Hit Jobs?

No I don’t think anyone benefits from the details.  Unless they somehow bring peace.  Like if someone left a note that makes it better- that could have benefit to share but not what he used for a noose.
"Journalism is hurting for money. It's business model has been usurped by Google and Facebook who have monopolized ad revenues. So news papers and TV media resort to clickbaity or sensationalized news to generate revenue. It's not just India, but US and other parts of the world"

I think that you will be downvoted for that comment but everyone actually thinks that too.   Like. Not a real star.  But he’s still human so we should care.  Always bizarre when the rich off themselves.   They must be so sad.  Maybe if they used their money to do good in the world they might find peace.
..is this a bot?
Him
"He was a outsider in a industry full of nepotism, he was naturally talented and had a bright future ahead of him."
Why even comment that?
have some compassion.
We all make regretable comments from time to time. It's ok to just delete it and move on man.
"Oh hey look, another ignorant American who thinks everything on Reddit revolves only around America. World would be a better place if fellow Americans are more progressive but oh wait there's this son of a bitch."
Shut up ya ignorant cheeseburger asshole
Read this guy’s other comments .... he supports trump and speak like a dimwit .... not worth getting riled up over his words guys ... obviously a chut
Why does reddit allow racist comments like this to be publicly visible?
A very popular 34yo actor in the film industry of a country that has 1.3 billion people. Kapish?
"He's a popular Bollywood actor who acted in some recent hits like PK, MS Dhoni's biography film, chhichhore etc."
How is it like to wake up with that little brain of yours? Assuming if you even have one.
"Put a ""Proud apathetic racist cunt"" in your resume."
Yeah but we're not talking about America here.
"That usually what happens when someone commits suicide, yes."
i think that level of PC is just not sensible...it is what it is.
"To give further context, it used to be a crime to suicide. This is why we used to say 'committed' because it was a criminal offence until relatively recently. It's obviously not the biggest deal, but it's more appropriate to say suicided or died by suicide absolutely."
Why are you acting like a troll? The guy died and your happy????
Alot of big names in the industry have passed away in recent months. And combined with the pandemic things are really bad there
"Death of 3 actor's including him and 1 singer/music director, irrfan khan due to cancer, rishi kapoor due to health conditions, wajid due to corona and sushant due to suicide all around in 1 month, and his former manager also died 6 day's ago due to suicide."
"Generally part of a pretty intense smear campaign and had movie opportunities drying up.

For anyone who is not familiar with Bollywood, nepotism is rampant over there, and is one of the reasons why the MeToo movement failed in Bollywood. Sushant isn't part of the 'nepo circle' and has had a lot of fake allegations thrown out at him. I'm not surprised he was suffering from depression considering how horrific and random some of these fake allegations are

If you are interested about the smear campaign then check out r/BollyBlindsNGossip. Here is a [comment which succinctly sums up what he was going through](https://www.reddit.com/r/BollyBlindsNGossip/comments/h8qmc1/fuck_bollywood_and_fuck_all_the_revenge_pr_this/fuscxl5/)

[This wonderful discussion post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BollyBlindsNGossip/comments/fi8aux/all_blinds_about_sushant_in_past_one_year_can_we/) by u/EccentricBai also lists some of the allegations against him, and how outrageous some of them sound. This post and its comments is what really convinced me and many others that he is being targeted by false 'blinds'."
I have an easy hypothesis: true love.
They made a suicide pact and he honored that pact...because he is an honorable man
"Case in point, chester bennington."
Worlds Greatest Dad is the film. Really dark but a terrific film. You forgot that Robin Williams character was a writer and wrote a very well written fake suicide note that goes viral
"Yeah, but that movie gives a strong message. Children age 16-18 often prepare for JEE which is the biggest examination for engineering in India, students often fail the test (1% selection only) which results in depression and suicide cases. I myself failed that exam and watched that movie to calm myself. I am so shocked."
"Imo ""What Dreams May Come"" is much more impactful and relevant to that subject than that one."
Not the right place for Palpatine quote.
"If you are good at it, you can hide a lot.  

Looking like a cheerfull and happy person is easy, once you do it long enough.  
Becomes second nature.  

And also, there is a whole lot of truth to this robin williams quote...  

“I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy because they know what it’s like to feel absolutely worthless and they don’t want anyone else to feel like that.”

Seeing suicide as viable recourse is a mental health issue by itself.
Stop with this conspiracy bullshit. His career was going great.

Check this out, but crux is nepo heads and PR heads use blinds to reveal the secrets or low points of actors/actresses. They also try to promote fake rumours so their image goes down. It is tough to assess which is true or false, because if you call something out as false and something not, then that means the other is true, and it's basically an inevitable loop."
But Bollywood still has talented people like nawazuddin siddique
The article mentioned people calling a locksmith who made a duplicate of the key.
"Indian, American or British it doesn't make any difference a life lost is a life lost regardless he will be missed by his family and friends."

[Suicide terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_terminology)  
>Per reportingonsuicide.oeg, ""Certain phrases and words can further stigmatize suicide, spread myths, and undermine suicide prevention objectives such as 'committed suicide' or referring to suicide as 'successful,' 'unsuccessful' or a 'failed attempt.' Instead use, 'died by suicide"", 'died from suicide', 'died from/by mental illness,' 'suicided,' or 'died from/by _________ (the mental illness from which the victim suffered i.e. PTSD:Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Schizophrenia).'   
While common, Lebacqz & Englehardt argue that referring to suicide as an act ""committed"" is hazardous to ethical clarity. Others have also argued in favour of alternative language regarding suicide, both in the interest of moral and ethical precision, as well as scientific and clinical clarity. A United States Navy report urges against the use of the term ""committed suicide"" on similar grounds, asserting that ""suicide is better understood when framed objectively within the context of behavioral health."
This. Exactly for this. yay!
"The pandemic thankfully isn't as bad as let's say US but yeah, places like Delhi and Mumbai are at stretched insanely. There's no beds basically and state govts of both states are busy playing PR games.

The rest of the country is fairly better and bangalore is handling it better than anyone.

Our mortality rate from closed cases is on par with Germany according to worldometer"
Also Sridevi from a few years ago and the bucketload of theories that came from her death.
"A lot, not ""alot.""

Two separate words."
"Damn, it's like India's 2016."
i wouldnt say the movie opportunities were drying up...chichhore was a hit and he had a movie that was about to release this may..
The man was worth 8Mil. He started from TV he knew the struggle of being in no 'nepo circle' this seems unlikely.
"His career going great, what are you even talking about?"
The post you linked is just a bunch of people saying you are full of it lol.
That comment didn’t really say anything
"Bollywood is total shit. They don't appreciate the good actors. The good actors don't get any movies. Many of them are bankrupt. But bollywood is busy selling actors who literally have no skills are in acting profession. 

Eg: Saif Ali Khan's daughter, Sara Ali Khan. She is nothing. My grandmother can act better than her. 

Another example: Salman Khan. He literally have experienced his flops back to back and still he makes crap. 

Good actors example: Johnny Lever. A remarkable person with great expressions and comedy skills. He doesn't get any movies. 

There are many examples. Only those people who have fair and bright look, who are considered as hot and sexy, are the ones which bollywood really cares about. Rest everyone can go fk off. And people in the country also love to watch these stupid pieces of crap!
Same is happening with the Songs in bollywood. People are in love with stupid senseless songs which are totally tuned by the computer. Only very small amount of movies have good and meaningful songs. Rest everyone makes just about any shit.


It's pretty obvious why people commit suicide in bollywood. Because most of the times it's the shitness which excels in bollywood."
literally the only time I hear about Bollywood here on reddit is when an actor has done this
Not this shit again in this sub. No details on why he  committed suicide. Your hopeless nepo propaganda is completely out of line at this point. Let people mourn him. Stick to your drama in the Gossip sub.
"I am all for dragging nepotism in bollywood and everywhere . But , I don't think nepotism is responsible for his suicide . He had 3 releases last year including Chichhore (which was a big hit) and one movie gearing up for release . We still don't know the reason why he committed suicide . Just don't use his death to hate on something you don't like ."
"> For anyone who is not familiar with Bollywood, nepotism is rampant over there

like hollywood with jews."
Who else committed suicide related to him?
"Yea I just read the plot and was reminded that’s what the movie was really about, but I guess the way his classmates were acting is what really stuck with me. And yea - terrific film - gonna have to try to rewatch."
What is the obsession with the exam? Are engineers highly paid in India compared to other professions?
"People make jokes to cut tension of serious situations. 

It’s fine. 

I’ve been in surgery before, seeing a patient pass away, and doctors start cracking jokes about it to ease the tension.

Life’s hard enough as it is. It’s okay for people to connect with others through humor. Especially by quoting a movie in r/movies."
For you
But it potentially removes blame from those responsible for pushing him this far. Like that kid whose ex girlfriend pushed him to commit suicide. Would he have been this depressed if there wasn't a smear campaign targeting him?
A lot of this looks like smear campaigns
India has a MeToo movement?
I am from 2k20 batch. I saw him 6 months ago walk right past me surrounded by tons and tons of people when he had come to the library to get photos clicked. It's pretty shocking and unreal for me.
Not a time to joke bud
Well at least you were considerate enough to omit the exclamation mark
"If you dont have anything good to say, pls don’t comment. It’s a delicate situation."
There are lot of talented actors in bollywood and on the contrary some nepotism products are also talented actors...
"nawaz and sushant weren't competitors exactly. diff age, diff kinda movies."
Because you don't like subtitles.
"Yet you still feel the need to comment? If you don’t care then why care enough to comment about something that doesn’t affect you? 

You’re not commenting because you don’t care, you’re commenting because you’re trying to be an asshole."
Why bother commenting then in the first place
"You're no better, you just assumed I chase Bollywood. I don't, but I also don't go around mocking people's tragedy. So RIP to that actor, there's that."
Not to be pedantic but Bollywood is also really big in the Middle East. A decent population in Switzerland is also aware of it due to one actor.
Username checks out
"Guess people in a committed relationship are sinning? 


Other than that ""committed"" is not the right tense. ""Commits"" suicide is the right tense."
"What ‘we’, exactly? 

It’s just proper English. Saying ‘he died by suicide’ makes it sounds like an accident or something that ‘just happened to him’, like as if a tree fell on his head. 

Someone commits suicide. Then he dies. 

Let’s not downplay it by choosing some political correct bullshit wording. If saying ‘he committed suicide’ hurts anyone and maybe prevents even one person of committing suicide themselves, that’s worth it."
You need to establish who 'we' is in your comment.
Then may I ask why you are so happy that he is dead????
"Unfortunately I don’t really think the numbers coming out of countries like India can be compared to countries like the US. The US has tested far more people, and the virus has ravaged through densely populated Indian slums where people sadly don’t know or aren’t able to practice proper pandemic safety measures.

Also, even the official count in India is flying upwards right now. The US has been dropping fast for a while. Hopefully India levels it off soon but there’s potential for it to keep getting worse."
"I don't know why it wouldn't be as bad in India, where people work in restaurants with no running water in the bathrooms, and bathe in holy rivers as dead bodies float by.  India isn't exactly a place I'd expect to have better sanitation and disease prevention education than the US"
Not bad because tests are my being done and country leaders are lying about numbers. USA is the only first world country with real statistics.
That's a lie man. Bangalore isn't reporting it fairly enough. They're testing based on a last reported basis. Commercial areas in Southern Bangalore are opening up though testing isn't as evident as it should be. In Mumbai most people are being tested regardless of area.
It’s about to get a whole lot worse
Great time and place to bring politics. Well done my woke comrade.
"Only problem with this is that they're not.
Good bait"
It’s like everybody’s 2020.
"Let's be honest, he deserved many more opportunities based on his success than other actors. Despite all the critical acclaim he received he was still very underrated.

I think he did fairly well in terms of opportunities *for an outsider*; but if an insider delivered the performances and movies that he did, they would be flooded with offers."
Was it? Yeah his movies were successful but it were mostly due to his own performances. He wasn't getting any big blockbuster type films or films of the calibre he deserved.

Salman Khan had the most important blessing in his formative years: the Mumbai underworld
"Dude, I've seen Johnny Lever in atleast 50 movies what are you talking about. Yes he doesn't get big roles but actors like him never do. He's great in small comedic roles, and he gets them."
[This Wikipedia article explains it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_item)
"I agree that the r/BollyBlindsNGossip subreddit is a bit crude and does tend to hate on some celebrities such as Deepika too much. However, I personally found the amount of fake, weird, and randomly horrific blinds linked to Sushant quite shocking.

I also think it is important to raise awareness about the problem of nepotism in the Bollywood industry. Nepotism has hurt many good actors' careers and denied talented artists a chance to step up their work, and the proof is very much there if you can be bothered to dive deep into it."
"Not too sure what you mean?

Too much nepotism means that secrets don't get revealed, and whistleblowers and victims who speak out are instantly shut down and don't get any work. I honestly cannot see the Bollywood industry vulnerable to any campaign in the near future."
Chris cornell from soundgarden

"Oh, man..."
Are you 12?
"In 2011/12, he just started making fame, so people didn’t know much about him.   
My mum just told me he came during my brother’s time too(2k13 batch) he was regular.  
Just petition college to hold some seminars on depression and suicide, this is still a bit taboo in india to discuss, i have experience with this.    
This effects people much more after a celebrity does it. Especially when you are associated with him like this."
Wait till you hear about hollywood and nepotism.
What an ignorant thing to say.
He's one of those guys who think doing that is cool
Good point.
Your reply is irrelevant. Just because you don’t mock a tragedy doesn’t give you the right to assume someone’s identity based on their comment. It’s disrespectful to Americans.
"Not any more, just letting you know"
"It's not what is said these days, have some consideration"
Anyone who respects people and lives in current year

Are you new?
"This is like when people say 'China is doing great compared to the US and the UK.' Well, duh, they're lying about the numbers."
"Recently lost a family member in Delhi. Officially been told he had tested negative, even though he had all the symptoms for Covid. So yeah, I agree with you with regards to the data."
The govt can hide cases but definitely not q massive spurt in mortality. There has been no such spurt.
"Don't worry, India's only been a bit late to the coronavirus party. They started getting it about a month after USA did. They're currently in fourth place for total number of cases and rising. 

I doubt they'll get higher than number 3 though. It would take a truly stupid country to fuck this up as much as Brazil or America."
"U.S numbers are also not trustworthy for that matter. Perhaps Countries like South Korea and Singapore who flattened the curve might have been more precise with their numbers, but there's no way every country is fair with all the numbers, because even how faithful they're with the numbers, some cases might still slip under the radar. Asymptomatic cases are the one hard to notice."
"Lmao sure. My sister is a Frontline worker and my dad has connections in a major city.

This is just a cynical narrative. It discredit the work our medical professionals do."
"The situation is still not as bad as the US. However, I won't call it good unless we hit 0 cases."
"I mean you can check the excess deaths data if you'd like, it's not far off official deaths from covid. Every single country has accusations exactly like yours, almost all are unfounded. .."
I think the deaths would be reliable regardless of testing protocol. In India 9% of daily tests come back positive. India's mortality rate for closed cases is 5% which is on par with Germany.
"Except if the virus was ""ravaging it's way through slums"", there must be mass mortality and there has been no such mass mortality."
"The US tested more people because community spread was prominent there. If India had community spread then India too would have tested more people. Thankfully, there's no community spread in most of India. Also there are more doubts on the credibility of the numbers that the US is reporting rather than India.

"As much as we love to shit talk it. India wiped out Polio and other diseases faster than any western country. Unlike the US most Indian people surprisingly follow the rules, the police enforce them strongly and legislators make sure they get done, even if its not ethically done. Indian speculative nature seems to effect most of the actions that take place, which is why you won't find people protesting to wear a mask."
"India dealt with other pandemic really well aswell.

In India, 9% of tests roughly come back positive even if we get cynical about numbers.

There haven't even been 10k deaths in India so far."
"Ehh active cases in India so far are 140k total.

Total deaths in us are 117k."
ya but that could have been his personal choice depending on the scripts or money ...we dont know much about it..in 2019 he did 3 movies and 2020 he had 2 movies one of which is an adaptation of fault in our stars...so he was getting decent number of projects and some of them were hits...
Why is the focus between “outsider” and “insider” in your post? Does this apply to the Bollywood film industry in some way? Genuinely curious
That doesn't sound like a drying up career at all.
"Nobody is bound to give you movies you think you deserve.
His films were doing well, he was famous, well liked, big fan following, making good money. He had everything. Stop with the conspiracy theories."
"Much more thorough, thank you"
"From the existence of a sub called BollyBlindsNGossip, I take it that this a regular thing in India?"

Can you  stfu and stop the pretense ?  This is not the time to bring up the nepo discussion, that too without any facts out there. There are so many parameters out there that could have  resulted in his decision to commit suicide. Speculation or worse, pushing your agenda without knowing enough is so disrespectful to the whole situation.

"Well yeah, they're hiding because everyone's in on it. But there will be an outsider or a disenchanted individual who will eventually out somebody and the media will get involved

I believe it is you who flaunted his ignorance in your earlier comments.
What the fuck do you even mean? You'll get a pass if English ain't your first language but if it is you need to give up your highschool diploma.
He is :)
China probably is lying about their numbers but they also are an authoritarian country and can do things like force lockdowns unlike other countries so I wouldn't be surprised if they have corona virus under better control.
"You should look up the numbers of cases of swine flu that the states reported vs the CDC models of the outbreak. Huge discrepancy.

In my state they reported several hundred cases when in reality there were millions."
the US is demonstrably lying about the numbers plenty
"If we're going to assume both the US and China are lying about their numbers, China *is* doing great compared to the US.  The lockdown in China was enforced with great prejudice.  Don't you remember all the headlines and reddit comments mocking China for their ""authoritative measures""?  It paid off.  Meanwhile, people in the US were out there protesting the lockdown, not wearing masks... call me a wumao or whatever but that's a big difference in approaches."
the US is demonstrably lying about the numbers plenty
"No they're not. China WAS lying about their number. They literally have covid under control now. They managed to test the entire Wuhan region in two weeks. That's EVERY CITIZEN. Wuhan is now open, so are other provences. Hospitals aren't swamped, that's a fact. People aren't rushing to the hospital, that's a fact. So, don't trust the numbers they release, how about you trust the condition on the ground, and people's lying eyes? China is safe. US is the worst hotbed in the world.

You don't have to cover up US' disastrous response by bringing down China's response. Aside from the initial period of trying to cover up the disease, they've be insanely efficient in curbing it."
The US eradicated Polio 30 years before India. There were millions of stranded migrant workers when the lockdown happened that had to travel back home and no doubt spread the disease. The US is testing at 17x the rate.
">Unlike the US most Indian people surprisingly follow the rules, the police enforce them strongly and legislators make sure they get done, even if its not ethically done.

What are some examples of where they enforced the rules? And does the police treat India's minorities like LGBT people or Muslim people fairly?"
"> Unlike the US most Indian people surprisingly follow the rules

Shitting openly in public spaces, gang rape, child rape, child marriages... yeah? I can list more."
"The US has tested at 17x the rate of India. India is barely testing, that's the only reason cases seem so low."
"Sorry but he isn't getting movies of the calibre that he deserves. One of his upcoming movies is with Jacqueline who is struggling a lot; his most recent movie, Chhicchore, had Shradda in it who is also currently struggling. Check out his other 2 upcoming films, the truth is that movies befitting his status aren't being given to him anymore. Sushant deserved to receive BIG films for the big hits he had delivered.

It maybe could have been his personal choice but I find it very unlikely that it is. Apart from Abhay Deol, I can't think of a single very popular actor who purposely wants to do more low key indie films."
"I think there is a divide between an insider and an outsider in the Bollywood film industry, but in my comment I was more referring to the 'exclusion' that Sushant specifically felt in the industry. I have no clue why, perhaps it could be jealousy from another actor, but Sushant has definitely mentioned this candidly in an interview.

On the other hand, a 'nepo kid', or rarely someone else who has networked very well within the Bollywood industry would be treated totally differently."
"Insiders are powerful circles in Bollywood who control the industry like a cartel, wrong them and you are done. Also most top actors are interrelated. Only places where outsiders can shine is where real talent is needed e.g. singing , music. Even some singers are targeted.

Unofficial most powerful groups:

1. Karan Johar and co 
2. Aditya Chopra and co. 
3. Salman Khan and family
4. Shahrukh Khan and family
5. Amir Khan
6. Kapoor extended family
7. Akshay Kumar and co
8. Ajay Devgn and co
9. Corporate houses like UTV, RSVP etc 
10. Bachchan family etc.
11. Balaji Telefilms , Ekta kapoor and co.


Other than above once upon a time Mumbai underworld had big hand in Bollywood. Now it has become more corporatized.

Almost all are related. 7 and 8 became powerful only recently to stand by themselves. Almost all important people are part of 1 or more of these circles.

Sushant was an outsider and rare case of still becoming successful. Apparently he ran afoul of 1 but there is much more to this than what meets the eye.

Many talented people who rose up had their careers killed by powerful folks. Vivek Oberoi, (still an insider), Shreyas Talpade etc.

There is a singer who was all rage once and still is - Arijit Singh, he had to apologize to Salman Khan the actor because of some perceived slight.

TLDR: For a long innings in Bollywood you need the hand of an insider above you."
The bollywood industry is controlled by a group of families. Most of the stars come from these families.
I don't necessary think so. I would more say it's a regular and well known thing amongst Bollywood geeks and people working directly in the Bollywood industry.
"What ‘pretense’? I’m not sure if you’ve been following Bollywood, the muted discussion of Sushant’s hits, the fake blinds that keep popping up every month or so. How the fuck is all of this right? It honestly disgusts me.

Sushant himself has admitted in an interview that this sort of exclusion does hurt, and if it contributed even 10% to his depression then we should be outraged."
I can only hope and pray you're right.
Almost every famous actor is related to someone else in the industry. Those who did make it by themselves are far and few.
Google any famous actor and look. That’s all I would say.

I guess as long as they can add in how much better they are doing than the US, it’s justified."

I don’t doubt it but can you demonstrate?
If the US is lying then everyone is. The fact of the matter is that accurate statistics on covid are hard to get.

"That's what I said, there are clear doubts in the numbers the US is reporting. And India's numbers are much lower than the US despite a higher population density. Things are bad, of course, but not as bad as the US here."

Dan Radcliffe and Robert Pattinson do that a lot
"I'm not making the kind of money I think I deserve. Does that mean I'll kill myself and somehow my employer is responsible?
Don't be daft.
He was very successful and 99.99% aspiring actors would kill to have a career like him. Just because you think he wasn't getting the kind of roles he deserve doesn't mean he'll kill himself over it. I don't know why he killed himself and neither do you so stop pretending like you do."

Nah I’m not wearing my mask we’ve all been inside long enough dude don’t be a pussy about a flu”."
"Lol, there was no lockdown here. Some businesses and churches were forced to close, so people just went to the ones that were open. There's no sense of social responsibility in this country in any amount that actually matters."
Quite an eye opening article. Wish there's an updated version.
"You are in Reddit echo chamber, it must felt awful to get down voted for asking people to trust their own judgement."
"Authoritarian measures do work, though.  Do you reckon America would be in a better situation with COVID-19 if they had been more relaxed?"
"There are clear doubts in the numbers India is reporting. The US has tested 17x as many people. Pretending the Indian outbreak isn't a major problem and being hidden is putting your head into the sand. I don't know why everyone acts as if the US has it the worst or is underreporting the most, because neither of those are close to being true."
"Amazing isn't it? How closed off people can be.

India is my favourite destination by a long long way.

I am British Indian. India is a complete shithole. Glad my grandparents left in the 50s.
"I agree. If he was getting big budget films without any issues, then of course he would’ve done them.

The problem is that he didn’t want to circlejerk over the Bollywood insiders in order to get a big budget film. That was indeed his choice and it was a good choice."
Yeah aha I should have clarified I meant Bollywood only. Hollywood is a whole another matter
"I'm afraid depression is complicated, there is no 'one single factor' that contributes to it. Perhaps the death of his mother, the suicide of his ex-manager, and the COVID lockdown would have all contributed to this situation. But I can assure you that injustice, not reaping the full rewards of your hard work, and being heavily excluded in a nepotism-infestated industry can tick off anyone."
"Nah, just plain old nepotism."
It's just plain nepotism.
"It’s so fucking frustrating. I want to be completely locked down but with the way my coworkers, employer, and partners ex-wife/mother of children behave...I might as well not even bother because it won’t make a difference. Everyone is so fucking selfish. Ugh."
"You missed my parent comment - there is no community spread across India. And while the US hasn't officially announced theirs, it's evident from numbers that there is community spread there. If India did had even close to the numbers that the US is having, then these patients would have come forward by now after six weeks of lockdown, hospitals would have been full of people. But that's not the case, thankfully."
"It's a country with a very rich culture. Hope you learn something interesting, and I hope you enjoy your trip!"
"Thinking it's all about that choice allows that type of industry to exist. It shows it's systemically ""just how it works""."

Getting downvoted by people that have to pay for Netflix lmfao and never seen a call sheet."
"Sure but again, a lot of this is speculation on your part and your comment which sparked this entire chain was you claiming that you knew why he killed himself. I agree with the other guy - you don’t know why he killed himself and it’s arrogant to think you do. Half walking back your first comment to say it “ticked him off” is just lame."

Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, Russia under Stalin, Germany under Hitler, China under Mao Zedong, Bolivia under Estenssoro, Brazil under Bolsonaro, the Philippines under Duterte, and the United States under Trump - to name a few.

The action of destroying the press is as old as any dictatorial coup all the way through history."
"Well, if they keep attacking journalists it won't be seen after a while"
"There’s a whole lot of shit that has been happening at a “scale we have not seen before”.  Assaults on our election process, assaults on government oversight, assaults on our free press, assaults on America’s soft power and standing in the world.

There’s one party responsible.  Vote and make them pay for it."
"Since the police refuse to protect and serve, the press should hire private, armed security for their own protection."
This is what sliding into fascism looks like!
Wait until it gets hot. Lines are being drawn ...  This has just been practice.
It's like we are in Russia. Trump truly is acting like a dictator
"Well then Journalists, you had better step up your response to this bullshit, and start reporting, writing, investigating and documenting as if your life, and the life of the nation depended on it. Because it does."
It’s almost if someone in a position of influence has been constantly labelling them as “enemies of the people”....
"Watch... some police are going to start saying “What about us, we’ve never covered riots on a scale like this before” or “we need more training” 

Maybe they need anger management help."
Lol you asking trump to defend what he called “fake news”? Good luck
We have seen this scale before. In Hong Kong. For over a year by now. So we can compare the American police to the CCP grunts.
"Countdown until reporters start 'disappearing'.

Then intellectuals.

Then opposition.

Then......"
So who is in charge of the police is a real good question.
That’s what happens when you leave the first amendment itself as the perfect solution to fascism. It gets steamrolled.
Maybe it's because they've been told that the media is literally the enemy of the people for the past 4 years.
"Amazing what happens when violence breaks out, and the president calls the press the enemy of the people."
"Trump supporters are complaining that it is unfair that Trump is getting blamed for problems that have existed for decades, even though Trump is ignoring or excaserbating them. But the violent reactions to the press is definitely a direct result of Trump. Calling them the enemy of the people and suggesting violence (but he would never do it, wink) are a direct attack on the first amendment."
"ctOS is getting out of hand. Time for DedSec to step in, I guess."
As if it is a surprise that the alt right has become the alt reich.
It's because Trump has demonized the press.
You don't need to be a watchdog to make that conclusion lmfao
considering that 6 Companies own most the world's Media - seems like a few of those 6 Companies would try to keep their journalists safe.

"Honestly wondering the breakdown of who committed the assault and which news organizations were impacted. 

I believe (no data so no citation) most assaults are by police but I know there was a report of a Fox News reporter dealing with an angry crowd (you know - because fox was mainly looking to tell the story of the Antifa Uprising in 2020)"
Looks like a normal saturday in Paris to me
What country are we talking about ? Iran??
At least they got a good premise for Watchdogs 3 now.
"Russia, US... hardly can tell them apart. Indeed communism in US nowadays bears as more polite touch."
"Those attacks on journalists seem to be coordinated by the state, part of an overall policy by trampy's administration - please correct me if it aint so;

Nothings gonna change when you burn and loot local stores but leave local police stations  and government buildings alone.
Not sure if they’ve heard of the country “Turkey” before but I’m glad the scale of all moral dilemmas is based on America
start telling the truth then
Makes for better ratings!  But I doubt that has anything to do with the spike in arrests.   Far be it from news outlets to pander their content and and actions towards ratings and political influence.
"Kinda feels justified after all the misinformation spanning decades don’t ya  think.

dumb fucks don’t kill the messenger"
"I hate this fucking shit. The protests are getting smaller when they should still be getting bigger. We are not going to get any change. It's going to be the same shit 20 years from now. This is all to get Biden elected and get Trump out, not actually changing anything about how our nation treats black people. You just want to win an election, so like always you feign support for change, you get who you want elected and then black people are forgotten again. In fact, the Democrat normally implements some shit that hurts black people, but everyone champions it, because it's a Democrat doing it. Like cutting welfare, and forcing poor blacks to purchase health care they can't afford."

Leftists don’t like free speech or the freedom of the press.
Journos are not a protected class

What's the fallout going to be when/if a journalist is killed?
"If you think it's terrifying now, wait and see what they do when there are no longer journalists covering them.  This is a very intentional effort to get cameras off of them so that they can stop holding back on protesters.

A friend tried to sue over this in federal court and get an injunction stopping this behavior. The judge denied it. Here’s the legal opinion: https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/treatmentofthepress.pdf
"An actual attack on democracy, from our own police, and utter silence on the right.  Fuck the police, and fuck these fascists."
What's worse is that it's out of date. This article was updated on June 3rd.
one thing doesnt change is that pigs is knocking about journalers
"There's a reason you don't see many reporters embedded in a combat zone.

Guess they don't teach that any more."
Yes usually they are shot dead in Vietnam or In Middle East.
A friend of mine is a journalist and despite wearing a huge sign on her back that said media she was on the ground being zip tied until people started telling them she was media and they let her go.
When there are no journalists remaining they can make more wild claims about violence that cannot be as easily disproven.
Trump proclaimed Journalists the Enemies of the People. Cops overwhelmingly support Trump. That is what’s happening here.
"Yet journalists continue to use newspeak like ""police involved shooting"" to cover for their crimes."
Gestapo style
"Two weeks ago I watched a gang of police thugs arrest a CNN reporter and his crew live on air and for no reason - 

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCiNktCUFVA"
"Really not defending the cops, but one of the problems is anyone with a cell phone camera calls themselves media. They have a lot of people claiming it that are not documented media sources."
Journalists aren't journalists they are leftist activists spewing propaganda
"To sharpen your point a bit, the trend toward attacking journalists isn't coincidentally during a time when journalists are being demonized by the Republican Party and conservative media. Police, on average, are more conservative than the population as a whole, therefore they're more influenced by people who tell them the press is the enemy, rather than a neutral arbiter of truth, or an ally. If Republicans would stop vilifying the media, something tells me they wouldn't be a target for police nearly as often."
"FOX won't work because Trump is already thinking they're being too fair and balanced, which is a joke. OANN won't work because they just shill for Trump.

Journalists are being attacked because of Trump.  He's spent the last four years setting this up, and I guarantee he revels in every ""fake news"" media outlet and journalist that is attacked."
Trump has spent the last 4 years calling the media fake. His first address as president attacked the press. He wants them to be thought of as the enemy of the people. You can’t undo that overnight.
"""These aren't my voters""...

Stop pretending FOX and OANN are just like CNN. They are pure ultra rightwing propaganda with almost no news content. They so bot give a shit if real journalists are in danger.
He says they’re the enemy but he wants their approval so badly.
"Fox maybe possibly probably most definitely won’t ever happen.  

I will shit skittles before OANN ever came out and supported cnn like that."
"All journalists now say “I’m with fox!!”

Like many Minneapolis photographers started saying “I’m with WCCO” knowing the the police union president is married to one of their anchors"
Let's just ask Putin to stop the disinformation and come clear!
">Media unity

Yes"
"Trump doesn't control law enforcement, that would be mayors and governors (mostly in blue states)."
I think this is precisely according to chapter 2 of 'Dictatorship for Dummies'.
"It doesn't need to be coordinated. It's become axiomatic among Trump supporters that journalists are ""enemies of the people"", and most police officers are Trump supporters. Stochastic terrorism is more than enough for his purposes."
The police union has a hand in this I suspect.
"But what could be the purpose , what are they trying to achieve?  distracting from the real cause by creating another issue. Or may be they are too powerful and showing their strength?"
">must everything be politicized/partisan

In 2008 the Republican party implemented a strategy of opposing everything Obama wanted so that he would be a one-term president.  In the intervening years this has evolved into taking a polar opposite stance to everything the Democrats suggest or want.  They have forgotten how to be anything other than an opposition party, abandoning all of their previous ideals.

Throughout Obama's presidency he kept extending olive branches and trying to work with Republicans but got his hand slapped every single time.  Then Republicans started electing politicians that had drank the Fox news Koolaid that was meant for the voters and it has just gotten more and more extreme. 

So now, if Democrats believe there is a virus, Republicans *must* believe it is a hoax.  If Dems believe that masks help, Reps *must* believe that it is a ploy to destroy democracy.  

I'm trying not to be partisan myself, and I do see the issues that exist on the Left, but the Right has lost its collective mind.  It started in 2008 and snowballed.  Then when they elected Trump the snow ball turned into an avalanche of irrational stances taken solely for the purpose of opposing what Democrats support."
It’s crazy to me how my life mattering is considered “political”.
Because the right wing are mostly wrong and they don’t like to hear it
Because one side is taking direction from their dear leader and their “trusted” media outlets.  The are simply taking the stances that they’ve been told to take... facts or evidence be damned.
"> Also, must everything be politicized/partisan????

Well, something becomes Politicised/Partisan when its the subject of disagreement between politically relevant groups in Society. Everything's Politicised because everything is up for debate.

> The press is (theoretically) the free press. Masks are scientifically proven to reduce the risk of Covid. Why are these situations seen as us vs them?!?!

On Masks: Because the American Right is religious. And so it has demonised Scientists and Higher Education. And so the Right can't follow Scientific Advice without compromising its foundations.

Also, if it follows the Scientists here, they're granting prestige to the Scientists they're already studiously ignoring on, say, Climate Change. And Evolution. And Trans People. I'm sure there are other areas.

Also, When Segregationists (Eg: Racists) lost the Federal Fight on Civil Rights, they switched their Rhetoric to States Rights, then ""Small Government"" (which means to them, in reality, no Welfare Government) and ""Anti Government"" (but only when it does things they don't like) and also a very self serving reading of Constitutional Rights (For Example, did you know the US Constitution never explicitly bestows the US Government with the powers to detain, arrest, imprison and even execute people? A strict ""Text Only"" Interpretation of the Constitution, therefore, would demand the immediate release of all persons Jailed or Imprisoned by the Federal Government. Once we step away from a Text-Only reading, their arguments become patently self-serving rather than principled.)

It's actually very useful to at least publicly believe in these things, because you can object to anything that fights against racism or promotes Racial Integration on the (seemingly) principled Grounds of preserving individual rights and fighting against Tyrannical State Power, rather than fighting to preserve Racism and Racial Hierarchy.

(And of course, the you can wrap yourself in the Flag and Patriotic Rhetoric whilst doing so: Land of the Free, We were founded in a fight against Tyranny, Bill of Rights etc.)

However, no one sits everyone down and tells everyone ""Our Rhetoric is actually about Segregation and fighting Racial integration. We don't actually believe in it."" So people do start believing that all Government is bad. Which means that when the Government says ""wear a mask, stay home, it'll save people's lives!"" People hear ""GOVERNMENT TYRANNY!""

Radical Individualism has also been embraced in the name of preserving the extant (Racist) Hierarchies. If you simply *deny* the presence and relevance of Systemic and Social Factors, insist that it's *all* on Individuals, then Systemic Racism doesn't exist. And if Systemic factors don't exist, then the Government can't intervene to alter them. And even if they did, the Government doesn't have the right to intervene anyway.

(This is why you see so many Racists insist that Black People are in some way or another inherently more criminal, more violent, less intelligence. Because if *these* are true, then the factors of Systemic Racism can be ignored and denied.)

But these positions require denying that your actions can manifestly impact another without a specific intent on your end. Because if your actions *can* manifestly impact someone without a specific intent on your end, then Radical Individualism is flawed: Systemic Factors exist. If Systemic Factors exist, then it is right and Logical that Government, in its privileged position, can influence them.

If Systemic Factors exist, and Government can affect them, then Systemic Racism exists and can be pushed back against by Government. Which is what we've been trying to avoid all along.

So, deny it. Deny Covid, deny the use of Masks, deny the right of Government to combat it. All in the name of preserving Racism, the existing Hierarchy.

But why? Why give so much for *that?* For the same reason that the Slavecatcher Patrols, who consisted of Poor Whites, would affect reprisals against Slaveowners (Eg: Rich Whites) who were judged as being too lenient on their Slaves: Because that Hierarchy and their place in it gave them pride and power. The Rich Whites needed them, to Oversee their Slaves, catch their runaways, provide skilled labour such. The Poor Whites got jobs, secure and decent living and the Poor Whites got Black People.

Black People, who the Poor Whites could lord over, use and abuse as they saw fit, Lynch when it took their fancy. Black People, the fear of whom justified the Poor Whites' abuse of them, the existence of whom gave the Poor Whites their social status and power in the Hierarchy.

There's a common joke/question in places like /r/beholdthemasterrace of ""Why is it that White Supremacists are always such Pisspoor examples of their proclaimed 'Master Race'?""

The answer is, I think, because they've got nothing else to be proud of. And when Racism ruled, they could be proud.

> Why are these situations seen as us vs them?!?!

Because they *are.* Between the people who want to degrade the existing racist Hierarchy and the people who want to justify or preserve it.

---

> The press is (theoretically) the free press.

Oh, this one is easy. The Police have bought their own hype, embraced their own Chickenmacho bullshit that they're a Thin Blue Line between society and disorder, and that they're *right* in what they do, that it's *right* that they should throughly abuse Black People, be able to shoot and kill dogs and people because they were *scared*. They don't think they're being Brutal, they think they're being *Necessary.*

(Sidenote: Police do not have a right to ""go home at the end of the Day."" They wield the Coercive power of the State. To wield that Power Selfishly is fundamentally to abuse it.)

They're also mostly Conservative, and I mean Whole-Hog Hierarchy. So when Trump says that the Press is the Enemy, they agree. When they see the Press reporting on their actions, they see an enemy. And they're more than happy to fight the enemy.

And why are they necessary? Why are the Police *justified?* Well, because the Police are one of those mechanicisms by which The Hierarchy was and is enforced. More than anyone else, they need the Hierarchy, because they both create and serve it."
"That’s how the team sports nature of politics goes. If the blue team says something is good, the red team will say it’s bad.

"Where's the wannabe part? Republicans have showed that there will be no consequences for his actions, so Trump keeps doing worse things more blatantly."
When does the wannabe descriptor get dropped? What's the line?

Not that they should use them at all."
"I don't have proof but I know I've gotten emails from some military and police family and they do seem more willing to forward junk propaganda. But I blocked most of that so I haven't seen it in some time, but I remember some of the things that came out near the end of Obama's second term were pretty mean."
"> police are being sent propaganda to their email, and probably other sources, in order to influence their feelings about issues

What do you do when you get an email from someone you don't recognize?"
"Your mom is getting spam, just like everyone else. Me, I delete it without looking at it."
"Agreed. What they did to Sanders, what they did with their responsibility to maintain a good police service in Minneapolis - we need to do something about them. Vote."
Very well said.
Lol... saw more than one journalist from national syndicates on live stream in Minneapolis with a beefy security detail.
"Not disagreeing a bit, but step 1 in the plan to kill the influence of media was to buy up the companies and starve out as much real independent thought as possible. Fox we know was a planned arm of conservative control. Sinclair Group is scripting local TV news. But the more insidious damage IMHO was that their pandering to and reinforcement of badly biased blue collar divisiveness was so popular for so long that other more neutral sources got dragged into the swamp with them in order to compete. But I digress.  
  
There isn't money in real journalism like their used to be. Paying for body guards is perhaps not feasible. I hope I'm wrong."
"> Wait until it gets hot.

Shit was literally on fire at the beginning of the protests and police have been assaulting peaceful protestors for weeks now. If that's not hot, what is? What horrifying shit have you seen?"
"Because the rioters assaulted the press, that's somehow trump's fault ?"
"Dude shut the fuckup. Journalists are out there making a difference, risking getting covid, getting pepper sprayed, arrested, losing fuckin eyes, and your cheeto fingered do-fuck-all ass is telling them to step it up?

Why dont you step it up and either do something about it? Otherwise just let the professionals do their job and keep your nacho-cheese encrusted lips shut on the bench."
Anger is what got them to enroll
"Then you, then me."
"Hell they are trying to do it all at once. The current admin is pretty much just what would happen if you try and let a dysfunctional, non-charismatic dumbass try to play Hitler. It is kind of endearing to see and also pretty sad that around 30% of American voters are weak enough to believe in someone that has historically failed at anything he attempted that he couldn't purchase."

"Watchdog says the arrests and attacks are on a scale they haven't seen before and a lot of these journalist have experience reporting from conflict zones where they were never subject to these types of attacks. So yes, it is not normal and they are not simply being caught up in ""crowd control tactics"" (read ""police rioting""). They are being targeted because They are journalists reporting on the protests and the subsequent barrages of indiscriminate police brutality."
"an iPhone may not, but they're attacking people with camera crews.

I'm pretty sure it's clear that they are press with a group of people, one with a mic and one with a camera recording them talk."
Anyone with an iPhone is press if they publish the photos on Twitter or a blog. Here in the US the 1st Amendment protects that
"Well I guess those people specifically deserved to be attacked, then!"
Fascist bootlicker.
"Yeah, peaceful assembly is so scary"
"if you read the article, it gives numbers for the attacks. out of the 180 assaults, 149 of them were the police. id wager a portion of the other 31 assaults were protest infiltrators (alt-righters, proud boys, etc.)."
"Part of our rights is that you should be able to scream whatever you want at cop or politician or business leader. Unless you are threatening violence, anything you say is protected. Once police start beating and arresting people for insulting them, that is a violation of fundamental rights and a slippery slope to oppression."
Not cherry-picking at all
You wouldnt even get half the information about whats happening right now without them.
It doesn’t matter if the media is biased or not. Police should not be engaging in violence on journalists. And the fact that you’re saying they are doing so because the media has picked a side makes the use of force even less legitimate because you’re admitting it has nothing to do with enforcing the law and everything to do with political violence.
"Well, that obviously isn't true as Tucker and Hannity have not been attacked but news crews from all around the world have."
"No... no it shouldn't.

This is the EXACT point of the entire protests.

Even if Floyd was a horrible person. Even if he was a rapist, a murderer, even if he was a serial killer. He was handcuffed and in custody. At that point, the officer has no justification for being on his neck.

Even if you believe that the media is biased, and raising a flag, the police *still have to uphold the law*. 

You are suggesting the law to be malleable and that justice is just a means for you to eliminate anyone you don't agree with through force rather than legal means."
How does this justify assaulting journalists?
No they don't.  No we haven't.
"Very few do the things you accuse them of. These networks have to compete with each other for viewers. Doing the things you suggested would be an easy way to lose viewers and an easy thing to call out. They may demonstrate bias or sensationalize but they don't all lie cheat and fabricate. 

Fox News on the other hand does not have to compete. They are the biggest network in the U.S. bringing in more viewers than CNN and MSNBC combined. Fox is the definition of MSM. They have a monopoly on ""conservative news"", a term and idea that really didn't exist before them. Fox is everything you described and they have been caught doing those things countless times. 

Getting your news from only one source is the easiest way to allow yourself to propagandized and that's exactly what the vast majority of conservatives do."
"the people that work at OANN are not what anyone calls journalist, dear."
"So before the action of lying etc, you are suggesting that the journalists deserve it because of some perceived wrongdoing that they are about to do?

Didn't know we had reached the point of pre-crime."
No... people on the Left don't view journalists as a problem.
Only the people who enjoy having an authoritarian society where those in power get to decide who lives and who dies with no accountability or repercussions.  Is that you?

"I think you are correct about the purpose, but they are being stupid.

Almost every American has a portable video camera in their pocket. Mine takes better video than news cameras did 20 years ago.  The police won't stop people filming their every action, and that video will keep going out to the community, and the world.

Even if they prevented journalists from major networks reporting from the scene, those networks would still show video of criminal activity by thugs on the so called ""police force.""  Heck, they would probably be more likely to. If someone beat up one of your friends at work, you would be mad about it. I imagine the reporters and anchors will feel the same.

But if you look at other places where jack booted thugs have tried to suppress protests and freedom, you still see the press until you reach China levels of societal control.  The press won't stop, they will just be part of the story while they report crime after crime by people claiming to prevent crime."

"They’re not more “conservative”, they’re more Republican.  Equating conservative political theory with Republican is not accurate anymore.  It’s cult focused on social power and control.  Police on average are more republican meaning they predominantly (if not exclusively) get their information regarding world events from Fox News and talk radio, and probably Facebook."
"True, but at the same time media should be accountable for their reporting. There's plenty of bias in the media overall, and it's easy for people to just find the media that supports what they already think. It's profitable, but divisive. But that runs into free speech issues and enforcement. It's a huge problem that's damn near impossible to solve."

I always like to point out to that it's really even more insidious. People always forget that that the core components of the ACA were Republican plank until 2008.

And even if they aren't, their lack of activity doesn't change the truth that journalists do in fact need to hold power accountable. It's literally their job. Whether your politics lie to the left, right, or center I do believe it's clear that the media has degraded horribly over the last fifty years.

If you really wanted to inspire this commenter to step up their efforts, you would have noticed the Ohio flair next to their name and offered them a few links to local groups that are working towards change in their state. Instead, you merely wanted to insult and degrade another person. That's the least helpful thing you could be doing."

No that is the type of government the press wants to institute. They do not want us free they want chaos so they can rake in those dollar bills. Their reporting is not met for honesty and information but for division
How are riot police in cities controlled by Democrat mayors for decades equivalent to 'far right groups'?
"“The uptick in claims comes as reporters cover the protests against police brutality that have sprung up across the country in response to the murder of George Floyd on May 25.”

Where does it say far right groups are attacking the press?"

"It’s all Antifa.

They’ve been planting sleeper agents in every police precinct and paying them to systemically oppress black people throughout the years and recently instructed them to beat up reporters during riots."
"If you honestly believe that the police would behave differently under a democratic government, then you're also out of touch. You can either have the police doing their thing and beating up people or you can let people protest and burn shit. The only things that would stop the police from doing that shit are accountability and education. These things haven't really changed under any government from what I see."
"Our citizens were attacked out of nowhere by Erdogan's bodyguards when he visited Trump, Trump apologized to Erdogan."
"Not to short sell what happened to Khashoggi, but it happened in a ""land far away"" and he was Saudi Arabian. Out of sight, out of mind.

The fall out if it happens *here* to an American for everyone to see live on camera is likely to be a different beast. Especially at the hands of the police, or worse the military."
But think about all the oil. Who needs the press when you have oil?
Why would he?
What was he supposed to do to a foreign country? You want another war?
"Just keep in mind when you run off to fight eachother: THEY wanted you to go fight eachother and die.  The way we all win is by only killing the heads of the snakes, our ""leaders"".  Killing eachother is literally what they want you all doing. So dont play the game, kill the makers of the game and create a new one."
You’re saying the public won’t be mad about a journalist killed if they were black? Have you seen what the protests are about? It’s not called “apathy about black lives”
">>>”...you still see the press until you reach China levels of societal control”

Um, perhaps that is the end goal, to oppress until we are actually forced to stop, no matter how much oppression it takes."
"Oh, no doubt - thinking that you can remove all documentation of an event in a world where it's extremely plausible that every single person around you is carrying a high definition video camera (many of which stream the video directly to the internet in real time) is ignorant as fuck.  Beating the shit out of peaceful protesters in order to make a protest movement go away is also ignorant as fuck, though, and that hasn't been stopping anyone.

The good news in that we'll have documentation when Trump inevitably gives the order to clear the protest area with lethal force, just like we did when it was non-lethal force.  The bad news is that they'll still murder the shit out of us."
"This is what I've been thinking as well.  I think that this finally gives networks a ""pass"" to be thorough and brutally fair in their investigations of police misconduct.  The modern news machine has gotten in this bad habit the past 20+ years where they feel it necessary to both-sides every story even when it's overwhelmingly obvious that one side is completely wrong.  It's a horrible disservice to the populace.  But with this the police have shown they don't care what the media says.  I think it's a free pass to be completely honest about their brutality, underhandedness, covering for each other and corruption."
What do you think the cops are shooting journalists for?
"Kind of? Like I know the cops are beating the shit out of a lot of people, but I didn't know once they're done they just go ""okay, run along now."""
If those cops could read they'd be very upset!
">>>”There's Nazis among the cops and then there's nazi sympathisers which protects them.”

I’ve been saying this for a year or more, and my friends have been dismissive. Hopefully now everyone sees that Nazism has infiltrated our police and government. Wake up America!"
That’s what’s happening now. Silence is approval. We all gotta speak out when we see this shit. Check the fools until they keep quiet and hide their racism and bullshit deep within their homes again.
"For legal cover, they can use the same language they use when reporting any accused citizen. (""allegedly"", etc.) Instead, they use a passive tone to downplay police actions while doing the opposite for everyone else.

When a cop shoots at someone multiple times, you get ""The officer discharged his weapon.""  If another person does the same thing, you get ""The suspect sprayed gunfire."""
But they call people “alleged killer” and “accused rapist” all the time. I get your point but it’s more complicated than journalists just using the correct terminology. When it deals with police they use the kid gloves to describe the situation.
"They should take out an insurance policy ffs. 

At this point if a newspaper started reporting from a perspective of “all cop shootings are murder until justified in a court of law,” theyd probably be able to go a year before your insurance is needed."
Fitting typo

I'm not a fascist!  I'm anti-anti-fascist.  Checkmate Libtarts.
"Yes. Yes. Yes, it does. See, reality has match manufactured GOP reality, or it is not reality, but the deep state perpetuating a media hoax."

"stochastic terrorism [stuh-kas-tik ter-uh-riz-uh m] -noun- the public demonization of a person or group resulting in the incitement of a violent act, which is statistically probable but whose specifics cannot be predicted: The lone-wolf attack was apparently influenced by the rhetoric of stochastic terrorism."
Conservative ideology in America has been pretty fucking bullshit since it's inception tbh.
"Can you explain what you think the difference between conservatism and current Republican ideology is? 

IMO, Republicans are behaving in accordance with the definition of conservatism given by political scientist Corey Robin in his book, [*The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-reactionary-mind-9780190692001):

>	For that is what conservatism is: a meditation on—and theoretical rendition of—the felt experience of having power, seeing it threatened, and trying to win it back.


>	To the conservative, power in repose is power in decline. The “mere husbanding of already existing resources,” wrote Joseph Schumpeter about industrial dynasties, “no matter how painstaking, is always characteristic of a declining position.” If power is to achieve the distinction the conservative associates with it, it must be exercised. And there is no better way to exercise power than to defend it against an enemy from below. Counterrevolution, in other words, is one of the ways in which the conservative makes feudalism seem fresh and medievalism modern."
"What, exactly, does ""conservative political theory"" mean to you? And how are Republicans failing to execute on it? Do you have any examples of times when the Republican party successfully executed your vision of conservative political theory?

Because from my perspective it seems like the only throughline policy that's common to conservative politics is a sort of hierarchy-building anti-equality, and Republicans are doing *great* at that."
Being a conservative in America means being a white supremacist due to the system they are consciously fighting for
"This sharp division between media sources is what's driving the social divide and hatred in the US, even more than politicians. People are living in different realities from each other, depending on where they get their news.

You can have different opinions and still work together, but you can't if you have different *facts*."
So how about outlining some example of where a reputable media organization got the facts wrong and didn't make a statement correcting it?
Like how FOX was caught photoshoping picture of the CHAZ?
"This is the truth.  It's easy to see the problem, but not easy to see a solution to it. If we decide to hold them accountable, who does that and what are *their* biases? It's a potential minefield."
"I'm sorry, I guess I needed to add a disclaimer that I wasn't implying the media is perfect. I assumed that went without saying. My point was it's unfairly demonized and people are literally getting hurt because of it. CNN has problems. My point doesn't change."
Not even remotely to this degree.
What?

"If he can pull that off. 

Trump can't make states with blue governor's or Democratic majorities cancel their elections without rolling in with the military. The military have voiced their apprehension about doing this to protesters already."
"The 20th amendment to the Constitution guarantees he won't be president after noon on January 20, 2021, unless he wins the election outright. If he wins again by Electoral College fuckery, I think things will get really ugly."
"This is the lowest bar. There's plenty of dictators who hold elections (see competitive authoritarianism). Why give him so much free space to be authoritarian but called ""wannabe""? Besides, voter suppression makes it impossible for every person to vote, even if they all turn out and wait in line."
Won't the speaker of the house assume the role of the president if no elections were held? So there is no chance of him making it a nepotistic dictatorship.
If you guys really want to know why the youth don't vote look at the popular vote last time around. My friends and I recently discovered how the electoral college actually works. It quite literally shows our votes don't matter.

Weird how the racist bootlickers have no evidence of protesters being violent, but we have tons of videos of cops assaulting journalists and children, burning down buildings, and smashing windows"
"They’re fighting the people protesting George Floyd’s death and police brutality 

I’m sorry, but the right doesn’t always seem keen on doing that sort of thing."
"Something along the lines of labeling the press the ""enemy of the people"" and instructions to dominate the streets."
Good thing there ain’t anyone in a seat of power constantly calling the media the enemy. That might confuse the police! Thank god.

You really think Trump controls local police departments?
"The way police have acted with impunity for decades, I don’t think it’s unlikely. Although Trump has certainly emboldened them through his rhetoric."
"“I believe that I could have served the American people admirably as president, but at the end of the day, my throbbing, glistening eggs come first,” a visibly emotional Cruz said at a press conference in St. Louis this morning. “I need to keep my eggs wet with Sprite soda, and that’s incredibly time-consuming. I cannot in good conscience continue my bid for the presidency when I know that twice every hour I need to go into my garage, where my thousands of throbbing eggs shimmer in the dim headlights of the minivan I keep idling at all times, and I need to moisten them with Sprite soda from a spray bottle. My eggs have got to be wet with Sprite soda. I’m sorry.”"
"That feels like it happened so long ago that it was in a different lifetime.

Still angry about it and even the American police that was there did nothing."
And we live in a time and place where so much shit has happened that most people reading had probably forgotten about that.
Khashoggi was a US resident with his children being American citizens. He went to university in the US. A journalist for the Washington Post. You are short selling what happened just like Trump did.
I don’t think the military is part of the problem.
The dictator of Turkey had Americans beat on live TV in the capital under his direct order and Trump thanked him for his visit.
"Not only far away (for some), he was from an aristocratic family and the transgressions of the Saudi regime (who murdered him on Turkish soil) are not that much worse than some western countries has been found guilty of (murder, torture, imprisonment without trial). And having the deed on camera does help communicate those transgressions to people who generally don’t read their news."
"Dont forget Erdogans people assaulted american protesters in the US, and Trump apologised to Erdogan for it.

Its not on the same level as the brutal murder of Kashoggi of course, but it shows the extremely weak leadership of Donald Trump, the man who is supposedly a good president because he is a tough guy."
"Sanctions, that is literally what sanctions are for."
Stop selling them weapons?
No we need a real revolution.  The people need to take the country back.  Not kill each other.
"For context this person is referring to the 1% and lifelong politicians that aren't speaking out against, and actually making tangible change to this situation."
"Well, when you arrest someone you need to charge them with something. While cops can and do make up bullshit charges, those can be challenged and can open the police up to liability if false. 

They can usually beat the shit out of whoever they like without repercussions. I think that’s where the discrepancy lies."
Yeah but when they accuse citizens those aren't the rich and powerful citizens so they have no fear of lawsuits. In those cases they only have to protect against indefensible libel.
"That's hilariously untrue. The reason why reporters use passive voice is because they're reporting second hand based on (typically) the police reports. A reporter would be reprimanded for writing ""the suspect sprayed gunfire,"" too as that's a direct assertion that implies the journalist personally witnessing the event - a big no no."
Thank you so much for posting the definition.  I've been learning so much new stuff over the last weeks because of redditors like yourself
"Conservative idealogy was literally a system designed for monarchs and rulers to retain power when monarchy transitioned to other forms of government. It's the political spectrum of power, control, and constantly trying to figure out who's better than who.

Of course it's fucking bullshit. It's not an ideology designed in any way to boost the working labourer in any way.

Yet dipshits keep supporting it. Some people like to be ruled."
"You don't have to get facts wrong to show a biased account. Let's take a fictional example of groups A and B getting in a fight. Let's say there's video of someone from A throwing something into a crowd of B, turning to walk away, and getting punched by someone from B.

Now, one outlet will show the first part and report that group B were attacked by group A while holding a peaceful gathering. They will show some injured people from B and report the total injuries. They will say group A is trying to suppress group B. Technically true.

Another outlet will show the second part of the video. They will report the group B gathering erupted in violence. Group A member was sucker punched to the ground as violent B members were yelling obscenities. Also technically true.

So, who's in the right? Who's in the wrong? Would your opinion be influenced one way or another by either of those reports, would you find one of them more convincing based on your prior beliefs about groups A and B? Are either of them factually wrong enough to be corrected by the outlet?"
"Yes, like that. But the problem with heavily biased reporting goes deeper than that. News is a business, so the incentive is to air what sells, not what's accurate."
">  I wasn't implying the media is perfect

I know. You were implying CNN is a neutral arbiter of truth."

[deleted]
This can’t be overstated.
"True, bit there may be enough states with either red governor's or legislative majorities to cancel elections and sent Biden an EC victory."
He'll just continue to make it harder and harder for minorities and leftists to vote. Like conservatives have been doing and have been getting away with.
Like he gives a shit about the Constitution
The constitution also says he's not allowed to accept money from foreign or domestic enterprises yet here we are.
"He WILL win again by EC. Then he will be assassinated. Then pence takes over and continues the fall of america.  Cant bring in a new world government if the current govs are working properly and the sheep are happy.  Gotta create as much discord and chaos as possible to make the sheep welcome ANY form of ""safety"""
"And yet, by taking that mindset, you fall into exactly the kind of complacency that Trump wants you to have.

If forward-thinking, politically-minded young people refuse to vote, because their chosen candidate will never win, then their chosen candidate will *never* win."
They matter locally. Which is the only politics that matters in the grand scheme of things.
"Okay, I'm going to sound old, but for a generation that meticulously plans out raids or their equivalent in whatever MMO is the rage these days, you guys sure don't seem to care about things that actually *matter*.

You have to look at this strategically, or at least tactically. Even if it ""doesn't count"" it sends a message. And I'm pretty sure the EC doesn't apply to local offices, which honestly have a **much** larger impact on your day to day life.

Yeah, my county always goes red. Always. But I'm still voting, and I'm voting for Bernie, to send a message, and it won't detract from Biden. I'm also voting for local offices."
"If it didn't count, Obama wouldn't have been president. It counts, it just counts less, which means even more of a reason you all need to get off your lazy asses and fucking vote. We have a god damn fascist as president. If anytime is the time to care, it's now."
"The journalists are far worse than rioters, looters, protesters and police combined"
"I can only speak for what I’ve seen personally, which has been both sides. I’ll agree with you that most of the anger has been from the right. Honestly they both have pretty good reasons to be upset with at least the big outlets like FOX and CNN"
"Mate, you can't brush off all criticisms of civil unrest and assault as 'racism'. It's not racist to not want your business burnt to the ground, and to not want to be assaulted just for having a camera out in public.

"Maybe...I think the point is that an internal direction coming from the president, filtered down via various sympathetic followers, got sent out to police. It isn’t as far fetched as you may think. In Occupy Wall Street protests, the FBI held coordination meetings between police and civilian government of multiple cities to coordinate a response(suppression) to those protests. 

Now think of someone like trump who hates the press if they aren’t actively blowing him 24/7 being in charge of a system like that."
"I don’t like Trump either, but the media and the police shouldn’t be your friends."
No one flinches as we all float face down...
I just woke up it breakfast time for me.
"He's not short selling it at all, he's just explaining why it wasn't a big deal to many americans. Out of sight, out of mind is a real thing."
The unfortunate fact of the matter is that he had the wrong name/skin color/ethnicity/religion for most Americans to give a shit.
Ethnicity still plays a part in nationality for many minds.
They have actual rules of engagement.
"I think they also like to keep the police friendly to them, since they rely on them for information so much."
"You are hilariously wrong. They alternate between a passive tone and sensationalistic tone all the time, regardless of whether they personally witnessed the event."
"Oh I agree, it's literally about keeping un-democratic hierarchies in place. But sometimes I shy away from opinions that are that strong"

Imagine you grab onto a tree branch and feel this fucker tickling your hand. Nope.
So sad that the fear of spiders is preventing people from appreciating this little fellas capability of becoming a gift wrapper of some sorts.
"Yikes, the comments on this post... This spider (genus *Dolophones*) is found in Australia, where you're not likely to make a habit of grabbing random tree branches in the first place. Their venom is no more dangerous to humans than that of ~~a common~~ an American house spider.

EDIT: Australian house spiders are in fact *more* venomous than the wrap around spider."
How does an exoskeleton bend?
Nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope...
Now I get why they're burning the Amazon
So where do I need to not go
Oh! I saw this on Harry Potter. It was wrapped around a book.
That's dope
Next your gonna tell me there is a spider that flys
Jah
Imagine climbing a tree and releasing your inner child when you grab this branch... I will go fetal position and shout until I hear the police.
Let me guess... Australia?
I now support deforestation
Damn its beautiful and all these ass hats are praising the amazon fire because it exists I get they're joking but holy fuck lighten up it's one of mother nature's beautiful creatures
r/tihi
Imagine if it though your arm was a tree branch
Where is it? There's no spider here!!
Imagine these around a toilet paper roll in a stall.
r/SneakyAnimals
“Get god on the phone”
Just imagine grabbing that branch and then all its legs sprawl out and start wiggling as it struggles to escape
Didn't work now did it?
I wonder how many times I'm gonna see this photo again in my lifetime? I think the first time I seen this was 4 or 6 years ago. lol.
You mentioned something flattening itself from the wrapping around the arm of your couch like that. You just sit there one day mind your own business. Wondering what that weird looking stain is about 8 inches from your arm. And then you look a little bit closer at it. And realize if it is regular and it's irregularity. And a little raised. And a little bit fuzzy... And did it just... FLINCH??
"Now imagine you’re out hiking, you lose your balance and you grab that exact branch on that exact spot to balance yourself.."
So where's the spider?
No
Well don’t think alligators live around zebras
I was wondering how it looked normally; [there’s a picture on Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolophones_conifera).
ight i’ma head out
Is there a video of this kinda interesting
We all just imagined grabbing that beach without knowing he was there....dying inside
>	Can you imagine if everyone around you
man animals like this are just asking to be accidentally grabbed or stepped on
As if I needed another reason to fear spiders
Hi Australia! (I'm assuming)
I wish I could wear one like a slap bracelet.
"You're probz right, but I can’t fly."
Please go back and remove this from my memory.

I love it. My stuff doesn’t look like trees so it will stay over there (and eat bugs) where it’s special camo works. Very polite spider
Now imagine it wrapping your finger/hand and flattening aroud it. Nope nope.
That's what I thought when I seen it. Thanks buddy.
unless it wont die. so its bigger nope for him.

"Imagine pulling out your wallet and sliding out a credit card... nope, it's a spider sleeping in your billfold."
Only in Australia... *thankfully.*
"Yeah, so much senseless hate. The boys are good at hiding, that's adorable!"
See but that’s the problem with a phobia. You can’t really do a ton about that involuntary shivery feeling or imagining grabbing it on accident.
"To add a bit to that -- the genus *Dolophones* belongs to the orb weavers (Araneidae), all of which are harmless to humans. Not only is their venom harmless, they are also reluctant to bite (as are most spiders, anyway). This spider lives in a web at night, and retreats to her camouflaged spot during the daytime. She's also quite small, less than 1 cm."
Yeah man I point out that their views are unfounded and antagonistic and they just keep being belligerent half wits
It doesn't. The way they bend at joints allows the wrap around.
To kills spiders in Australia?
Australia. Always Australia.
"So pet every branch, then these things won't bite me. Got it."
Yep
"Yes thank you! It’s the same tired old shitty arachnophobic jokes for every single spider pic, no matter how amazing or beautiful the spider is."
Oh and I just found out its Australian so only only will the numbnuts who are butthurt over spiders existing never ever have to interact with the few who do will be or should be pretty damm educated and respectful unlike the jerk off who thinks I won't make him look like forest burner
No

"Oh yeah, but it's the roof of your mouth. Somehow he is always so quick to bite your tongue."
I know I'm thankful to have them. They're awesome!
"Nice. I meant American house spider, but the fact that Australian ones are even more venomous is a great point."
Wtf Australia? This is starting to feel like a abused spouse type thing. Its OK to leave now. Fucking everything there is trying to kill you.
i feel you may underestimate Aussies.
"Sure, but joking about burning down a forest to kill all spiders is very much voluntary."
Well that’s kind of the point of a phobia; they are irrational.
Cool! TIL
Yes.
You have to stroke the spine
"Many people on r/natureismetal just love to talk about how spiteful and dangerous animals are, and hate hearing about nuance and, y'know, biology."
Kys spiders are fundamental to the continuation of the planet and cool ones are consistently destroyed by half breed inbred fucktard cock suckers like you
"He smells crime, back to the lab, full penetration, crime, penetration, crime, full penetration..."
Ewwww
Bruh.
Like those snap on bracelets!
"It’s not too bad here, they mostly cancel each other out, if there’s a big spider then a bird will eat it. If that bird is bothering you a snake will eat it. If the snake is bothering you then a wedge tailed eagle will eat it. It’s manageable"
Yeah fair
I don't want to turn on all the trees in the forest.
"I'm pretty sure the guy you are responding to was just meaning to say that if you understand that they were all joking, then there is no reason that you should be getting all bent out of shape over the content of the joke."
No dealing with the same joke is irritating and especially on something that some of us are passionate about the joke is tired and played out and more outright positive attempts at interaction should be tried I'm outright terrified of some bugs but I dont go out of my way to hate on them infact I think those ones are pretty dope
Yeah but fuck if t they could just appreciate some shot instead of every time just scream kill ot with fir I may not have commented on it at all however few people were showing any positive views towards this majestic creature

"Upvote this comment if this is a proper ""You seeing this shit?"" reaction.  Downvote this comment if this is not fit for this subreddit."
I dunno why but this seems like a set up on the girl.
The best part is when she tried to grab it.
his dick may be green but those balls? blue...
It’s awesome how she handled it so smooth. Even though it was obviously a prank she was as cool as a cucumber.
How grateful is he that his face is covered for this.

At least she was nice about it

She really really wanted to touch it. Everyone get out
"You know, depending on how you look at it, her touching him is both making it better and worse."
Definitely a prank

She was such a good sport about it

They were pranking her but I think he started getting a real one when she touched him.
"Maybe stop touching the guy with the erection?

Take away that it’s a prank.  Take away that she’s hot.  As far as she knows they are both professionals and she all but grabs his dick and keeps touching his leg and shoulders."

How is he gonna face his colleagues in the future lol. They probably gonna tease him every now and then.

Plot twist this was just a prank!
So he was thinking of someone other than her then?

One of the advantages. I have as a small penis is that I can totally have erection in public and nobody will notice it

This would be sexual harassment case in the near future. No more fun and jokes allowed.
Also where is this from?
She straight up went in for the dangle wrangle with no hesitation. Hope he got her digits.
She couldn’t stop staring at it
This is making cringe so hard that guy must be so embarrassed
he should've owned it
Lmao that's fucking hilarious
Why would the other guy take his concealment away hahahha
whats her name
"I can only assume she thought it was fake and wanted to grab it, but then realized it would be a huge mistake if it was real.

Or... natural insticnt kicked in from her other job."
Obviously fake. That thing is abnormally huge.
"Poor guy, lol"
"""Let me go fix this"", readjustment or taking care of it?"
u/redditdownloader
"sooo we just ignore 2 years of #metoo. So if its a hot woman she can just grab? I get the guy has an erection, but its not like men can control it. At least he was not trying to assualt her with it. I guess if its a hot guy and the woman is showing ""serious intrest"" he can just grab her by the pussy?"
Sauce?
"Is it just me or did she seem surprisingly into it? Also, yeah I wanted her to grab it."
"To be fair, he pushed on like an absolute professional"
You think he would have jizzed as soon as she touched his leg
Dude owned that blue vein throbber
All these comments and nobody has posted the name of this girl?!?!??
Another staged bull shit internet point grab.
Move to a different country
"I remember time when women could understand those thing.
Now, they’ll probably call it harassment"
Oh I’m seeing this shit
u/VredditDownloader
u/redditdownloader
"I feel like she really shouldn’t have grabbed it. I mean, he couldn’t controll having a boner(though I think he should have noticed), and IMO at no point did it become okay for her to grab him like that."
"Boners Happen:
https://youtu.be/NOR5ivnfSxs"
"Alright, after seeing this we know we can make live action with CGI porn"
She laughed his boner away. So cruel.
I have no respect for them if it was a prank. She is doing her job and you are putting an erect dick in her face. Then we ask women not to say me too. This is sexual harassment if it's a prank.
My dude has got a pencil dick
"Yeah, but if it was a woman as the grip and a dude grabbed her nipple, people would be in uproar over assault."
It is. Saw this video months ago. It was a prank on the supermodel.
"It is, as the owner of a penis, I can confirm that it wouldn't point out the way it does in the video, it would either be pressed flat against his abdomen, or it would point straight out but it would be slightly lower. 

This is 100% fake."
"Of course, that's why they asked her to look right past his dick."
Until someone posted the video I assumed it was a Tosh.O prank. Seems like something he’d do.
"The background music alone had me going ""this was on MTV wasn't it?  Is this Punk'd?"""
"It was a prank video yeah, they created some weid ‘erection machine’ they activated during. Pretty harmless fun"
"It is, thats not what it would look like *at all*"
I kinda low key wanted her to
I thought this was a porno for a second
Great thought material for the green guy.
"Pretty sure she more than just ""tried"" under that light reflector"
It was a reflex
Thought this was leading up to that

Wow good on op for highlighting the only entertaining part. Rest of it was cringe and so try hard.
"Thank you good sir,"
Its like thousands of people just screamed out of embarrassment and were suddenly silenced.
It’s a prank
Even almost grabbed it for the dude
Why wouldn’t she be?  It’s a huge compliment.  Well it’s a compliment.
Well she looked at it at eye level
You could tell instinct almost took over what with the boner and the cameras.
Legit sexual harassment
Yes but hot woman in a bikini.
Lacy summers I believe
She’s pretty
Are you the one in the video? You should have asked her
"If this were real.. how would you hide it, other than just walking off the set. Spandex leaves little to the imagination. No matter how you position yourself, it'll still be on full display."
"What we got there is a ""stuck partial."""
It's normal? Your ligament that makes your dick stick out is different. In clothes it doesn't only because the clothing stops it.

“Supermodel”
Supermodel is very generous
She went straight for grabbing at that thing too
"We have such different interpretation of the word supermodel. If there's plastic and an overuse of injections, it's not super."
This video is as old as my grandma.
My thoughts as well. Unless your dick started out sucked up inside you and grew straight out like pinocchios nose... but even then it probably wouldn't be that perfectly straight outward.
"Your dick might do that. Don't speak for my wiener, and the copious amounts of duct tape I use to straighten it out."
"as another penis owner, can you imagine the pain of a middle school bus ride if boners *couldn't* be folded flat? God I don't miss my youth at *all*."
"Boners are like lightning, they’ll follow the path of least resistance as they travel, usually down the left or right pants leg."
My weiner hangs to the left.
I could imagine it's possible in spandex
Man had his wanger on his bellybutton
Only way mine does this is if I stick it straight forward and then adjust my pants to keep it there. So it's a setup regardless if the boner is real or not. Normal bone just follows the boxer/pant leg of the side it's currently residing in.
Haha this guy is a cock expert
"Assuming it’s not fake, None of the setup makes sense. WTF is he even doing there? Having produced films that contain heavy use of green screen, it’s unlikely any DP is going to have handheld bounce fill because as soon as you catch reflection from the floor, you’ve got green spill that’s a pain to deal with in post. Even if the DP thinks they should use handheld bounce, the producer should be shutting him down for wasting budget. If an issue comes up and you need a stationary bounce, you’re going to put that on a C-stand instead of taking the risk, and it would be ridiculous to pay someone to do the job of s C-stand. 

Then there’s multiple angles. Why are they shooting from an angle with crew and equipment visible? 
Plus, that’s the worst lit green screen ever.  Anyone who set it up with that heavy shadow being cast across it should be fired immediately. And why are they so close to the damn screen? There’s clear green spill all over her. If it was real, everyone should be fired. Or, it’s fake."
I've been a number of dicks in my life and every one of them is different. Some point down. Or up. To the left or the right. It's definitely possible.
"My dick points pretty much straight out like that /shrug

"It appears that she was aware that she was obviously being pranked. So in reality, it’s kind of gross that people played such an aggressively sexual prank on her. She handled it so well because it seems like she actually was used to that situation happening to her, which is pretty depressing."

"My wife says if it was genuinely unintentional and they’re not being rude about it, it’s a compliment."
"It can be taken as a genuine, although accidentally rude one, sadly we cant control when in happens (or, in most cases, when it doesn't, it would be so god damn useful, way less discomfort)"
Worked for Louis CK... oh wait.
"When they walk around the office in bikinis I will. 

It’s an involuntary physiological response. 

It’s still a compliment even if you don’t take it as such."
"I believe it's a compliment because an erection (although it can happen randomly some times) most likely shows affection towards someone or something. And in some cases, girls will probably understand that if a guy gets and erection while hanging out or talking with her that it's a mere accident while also showing interest. And showing interest in a girl, especially if she knows you are showing interest, can sometimes lead to her taking it as a compliment. Almost like  saying ""is that a _____ in your pocket or are you just happy to see me."
lol no problem friend
"That green gentleman, weren’t you the one in the clip?? I figured you of all people would know her name"

"Definitely a prank. But what if the boner popped while he was standing there holding the thing? She's already right there. Not like he could just go ""scuse me"" and turn around real quick to position it pointing to his belly button. The damage is already done hahaha"

It's Sokka from Avatar: The Last Airbender. The episode is called Tales of Ba Sing Se
Yep! It’s from an episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender. [Here’s a link to the clip.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K7-2_gUuWK4) I rewatched the series recently and really enjoyed this scene.
I believe it’s all about intention.  If you intend it as a compliment that’s what it is.   If it’s received as an insult then it’s both but the person who’s offended needs to own that’s their reaction and it wasn’t the intention.
"“bUt tHeSe WoMeN nOw” will never *not* be funny. Keep up the solid work, champ."

What does Liberia have to do with this?
"you can do that?  you can hide a boner in your legs? while standing? I cannot put mine *down* at all. AT ALL. Left or up is my skillset. Not right. no no no, and NEVER down."
That's a recipe for disaster. There's nothing worse than a freed goop shooter when you're standing next to the hot girl that was sitting in front of you on the bus.

"Oh, real nice Rahn!"
"This is particularly true because people are far more receptive of compliments from people that they already either respect, or are attracted to. The exact same words from either a stranger, or someone they don’t find physically attractive, will often elicit a completely different reaction."
"I'd say if your compliment could be reasonably construed as threatening, then you need to work on giving compliments. A random boner is quite threatening to a lot of women, particularly if she's in a vulnerable position. The OP seems like it's all in good fun but I wouldn't generally take a random man's boner as a compliment, mainly because of the things random men have done to myself and many of my friends with their boners."

That’s been my theory for a while."
"Look to your elder, people: sitting there *not* grabbing his low key.."
*It's used to it! Wooooo!*
Reasonable by whom?   A perceived threat needs to be voiced.  What happens next determines if it’s an actual threat.   People need to be as responsible for their perceptions as much as we do of our actions.  Nothing is inherently threatening on the face of it.  Intention is most of it.  It’s not easy which is why we need to practice communicating more.
"Not unless it was part of a pattern of behavior.  If you were informed it was taken as an offense and you apologized and didn’t do it again then yes.

Should we work together on this thesis? Who do we present it to? What purpose does it serve? Either way that seems like a rock solid theory. It amazes me.

"Oh sheesh, they didn't go in to edit the faulty gene out. They REACTIVATED the blood's ability to produce fetal haemoglobin instead, which does not suffer from the effects of thalassaemia and sickle cell."
CRISPR will change humanity. Now let’s find out if it will be for the good or for the bad.
I don’t know why CRISPR isn’t constantly blowing everyone’s nips off; it’s the most future shit we’ve ever done.
Please smart people cure my shitty APOE e4/e4 alzheimer's genes before I hit 60
Please keep your good news to yourself. This is 2020 buddy
"I have thalassaemia. Not inherited, a freak mutation. When I was a baby I was highly anaemic and in intesive care for weeks and nearly didnt make it. But after being taken home my body adapted to raise the levels of other types of haemoglobin and red blood cells.
I have never had a blood transfusion. There was a study done about me apparently, but I haven't heard anything about it. My mum was told I would never be able to play sports etc because of low oxygen uptake.some 25 years on I'm now an avid mountaineer, cyclist and martial artist."
Can someone in the know please kindly explain why we shouldn't get too excited about this? Thanks.
"Finally, now I can increase my he.... I mean treat my inherited disease."
It's funny how sickle cell disease was a selective advantage facing malaria (some even mild forms protect you from dying of malaria tropica) and now one of the first diseases to be edited out of people.
"Baby steps.
A powerful tool that has to be used in a very fragile situation...great to see actual permanent cures."
Damn wish they did this earlier RIP to my cousin he died of sickle cell
Gene editing will be the future of medicine and more. And it will cost an insane amount of money to have annoying issues like getting old being fixed
Let's wait for potential side effects to show. Hopefully not but we'll need to wait for a long time probably.

"I bought crispr at $19 and sold it at $40 thinking I'd discovered something neat .... Since the pandemic I've since had to sell most all most stock to pay for my bills... First one I'm putting in a bit order for when I'm good to go, crispr"
Can somebody explain how this is administered? Is it lasers? Injection? Pills?
"Oh sheesh, they didn't go in to edit the faulty gene out. They REACTIVATED the blood's ability to produce fetal haemoglobin instead, which does not suffer from the effects of thalassaemia and sickle cell."
I remember a Chinese scientist getting heat for doing something similar.
"I wonder if it will work for my undiagnosable, disease. My face is constantly hot and red, burning hot. I live under and sleep under a fan 24/7. Totally debilitating, it's somewhat improved after I had my kidney removed from surgery, but I'm still debilitated and my life is severely impacted. Will CRISPR work for me?"
That's pretty uplifting considering my mom has thalassemia minor.

"That is very cool, how does the treatment get administered? Like is it one injection or a bunch over a long period of time?"

could you treat gilbert syndrome/morbus meulengracht with CRISPR?

"Gattaca, here we come. 

The sky is limit with CRISPR. They do multiple gene edits now in preclinical papers."
Treated with CRISPR or genetically edited with CRISPR
The NIH has a fantastic research program for your disease. You may want to contact them and see if there are trials you can be a part of.
"You have a messed up intercellular matrix. It's not living cells, and it's already there. We need you to have bone maintenance cells that we can improve, or maybe pump you full of goo. I have to sit down now.

EDIT: I have been to Wikipedia, looks like you need an immunological retroviral treatment that replaces what you maintain your connective tissues with. So if that can develop, once it has, if used on you, you have to wait for those immune cells to replace the others. And then it's going to have complications analogous to Sappers punching each-other over how to do arches. So you have several kinds of waiting ahead of you, each at least a couple of years. Best-case scenario. We need to ""flush out"" the surface layer of the bad matrix volumes, and maybe then install internal re-inforcements. So you need to be brave for quite a while if you ever want to live like a crazy monkey."
"Prolly not, this sort of research is either illegal or barely legal in most of the countries with the capability to use it.  WHO even calls for a blanket ban on all embryo editing which would severely limit research.

Diabetes here! Get in line!

I had a good mate that died from OI a couple years ago. It would be awesome to see some sort of relief or treatment for OI
Not yet Mr Glass.
Can you explain this a bit more?
"But... that’s a good thing, right?"
"PA here. One of the prescriptions used for these blood disorders is hydroxyurea which causes an increase in fetal hemoglobin. Doesn’t prevent the need for blood transfusions, but may spread them out a little more. This basically makes it so your body does all that for you. Very cool"
"It sounds maybe like your responding to comments here, because the headline doesn’t suggest that they “edited the faulty gene out.” It just says they were treated for their diseases using CRISPR"
Seems like a much safer edit to me.
I learned about this in the 80s that it would be the saving factor for people with sickle cell disease if we could just fine a way to reactivate fetal hemoglobin.  They finally did it! This is awesome!
What I'm hearing is that they successfully genetically modified sufficient volumes of in-vivo cells in subjects to cure genetic disorder with 3 instances.
ok new teeth please
"I wonder why! the trial had bone marrow transplantation with cells that had the edited genes to activate HbF, instead of fixing or changing sickle genes. More information is needed. Hopefully they will publish the details of the study soon."
I was gonna say editing the genome of a living person is a great way to start a civil war in the body between the edited and unedited versions of your cells.
I wouldn’t mind having some of my goofed up cells reset.
It’s the upgraded version of CRISPR
"It doesn’t have to be just one or the other, it can be both."
So this can be used on kids and adults as well? Always thought this was to change a fetus'DNA before it's born. That's crazy! Looking forward to further news in the next few years.
"It will certainly be both. The doctors of the world are CRISPRing up changes to fix bad SNPs and single gene dysfunctions, while the less ethical people will be tinkering with, well, everything else. There are probably ""dark"" labs in the world right now CRISPRing human embryos and all myriad cell lines for various experiments ranging from the mundane to the insane.

You remember how computer science changed the world over the past three decades? Buckle up, CRISPR's got the potential to be like that. Hopefully regulation will roll in before all hell breaks loose... but hey, it might be pretty cool to see people with naturally purple hair and eyes, and glow in the dark skin. (You know, until someone accidentally translocates a gene to the exact wrong place and unlocks encephalitis lethargica or some other horrifying indigenous retrovirus that goes on a killing spree...)"
It is the ultimate fruit of the knowledge of good and evil.
"Results are in:  for the good.

Turns out unfounded distrust and fear of science was wrong this time, too.  Always next time, the concept has been popular for millennia."
"It will bring good because good people will fight for it. But nothing is stopping someone to do something bad.

What about therapy that needs ""updates""?  A single edit can't be perfect.  

Who owns the edited genes?  You can't meet quarterly reports anymore with just a cure. Just ask any diabetics."
"It's gonna be for the bad, then after the bad happens, good will be reinstated, but then after a while you get the bad again, and then the good after that and so on and so forth."
"I'm thinking about health insurance costs.  Some people able to afford the treatment, others not and have to pay for other treatments or suffer/die.

It's crazy how pessimistic people are about crispr. Scientists by and large are ethical people trying to make the world better - the pessimism does not seem warranted.
Why not both ?
Let's hope so. I need my cartilage regenerated in my left and right shoulders and hips.
"Imo this experiment is a milestone for mankind, should get more coverage"
"It'll change the wealthy and the powerful, sure."
It’ll change for the rich.
"Like most revolutionary discoveries, the answer is likely both."
It'd be nice if it could cure ankylosing spondylitis within my lifetime so I'm not dependent on immunosuppressants anymore.
Yeah let's maybe put CRISPR away until 2020 is over.
For both? As usual...
"Neither probably. 

I think our ethics board will stop us at some point, right when it is about to takeoff. 

Other countries with relaxed ethics laws will get to it first."
"Why not both? The rich will design their heirs to cement power and further their advantage, but when the tech is cheap enough, chronic illnesses can be cured. I hope this can be made in my lifetime. Failing that, I hope any children I get can benefit from this if they inherit my flaws."
"Because any mistake could have lasting effects on humanity forever. I'm pro transhumanism and I think it's a tool we must use to help patients who need it, but we should be careful and establish protocols to make sure to minimize the effects and the occurence of mistakes, and make sure that they can't be transmitted to future generations."
"It's complicated science, and as the other comment says, the wrong move could have lasting consequences for humanity. It's a very new science as all things go. 

Then there's the fear mongering. Genetic modification, in both plants and animals, has always had a ton of fear mongering around it."
"Once CRISPR can cure blown nips, I'll be right along side you singing its praises, brother."
"Exactly.. Me working for the airlines I move so much medical cargo it's crazy. I see more stem cells being shipped all over, especially stem cells from Embryos."
How old are you now?
"As I understand it, if you cut out the refined carbs and sugar, you actually do better than most people. But that's a big 'if'."
How did you get tested for this?
"Been happening for a long time, CRISPR cured advanced lung cancer in China many years ago.  This CRISPR is a huge upgrade, too, but globally the trust is too low in gene editing for us to move forward."

"Do you know what type of thalassemia? Alpla, beta, delta? The globin chains expressed usually change in the first 6 months of life"
"You probably have beta thalassemia and HPFH, a mutation that results in the imperfect silencing in the gamma globin gene. People that inherit HPFH have ameliorated beta thalassemia."
Damn. Defying the odds.
"Well for one, this technique still requires pretty intense chemotherapy to kill the non-edited cells."
Also CRISPR is known for its off target effects. As in it may change genes that it was not intended to. The full effects of which might not be seen or noticed for some time.
We have other ways of treating malaria and sickle cell disease is a DISEASE for a reason.

i think VRTX was also involved in this; recent paper
Crispr uses viruses
It's an injection of fluid containing billions of copies of a virus that has been engineered to preform the gene editing instructions.
"So he did it to embryos (which makes it permanent and will pass on to their children) to change something that really didn't need changing, simply to see if they could. Apart from the ethical issues, it was highly irresponsible as it may have caused unintended genetic changes which may cause big issues for these babies.

The modified genes that have questionable effect anyway - potentially higher resistance to HIV and other infections.

He knew it was wrong - he faked documents and reports so that he wouldn't be stopped until after it was already done."
What devices could counter something like this.
Probably not.
"It'll probably have to be genetic for CRISPR to work since it edits genes. If your condition is caused by genetics then maybe, but if it's not a common condition I don't think scientists would put many resources into producing them.

What's the distinction? Cas9 protein isn't therapeutic on its own?
what about gilbert syndrome/morbus meulengracht?
"Woah, hang on, we've got people looking into viable connective tissue replacements?  Here I thought that was going to be on the material science side and not the gene editing side but I for one welcome our superior connective overlords.

Oh man.  Theres so much untreatable developmental as well as lifelong injuries that this would blow the doors wide open on. Maybe even increase the success of skin grafts and other transplants by replacing or rebuilding the fascia."
Alternatively they could just use some CRISPr to target the genes of unmodified cells of that particular type.
"Not really. The illegality stems from using CRISPR on germ cells, the cells that create sperm and eggs, as we don't entirely understand how CRISPR can affect the offspring of a patient. In this case, bone marrow was removed and treated, then reimplanted into the patient, ergo no modification of germ cells."
The work described in the article doesn't involve any germline genetic engineering.
"What if the deal was that you can have the treatment if you are willing to sterilize yourself.  If you cannot pass the modified genes, I don’t see an issue with trying a new radical treatment, IF the subject has been properly informed."
"I guarantee you that USA, China, and Russia all have human hybrid experiments growing in labs buried in the side of mountains somewhere"
A dead subject they would harvest all your organs...
"Hemoglobin is a complex molecule consisting of four globin subunits, each containing a heme group, which is what the oxygen binds to. In this case it's the globin portion that we're interested in. Globin can come in a few different forms, particularly the alpha and beta forms that are used in adult hemoglobin (HbA), and the gamma form that replaces the beta subunits in fetal hemoglobin (HbF). In beta thalassemia, production of the beta subunit is reduced or absent, while in sickle cell disease the beta subunit is malformed. By turning on the gene for gamma globin, HbF can be produced to offset the lack of HbA."
"So these people have a gene defect in their DNA where the body makes bad red blood cells.

Genes are basically instructions to make proteins, and these proteins do different things in your body.

Gene defects can do different things - make too much of something, not make or not make enough or something, or make bad or broken things.

Your body creates a few different proteins that combine to make red blood cells, very important things in your body. With sickle cell disease your body makes a bad version of one of these proteins that makes ""sickle"" or weird shaped red blood cells, that are not good at doing their job. So people with this disease need to have blood transfusions to add more ""good"" blood so they can survive.

You would think that the solution is to ""fix"" the bad gene in the DNA using CRISPR, which would allow your body to just start creating new blood. But what they have done instead is activate a gene that creates a different type of red blood cells that your body uses before you are born. They took some bone marrow cells out of each patient - this is what makes the red blood cells - and changed the gene in them using CRISPR. They then used chemotherapy to kill all of the bone marrow in the patients body, and put the CRISPR modified cells back in. The bone marrow grows back from the new edited cells, and the fix is permanent in their body.

It's absolutely incredible stuff. Has the potential to completely cure and eradicate some of the nastiest diseases out there right now today, and has huge potential for many other things."
"Fetal globin is a type of haemoglobin that the body produces when you’re a foetus that has a stronger bond to oxygen so that the baby can “steal” oxygen from the mother. When you are born the body stop producing this kind of haemoglobin and goes to the normal one. Instead of fixing the broken gene for regular haemoglobin (which causes these diseases) you just need to reactivate the fetal globin and the person can live a normal life. (They discovered this because some people who had sickle cell but were perfectly healthy had their fetal globin gene accidentally active due to natural mutations) 
Also apparently if you have your fetal globin gene active and you’re a pregnant woman the baby still grows to be healthy (it can still “steal” the mother’s oxygen even though the mother also has fetal globin)"
"Not op, but nope"
"Yeah, it works. Using medicines to increase fetal Hemoglobin (which you make naturally before birth) is a staple of sickle cell treatment. It doesn’t cure their sickle cell disease but it does prevent the most serious problems."
I was just about to say this. I had sickle beta thalassemia growing up and they had me on hydroxurea from the late 90’s until ‘08. Instead of having a sickle cell crisis every 3 months due to transfusions and blood life cycle they stretched out to a year or so. I ended up having a bone marrow transplant when I was 16 with my sister as a donor and will be cured for 12 years in august.
That's why it's a good idea to read the article. It's pretty short actually.

It will be both.
Just like the internet.
If you think it's for bad then what makes you no different from anti-vaxxers or people who believe in essential oils and are against medicine.
"Okay... Personally I hope we don't regulate this out of existence.

It seems clear that it's possible to apply this to adults. That means people can consent, which removes perhaps the largest ethical question about gene editing.

If I want to edit the shit out of my own genome later in my life to try and see if I can improve those later years (maybe extend them?) Then that should be okay. Why not? Only person going to get hurt is me."
So we can look forward to it being used for nothing but porn and memes in 40 years?
There's probably a bunch of little universal soldier babies in a CRISPR tank just floating around in a lab somewhere
I learned about CRISPER back 4 years ago when they first started learning about this new technology. I immediately knew this could be used the most evil shit.

Yes. It is always wrong to distrust and fear science. Science is for the good. We must praise science. Science never accidentally creates new diseases that kill hundreds of thousands of people while destroying the global economy.
Where is your PHD sir?
"It’s a little early to completely understand the ramifications of editing someone’s DNA. Sure the disease was cured, but have any long-term serious side effects been introduced? I’m talking cancer. Even worse than cancer, serious changes to that persons genetic structures that they will pass to their children. Maybe this one change doesn’t matter, but after there have been hundreds of thousands of changes over the years the sum of all  of those changes have some extreme negative consequences?

No. Somatic genome editing, for example, affects *only* the treated person -- the changes are not hereditary"
"I assure you, as with any medical study conducted in the states there already exist strict protocols on when and how it can be used."
"Maybe I’m not understanding this correctly, but to have a lasting negative impact on humanity wouldn’t the human with a “wrong move” need to have children to pass down the genes? In which case it seems it would be easy to find and locate this gene since we don’t exactly breed the fastest."

"I know nothing, but everyone in the thread is saying good things, soooooooo I trust it."
Create 1 super smart human using gene editing but keep them from reproducing and they will tell us what to do and how to solve all of world's problems. Solved.
I'm a fair haired white girl and I also have thalassemia. It took us ages to find it though. Mines the minor version so I only had low iron and small blood cells so it didn't affect much.
"Presumably beta thalassemia if he was told he would have lifelong disease and it has adapted to make other globins. Could be alpha but I believe HPFH (high persistence of fetal hemoglobin) is more common than persistence of earlier alpha globins (tbh never heard of that happening, but theoretically possible)."
This is some Gattaca shit.
Oh. That is pretty damn severe. And articles on this subject always make it seem as if the patient popped in for a cafe latte and a round of CRISPR.

That guy made a change in every single cell of a person without fully knowing what would happen, and he did it before the person could give consent.

"It also only had an effect on three people, so yeah.  It is inconsequential to the general public without years maybe decades of testing at the rate we're going."
"If you look at it from both schools of thought it’s terrifying.  

The religious see it as tampering with Gods work - essentially screwing around with perfection of the creator of the universe.  No one wants to incur the wrath of God or they don’t want to disappoint the almighty.

On the other hand science sees genetic work something that took hundreds of millions of years to get right, to produce us.  And now we’re screwing with it and could be making terrifying changes to our genetic makeup as a species.  Imagine the worst case scenarios, not just wiping out humans through death but maybe de-evolution, or creat sub and super variations of humans.

I think working to cure genetic disorders is crucial.  There are so many people suffering from faulty hardware and it would be a disservice to allow them to suffer in a shell.  But what if reversing genetic disease we could give genetic diseases?  New ones that are worse than what we’re curing?  Or we give them as punishment?

Genetics are amazing both wonderfully and terrifying at the same time.  But it’s not a genie we can put back in the bottle, so it’s got to be approached delicately and patiently."

This guy hemoglobins
Thank you for the response.  It’s really interesting to read about this sort of novel approach.
Thanks for the explanation. But isn't it that the gene for gamma globin is turned off? Cause gamma replaces HbF.
Also just turning on the fetal gene is a less risky.  If it doesn’t work your essentially right back where you started with your regular adult genes still ‘working.’
"Here's an analogy just in case anyone is still confused:

Imagine an ex-football player who has recently been released from prison for stock manipulation.  Due to the current state of affairs, he's moved away from the city to herd sheep and possibly settle down with a wholesome woman who doesn't love him only for his fame and wealth.  One day Hemoglobin his favourite sheep does not return from grazing on the foggy pastures.  The entire town whose population of 30 come together to find said sheep.  Along the way they ask every wolf and fox if they've done something to the sheep.  They all deny any wrong doing.  Of course no one in the town believes any of them because of their past deeds.  I hope this clears things up a bit.  Stay safe everyone."
"My sister and my mom have the fatigue symptoms of beta thalassemia.   I'm a carrier for this, but other than a quick test when I was a kid ive never discussed it with a doctor.

Anyone know if this medically/genetically factual?  Theres a racist stripe in that side of my family, but my biological clock is ticking and i need answers."
I want to do this to myself. I have beta thal and not that it's life threatening but my iron is always low and I'm constantly tired.
"Thank you for your response.  I love your enthusiasm, it shines through in the way you write."
"If were able able to cure cancer with it, will most people just live long enough to get Alzheimer's?"
"Something I wonder though is that the next logical step is to also correct this in the reproductive cells. Ideally we correct this so it cannot be passed on. What scares me then is do we then start mucking around with things that aren’t horrible genetic diseases.

Secondary concern are, some of these diseases stayed around because they had an evolutionary benefit (sickle cell vs malaria) Any risk that we wipe out a genetic trait that we might regret 200 years in the future."
Thank you for the response. The human body is wildly complex.... I love reading about stuff like this.
"Unfortunately there aren’t many good drugs that induce fetal hemoglobin, and the majority of people in the world that have sickle cell disease live in sub Saharan Africa or India which will probably limit the accessibility of gene therapy to treat the disease."

Crispy humans. Or crispmans
"Studying the Maillard Reaction on humans.

Edit: OP spelled it CRISPER before edit."
I would pay for this. I wish this was real
CRISPR is just a process for editing your genome with accuracy. Upgraded versions would be processes that take this concept an improve on it.
It is both
Your face will be both.
Someone understands history.
I studied CRISPR a decade ago in college. It's not exactly taking the world by storm
"> I learned about CRISPER back 4 years ago when they first started learning about this new technology.

CRISPR has been discovered somewhere in the 80's... not 4 years ago. Human trials are a bit more recent, but this tech really isn't that new. Hell you can buy your own CRISPR kit at home about 5 years now.

From your other comment on ""why this could be used for evil""

> Think about it. You can cut DNA to change genetics. Let that sink in...

...

You mean the same thing viruses and bacteria have been doing to DNA for literally billions of years? CRISPR is just a collection of DNA sequences from bacteria that hold the ""instructions"" to detect and destroy DNA foreign to the host. You need other proteins to actually edit DNA and doing this inside a living cell, let a lone inside a living organism is a whole other deal. Hell, scientist have been genetically modifying living organisms long before CRISPR was even discovered...

To get back on the ethical question. All this critique on your knowledge isn't to say there aren't any ethical concerns with CRISPR, of course there are. We are basically talking about taking over the course of evolution of our selves and probably the species around us. Any technology that can be used for good can be used for evil. You can make a nuclear power plant that's basically fool proof or you can build a bomb that can level a city and ruin the land for decades to come, does that say anything ethical about nuclear fission it's self? 

It's a really important discussion to be had, as a society. Maybe even more important is that we have this debate based on knowledge and ethics, not on misunderstanding and fear. Saying stuff like ""Think about it. You can cut DNA to change genetics. Let that sink in..."" is just inviting people who don't know what the hell CRISPR is to fantasize about all the creepy they could imagine DNA could do... Which is great for entertainment, it's not a coincidence Cronenberg's horror movies came about the same time we started to play with DNA, but it has nothing to do with setting realistic expectations."
">I immediately knew this could be used the most evil shit.

In what kind of ways?"
"It's not super important, but just a heads up, there's no E in CRISPR"
Have you ever eaten yogurt? Because I've got news for you.
"> I immediately knew this could be used the most evil shit.

So can fire, the wheel and pointy sticks."
Which species is producing the science?
"Science going rogue and destroying humanity is an age old story.

Good for Hollywood.

Bad for science. 


Source: BF is a scientist and he fucking wishes one result would go rogue. Instead it’s like 1000 Petri dishes with slight variations for 2 weeks at a time, and then recording results.

And then I have to hear about “wow! Hey! There’s a gene In mice that prevents the flu virus”"
"Science brought the world to hold 8 Billion human beings, it has reduced it by somewhere between 150 million low estimate to 1 billion high estimate.

Seems like even fusion technology did more good that bad."
"No. But those same technologies create rockets, CT scanners, and artificial vitamins (speaking of cyanide in the last case).

It's true that some people will take the best things we've created and use them for ill, but it's not a given, nor a reason to stop creating. 

If that was true, we should definitely have stopped before we created words."
You really don’t need a PhD to succeed where that user failed. I’ll give them this; It’s a safe bet until it isn’t. Just like this will be used for good... until it isn’t. While “this idea has been around for a millennia” it’s also literally been around long enough for shit people to daydream of fucked up genetic permutations. Maybe even try them in some countries. Far cries from “for the good”.
Where's yours? You pessimistic weirdo
Your skepticism and key points are very warranted in the 1990s.
And with the right mistake your nips will blow!
"No, they only edit bone marrow cells after they've been removed from the body here.  There's no way for this sort of treatment to affect anything reproduction related."
"Say for example people are genetically modified as embryos to remove a given hereditary disorder. 

And over the short term that might be fine. 
It might be decades of life before any negative effects happen to those genetically modified people

What happens if any children produced by those grown people? What happens to any unknown children?
What happens when corrupted genes find their way, in whatever sense, into the human gene pool. Lasting impacts would occur. 

It's very much a ""worst case scenario"" and there are many other ethical barriers to cross. But without careful consideration it's a possibility."
Thanks! I’ll give them a shot

My wife has thalassemia beta minor as well. Red headed white girl.
"At the moment there are a bunch of people working on more specific ways of getting the bone marrow ready for a stem cell transplant (including me for my PhD project)

There are a couple of antibody based approaches that are already at stage 2 clinical trials. For several of these approaches in-vivo studies in mice have shown a similar effectiveness in bone marrow conditioning to chemotherapy without the side effects. So I think there will be some new approaches on the market in 10-20 years or so if all goes well.

Once that happens, it will open up hematopoetic stem cell (HSC) based treatments for a whole range of diseases. There are a lot of diseases we can easily treat with edited HSCs or donor healthy HSCs, but currently the danger of chemotherapy don't allow it as a treatment option."
It explicitly says in this summarised article there were severe side effects from the chemotherapy.
"Depends - the Hunter syndrome CRISPR trials didn't require this, they simply treated them with a large enough dose to have a significant effect on the liver cells so the change would persist over time with cell division of ""fixed"" cells."

"Collapsing when doing any physical activity and having to get blood transfusions sounds a lot worse than potentially getting leukemia, at some point, maybe ... in the future

Your argument could be taken further: don’t save car crash victims, they might develop leukemia later in life, better to put them out of their misery."
I'm pretty sure that's not how it works lol
would it really be better if you just believe

Yeh it could be an autoimmune disorder of some type.
How can we make sure that this research gets boatloads of money?
"I hear that they've found the cells responsible for recording immunie responses so that first bit's less of a problem, theoretically, and I'm also pretty sure that they've figured out some good ways to strip the differentiation from cells as well."
"Only as painful as your average bone marrow transplant. Which is to say, very very painful.

Fun fact, it's a thick yellowish liquid in the core of your bones. I'm not too sure where they drew from in this case but marrow biopsies go into the back of your hip bones. Not fun to watch. Or very fun, depending on your point of view. I've heard that the negative pressure inside the bone during extraction is exceedingly painful, though the copious amounts of lidocaine help."
"It's not a genie we should be bottling. At what point in the history of our evolution was it ever appropriate to determine how and why we evolved? It has never been an option until now. 

There is no moral dilemma here. Consider two things: The human brain is a product of our evolution and the origin of this technology; Secondly, our evolution has been relatively halted because that same brain considers compassion for the weak and sick as a moral imperative instead of letting them die. 

If you can recognize the production of technology is necessarily a product of human ingenuity and thought, and that our intelligent is a result of our evolved brains, then our technology is part and parcel to our evolution. It's not a step away from our evolutionary path, technology is our evolutionary path. 

We have a moral obligation to use the technology we develop to advance our evolution. 

Religious people are deliberately and fundamentally ignorant of basic logic and philosophy and their opinions shouldn't be considered for any reason."

"Gamma globulin is part of the HbF molecule. The gene turns off after you're born, causing gamma to be replaced with beta globulin. In beta thalassemia, the beta globulin isn't produced enough, so this treatment turns the gene for gamma globulin back on."
"I'll give you a nice complete answer in a few minute, just walking home in the rain. Short answer: it's inheritable and most common in Mediterranean populations. Sounds slightly racist because it kinda is."
"Thanks :) I know a few people who would have their lives completely changed by CRISPR, and I know there are millions more I've never met. 

It will take medical science to a whole new level where previously fatal and horrifying conditions are fixed with just an injection. How is that not incredibly exciting?"
"I don't know about stopping cancer before it forms, but I've heard of treating cancer with CRISPR - you create super cells trained specifically to eradicate the cancer you have. I supposed eventually they can super-charge an immune system to stop cancerous cells early when they form so you don't need specific treatment each time.

Alzheimer's is maybe something they can also treat by giving people a booster shot to reduce the risk by turning off genes that increase risk, and turning on genes that have a benefit. Not sure about direct treatment - if they can stop or reverse the causes it might be possible."
">What scares me then is do we then start mucking around with things that aren’t horrible genetic diseases.

It'll happen much quicker than you think. We already know of genes that are good to have (or good to have deleted/mutated) - higher resistance to diseases including immunity to HIV (CCR-5), higher resistance to diabetes (SLC30A8), protection or prevention of high cholesterol (CETP), reduced risk of Parkinsons (SGK1), reduced risk of heard disease (PCSK9 and Apo-AIM), increased bone density (LRP5), improved muscle development (Asb15, Klf10, and Tpt1), possible tetrachromatic ""four-color"" vision (bunch of genes).

And there is a bigger list of stuff you don't want, which is probably what we'll see first. You have the things that are definitely terrible, the things that give you a higher than normal risk, then the things that are not great to have."

"I'm not a hematologist nor even close to an expert in the subject, but what I can offer is I know the gamma subunits on HgF allow for greater affinity/tighter binding to oxygen over the beta subunits in HgA. Physiologically, if the bond with oxygen is stronger, that means it has a more difficult time leaving the Hg molecule to deposit into the tissues that require oxygenation, so maybe that's part of the reason why if increases in metabolism require that shift?

Comment
"Well my mother had a fucking ugly couch from the early nineties. Nobody wanted that piece of eternal hell of a fabric and pattern right out of satans ass. 

Disposal fee was something like 50$. But I am sure it still haunting someone somewhere."
I used to work for college hunks hauling junk. We charged $120 to pick up couches.  Sometimes they were torn and covered in cat hair and piss. We would have to pay to dump them. Other times they were mint condition high end pieces of furniture and we could resell them at thrift shops.  People paid the fee all day long.
"You’d be surprised how hard it is to get rid of large items like mattresses and couches. I see people trying to give them away for free all the time but people don’t want to risk bringing in bed bugs, etc. When I was moving, I needed to get rid of my mattress but there weren’t any takers and some guy from Craigslist offered to take my mattress for $20 so I ended up paying him. His car was loaded up with other mattresses so I imagine he makes good money doing what he does."
Tell them that’s fine but the couch is now $20
Does anyone else feel like they would never in their life get a used couch? Maybe I'm too paranoid about bed bugs but there isn't a chance that I would take used soft furniture.
"That's where you say ""It's no longer free. It now costs $20. Since you charge $20 to pick up we can call it even"""
I bet that's gonna be a Karen in a few years just wait
"I mean I kind of get it.

Giving it away for free kind of implies you really don't want it. It implies you ""want it gone"".

If it's been on Craigslist for more than a few days or even weeks, that sort of implies no one else is really interested either.

Hauling a couch away is non trivial.

The asker is merely assuming ""It seems like you're having no luck getting rid of that couch. I'll get that couch out of your hair for $20"".

Admittedly, it's a little bold of the ""asker"" to make the assumption, but it's not a terribly unreasonable request.

If I had a couch I wanted gone, and someone offered to deal with carrying out and transporting it away for $20, I'd probably do it."
Just put the couch out in front of your house and hang a $20 for sale sign on it.  It'll disappear by the next day.
"I mean it does cost money to remove large goods from homes, I guess it depends what position the seller is in, they may be desperate to move it out"
"there are certainly used couches that no one would want in their home.

i am pretty sure you have to pay to get rid of an old mattress or if you buy a new one, the mattress seller will take the old one away but they sure don't pay u for it.

bottom line, many things i have purchased, even things in good shape, no one wanted to buy either at all or for anything near what i had paid for them. i pretty much gave away my furniture once, probably could have sold it but ran out of time and did not have patience."
"They are trying to tell you that if you want someone to junk your trash you should pay for it, and not abuse underprivileged"
"I dunno. Depends on the condition of the couch. If you wanted to dump the couch, a company would charge a lot more where I’m from to pick it up and take it to the dump. 
If the couch is in shitty condition it’s not unreasonable"
"ITT: people get down voted for pointing out that junk hauling can cost money. We really don't know what shape the couch is in lmao, the CB could very easily be the person with the couch"
"Actually, I might do this depending on its condition and how many flights of stairs I'd have to move it. We live on 4th floor and had an 800 pound/350kg piano we wanted to remove. Fortunately, our neighbor is a music teacher and was able to find someone to take it for free. They hired a crew. I would have paid someone a lot more than $20 to take it. If it was a newer piano or a good brand, I probably wouldn't pay, but ours I definitely would have. The same with the couch, if it was an off-brand or poor or average condition, I'd pay someone to remove it if I lived in the 4th floor"
To. Be. HONEST. If you are waiting on a new couch to be delivered OR moving house and it needs to go. If they have had it online for free and no one has showed interest then $20 to take it away not a bad offer. Without renting a van or paying someone how will you move it anyway?
"Depends on the couch. Unless you have people clamoring to take it, you might be the choosing beggar here."
Wants somebody to haul away their trash for free.
[deleted]
I love when someone posts on Craigslist junk/junky furniture that requires 4 people and a truck to get out of the house because they are too cheap to hire a removal service. The free couch giver is def a choosing beggar. Thanks for the post!
"When we left England to move to Australia my dad got this guy who owns a second hand shop to come over, he told the dude he could have all the furniture for free he just had to pick it up. Dude was like ‘nah I don’t want any of this, but if you pay me £50 I’ll take it to the dump for you’. Yeah dude surree a+ for trying."
This is actually very normal. I understand the person may not be thinking the same way as a typically mover but I have charged people many times to move a couch from there house for money it’s a typical fee. Not supporting beggar behavior but if the couch was a nuisance then it’s justifiable
That’s the point of “Free” couch. Trying to get free labor.
Artist didn’t even get paid in exposure.
You won’t even get paid in exposure.
"Actually I'm not too put off by this one. After a few weeks, sure I'll add $20 just to get it out of my house."
I can go broke sitting on my couch.
It went from 0 to 100 real fucking quick
Believe it or not I actually had a side hustle picking up stuff like couches for payment. Obviously it was not posted as free but a lot of items people payed me to remove were perfectly good. Sometimes I would get payed to go pick it up and post it for sale same day and then sell it that same day.
"Actually dump fees are more than $20 in my area, plus the labor and time to haul it. Sounds like a good deal to me."
"People on facebook marketplace may lack a lot of things, but they never lack the audacity"
The heck?
"What will happen: takes couch, takes $20, drives off and their mate on the back pushes couch off the pickup 100m down your road.

Well done, you just got scammed."
Well yeah. The only reason people ever post stuff for free on places like FB marketplace and Craigslist is because they want the item gone and are either unable to move it themselves or unable to afford to have it disposed of. This asker clearly has no interest in owning the couch. They’re offering to come and get it and dispose of it for you for a lot less than what you would otherwise pay.
FREE - FREE USED COUCH - USED COUCH
"She's obviously trying to get rid of her old shitty couch, junk trucks aren't cheap, trash company charge for furniture, the dump costs money and you need a truck to get it there, i say take the 20 bucks,  nobody wants your smelly old couch lady"
"Also, people who work for themselves tend to stand by the quality of their work more than others, that stuff you should be getting isn't actually free, it's just already paid for."
Lmao this is some next level facepalm.
I'd literally rather drag it to the end of the street. It'd be gone in under 30 minutes
It went from 0 to 100 real fucking quick
It doesn't sound like a good crumple zone.
Not choosy at all.
"Well, looks like an “s” to imply multiple.

So, one set of teeth. Pictures are really gross, don’t vote for change that we need video evidence of police brutality"
Tbf for big items that you want to get rid of it's not unreasonable to ask for a fee.
Meaning he was going to get anyway.
I recently paid a junk company over 100 dollars to haul a couch out of my dad's house. This seems like a good deal to me. Downvote
I absolutely love seeing this person's keybaord thanks so much for not cropping this
I'm dumbass. Thought that said FREE USED CONDOM and was like wtf
This happens to me anytime I offer something for free. Someone once “offered” me 100 bucks to come pick up a truckload of pavers. I got dozens of offers to get them.
"My company offers free samples, free if you pick them up but you have to pay shipping and handling. 

I get countless complaints from emails and calls saying how is it not free if you have to pay shopping and handling"
"The seller/giver might be the choosing begger here depending on the couch. We can’t really see how the couch looks like. If the couch is shitty and they live up on 4th floor with no elevator, then they should be overjoyed that someone is willing to dump the couch for them for only $20."
[deleted]
"""for a 20$ fee"" haha fuck off"
If nobody wanted the couch what are your options for getting rid of it?
"We could have a double-sided choosing beggar situation here. Couch could be so crappy that nobody in their right mind would take it away for free. The giver might not be so ""giving""..."
hmmm porn?
"Maybe she thought you wanted anal on the couch?

thus $20, her regular fee.  (includes $15 gas money and $3 for snacks)"
"I assume they think you’ll pay them to take the couch to the dump, it’d probably cost 20$ to get rid of a couch at the dump"
Shit does work like this though. If you cant find someone to take it for free you would have to pay to get rid of a couch - $20 is a good deal.
"In some places, there is a fee to have the regular garbage collectors take large items.  If the offerer was unable to find a taker, they may need to pay to get rid of the couch."
"Sadly, in places like Japan, getting rid of it for free (if not giving it to someone) costs money since you can’t just throw it outside. Illegal.."
I tried to get rid of a perfectly good couch for a few days and in the end I just ran out of time and had to organise a friend’s trailer and pay something like au$70 to dump it legally. So I probably would of paid this guy $20 to come take it
Removal services charge maybe that's what he meant
Most city councils
Some people try to act like “junk be gone” services to haul stuff to the dump. We had to pay a guy $50 to pickup a 30 yr old king sized mattress. I assume he was taking it to the dumb but he might have turned around and tried to sell it for $50 on Craigslist.
"I was trying to give away some big items, and I almost decided to pay someone to take it. Especially since covid started my trash an wasn't taking big items and thrift stores wasn't taking drop offs. If someone has a dumpy couch what are they supposed to do if they already have a replacement. Paying someone to come by with a truck and load your heavy garbage is a great deal for $20. This sub is desperate for content sometimes"
I've been trying to get rid of my mattress after upgrading and I'd be willing to pay someone $20 to come get it out of my house.
"I’d do it.  I’d be willing to pay more, esp if it’s difficult to remove. That couch is garbage"
Wimmin empowerment at its finest.
"“piece of eternal hell of fanfic and pattern right out of satans ass.”

nice."
"I don’t understand why this is hard for so many here to understand.  If nobody wants the couch, the owner of it will need to pay more then $20 to have it hauled away to dump.   So paying someone to take away old furniture isn’t crazy at all.   The main thing we don’t know here is what condition the couch was in"
"He dont use emojis here, go back to Instagram"
"9 out of 10 times a used couch *is* trash. Look at that design, that couch is dated, and likely used and abused. It's garbage. No one's going to pay for it."
Tbf the couch has become trash to this person if they’re giving it away for free
It depends on who I’m getting it from tbh. Family or a close friend? Hell yeah I’ll take a used couch! From a complete stranger? Absolutely not
We got a (cheap) used ikea couch before we got a kid. Washed the covers. And boy is it nice not having to care about the couch with a 3 year old around! There is enough other stuff to worry about. We can get a nice couch when she is older:-)
"Yeah I've seen lots of decent looking furniture laying on the sidewalk waiting to be picked up here in NYC (dressers, etc) but the fear of bed buds (and experience therewith) makes picking them up an absolute no-no."

"I did something similar with an old fridge and stove. But my city collects large pieces for free. And for metal things, if you leave it at the curb it will be fine within the hour for scrap metal.

  


Someone replied to my kijiji post saying they will pick it up for $50. I told them it is free, then they made it clear they wanted me to pay them the $50, I said no. Then they eventually said they'll pick it up for free (they still make money from scrap metal). No, too late someone else is coming for it. Then they started begging to let them get it instead.... It was satisfying to reject them."
Ha! That's not possible either if the community you live in doesn't allow it. You'll lose the couch and have to pay a fees to the community to put stuff on the front yard.
That's not how CB works tho.  It's their post. It was up for free. Anyone can see that. But trying to haggle a price to come get it . Thats being a CB. I'd like to know how OP is considered a CB befause I just dont see it
I can go broke sitting on my couch.
"Assuming OP is from America, you fall into either one of two categories in this country.

1) you own a truck/trailer

2) you know someone who owns a truck/trailer

If you fall into category two, 4 times out of 5 that person is just glad to help you out for free no strings attached. The 1/5 is because you’re really bad at picking out friends

Did I over exaggerate? Sure, but the odds still stand in favor of the couch recipient having access to a truck/trailer for free (at least in America)"
"Impossible. Even if the couch was complete trash, you are not a chosing beggar to give it away for free, and you cant be forced to go below zero.

You cant ask too much and want overprice if you have the price of 0."
"Messenger automatically creates those, with the sellers name and the listings name"
"Yes, thank goodness r/croppingishard, otherwise we would've missed this gem"

Why on earth would it cost $150 to take it to the dump?  All I have to do is call the local refuse company and they'll pick it up and take it to the dump for free.
"Not sure why you're getting down-voted for asking a question.
Most cities have a number for picking up large items.
Where I live (Los Angeles) it's actually free pick-up(311)."
"Maybe. But who in their right mind would give away a great couch for free? Giver has the couch taken off their hands and the taker gets a free couch. How is that a double sided choosing beggar? If you don't like the couch, move along."
Yeah sometimes i pay the garbage guys some cash for them to get rid of big ol furniture. But if this is a good condition furniture thats Op giving away than its a different story.
"I do that sometimes because it costs money to dispose large furnitures at the municipal disposal, not including the time and effort to transport them. 
With that being said, I wouldn't ask someone to pay in this context, where the listing indicates otherwise."
"Our city has a big garbage pick-up once a month for free. You just have to leave the stuff at the curb on the day of. That goes for furniture, appliances, basically whatever doesn't fit in your bin except for construction/renovation materials."
"I need to take some stuff to the dump and looked it up yesterday. It costs $80 for up to 1/2 ton. It doesn't matter if you have 1 item or 1/2 ton it is $80.  Obviously more per each 1/2 ton.

I wish it would be $20, I would happily pay that."
"Dump hell, they'll drop it in the woods nearby and pocket the twenty."
"30 here so it's actually saving you money, giving away a couch is what you try before you fork over the 30"
Dumping them on the highway is free.
I'd rather pay the 20 bucks at the dump then pay some dumb ass like the girl in the post lol
"Yeah, that’s after you can’t find someone to take it for free, though and completely up to what the person in possession of the couch wants. This is just someone trying to get paid to get a free couch."
That would be a nice gift to yourself.
"When it was time to get rid of my old apple mac G3 tower, I cut it into very small bits and hid it with the regular trash. Not even the eagle eyed obachan on the ground floor detected it/"
"Yeah large cities often have plenty people trying to get rid of couches and other large furniture they don't have space for or can't move with them. It's end of college season now, thousands of students moving away after graduation. They got a bland, kinda old couch for free when they moved in and they're trying to pass it on but there's no one to take it because there's 20 for every interested person."
That's all this is. Lots of people don't own trucks or have the physical mobility necessary to move a couch themselves. This is just a person that has a big item that they no longer want and they haven't realized that the used couch market isn't huge. You'd be hard pressed to even donate it unless it was a really nice couch in good condition.
"True that. We had been trying to get rid of a $1100 used couch for a month. We listed the price as $100 but no takers. Finally, had to pay $30 to the handyman to get a truck and take it to dumpyard. This was in Miami though."
"Stop shoehorning your slash fiction into conversations, Terry."

Which is why it’s free I’m guessing...
"When I moved into my first apartment by myself, I got a free couch that would probably otherwise be considered trash. But it was a couch, and I was poor, and I had nothing. So even if you hate it, someone somewhere may appreciate it."
"I'd have to see the couch. I've seen some free furniture on Craigslist that you would definitely be doing then a big favor by taking. Couches that look like they've lived outside.

I could see the person offering $20 making light of one of those situations."
This is the thought process that leads to these posts in the first place
"If I had land I'd take them, bug-spray them, and leave them out in the August heat in black trash bags for a few days.  Foolproof bed bug solution."
Yeah man that would be terrible and I love your name
"I have a giant tv in the basement that came with the house. I would consider putting it up for free to see if there was any interest, but if someone offered me to come grab it for $20, I'd happily pay."
"We have absolutely no idea what happened here, there is 0 context. All I'm saying is that there are extremely valid reasons that people might not want a free couch - maybe this was a 6 week old post and someone with a pickup was trying to make some money."
"Not nearly as many people own a truck in the city. People rely on public transit and parking a truck in the city is a lot harder, so people tend to have smaller vehicles. I know folks who get around by bike or scooter, but zero truck friends. My parents have trucks, but they’re in another state."
Ehhh fair point i didn't phrase it right. Should've just said the other person wasn't a CB.
You are a choosing beggar if you are looking for someone to provide you trash service for free.
Okay that I didn't know.
"I don’t think you understand Occam’s razor. 

In this case we know two things:
1. Someone wants to give a away a sofa for free
2. Someone doesn’t believe that it’s worth picking up the sofa for free

Therefore it’s reasonable to assume that either the person wanting money is a Karen, or the sofa is trash and the the person giving it away is stupid for thinking that someone would bother picking up and dumping thrash for them for free. 

If I had made up a totally convoluted story that made no sense, then yes I can understand what you mean. But Occam’s razor has nothing to do with this."
"Where the heck are you? I've never heard of anyone calling their refuse company for this sort of thing. You just put it out and get a charge for it, or they wont take it."
It may work that way for you but in other parts of the world you would pay for such service or get an allowance of how many times you can do hard rubbish per year.
"Yeah, I'm not sure either! I don't post often but think that's my first that's had negative votes. I wondered if it costs to remove items. I live in London and a charity might take it for free, if not the city charges £34. It sounds like that's not the case in the USA.
Edit: also seen others make similar points to me without being downvoted so who knows?"
"Same in Chicago. We can actually just leave the furniture by our bins, but best to give them a heads up. No extra cost."
"Exactly, it goes like this, you list for a while and, if nobody has decided they want it for free after whatever reasonable time you decide, then you start thinking about paying to dispose.

God these people are trash."
In my neighborhood there’s people that drive around in shitty pick up trucks and take anything of value from the trash so the garbage men never have to deal with it .
Disassemble and find a dumpster and throw it away piece by piece.
"We have it once a season, but you can also schedule one item to be picked up any day.  However, when I'm moving and the last few items suddenly don't seem worth taking... It's easier to just give some guy with a pickup $40 to deal with it."
"Even if you’re a county resident, dumping residential trash? Around here, the only people who pay are commercial contractors/landscape/etc. If I wanted to just take a couch, and old TV, used oil, or some yard trimmings, it is free for me, because I pay for trash removal every month.  Here I can literally take a bag of trash, if I wanted/needed to."
"My town hosts a giant landfill for my whole region, so town residents get a lot of perks. They'll take just about anything curbside for free"
"Our trash truck will pick it up, $50 for oversized items."
"I live in a pretty big city and I could only find removal for about $100. I had a huge wooden frame couch that was junk. The front legs fell off all the time, a spring had popped and ripped a massive hole in the back. The cushions were torn. It was a solid frame but the rest was just trash. 

I was going to pay one of those companies to haul it but last second, somebody said to post it on fb marketplace and that I would be surprised. I figured no harm in trying, so I put it on there for free, and listed all the problems with it. It was pickup only, you had to haul it down from the 6th floor. The first picture was of the massive hole in the back and then there were more pics of all the issues and the rest of the couch. 

Within ten minutes, I had 20 messages asking if it was still available. It was gone within an hour and it didn't cost me a cent."
Pretty much all trash can be disposed of free of charge in the Netherlands. Stopped people from dumping their shit at random places or in nature.
"Does anyone know if this is true about tires?  My husband said that tires have numbers on them and they can tell who threw away a tire and will come after you.  I asked because we have this tire that’s been sitting there forever and I told him to just toss it in the garbage bin when it goes out, like who’s gona know it MY tire? No one, that’s who."
You PAY money to throw stuff away? That sounds.. uuh.. counterproductive.

$20 for pickup and disposal is cheap as hell. All the dumps around me are	 around $90/ton
How is he a dumbass? The couch looks gross. Nobody is going to take it. He offered a good deal and a way for her to get rid of it immediately and she should have jumped on it.
You might not have a vehicle to take it to the dump? Most people don't have pickup trucka
That’s assuming you have the proper vehicle and somebody to help you get it there
"$20 for her to take it to the dump is less than the cost of a pickup truck rental/purchase, the dumping fee, and time spent."
"That’s one way, lol.
My Japanese friends do the same, too.
Was talking about how I would throw my trash can and they said just cut it into small pieces.."
As a thank you for that long
Why are you downvoting me
"My bad, but yes it costs money to dispose of couches

Not sure why I'm being downvoted, have none of you tried to dispose of furniture before? lol"
The only thing that's pricey about a free couch is the truck needed to move it.
No... the needy person is the one trying to get rid of a used couch for free that nobody will want. This person probably hauls junk for a living and $20 to get rid of a couch is a pretty good deal.
thanks lad
Nothing here suggests that.
"I'm in Central California.  They call it ""Bulky Item Pick Up"".  I guess I should probably mention that we only get to do this for free 4 times per year.  But even so, it has been super useful (got rid of an old dishwasher and a mattress this way) and I think we've only hit our yearly max once in the last several years."
"You do realize that not everybody lives in a city with free garbage collection, right?"
That's awesome.
"In my experience if you want to *give something away* you nonetheless advertise it as selling it for a small amount, 20-50 dollars, and let people *talk you down*. I've had very happy people handing me 5$ and getting a *steal*. They drive away feeling like master negotiators, I get rid of my shit and bonus pocket money. 

Putting things up for ""free"", I dunno, people always assume somethings wrong with it and the ones that do show up are giant pains in my ass.


I never put things up for free anymore"
Sounds like alot of people dont have to deal with it not just the garbage men.
"I lit mine on fire, it fit in the dumpster with no issue after that"
New construction sites are great for that.
Goodwill and most charities will come pick up large items for free.
Not having to do that is totally worth $20
"At my last residence, you had to pay a private company to pick up your trash. They did not pick up recycling. The dump was about 5-6 miles from my house and you could drop off your trash and recycling for free. I was heading there weekly for recycling so why pay someone to take trash that i could dump for free? I was the only one in my neighborhood that recycled. Trash day came around and people's cardboard would be next to the trashcan or sticking out of it."
"And that sort of restriction will cause people to do the wrong thing and dump it somewhere.

Pay 20 bucks to do the right thing, or just chuck it at some random dumpster and let them clean it up anyways? I think we know what many, many people would do."
"It takes labor, proper tools/machinery and time to process garbage, especially furniture."
you pay taxes and refuse service fees to have your bin emptied every week. what is the difference? *YOU* pay money to throw stuff away too.
"We have a bulk item pick up now and then and they will haul it from the curb. I am cleaning out my garage and just have a pick up load of crap to get rid of. 
I can fill my can with it twice a week but that would take 2 months to get rid of it. I already pay for that so it would be free. 
But to haul 1 pick up truckload to the dump would cost me $80. Sucks. I know."
Or it’s a nice couch that is with more and paying someone to take it is stupid?
You have obviously never given away a couch. The poster obviously knew it was gross so they were going to give it away for free. I can tell you have never been in this position before as someone will ALWAYS want it if it's free. I would much rather wait a few days as it was already sitting there doing nothing then pay some broke skeevy mf to take my couch. If anything I'll leave it on the curb before I paid a dime to this beggar.
"Because a lot of people use emojis here and you seem like a douche bag.

Edit: just seen your post history, you are indeed a douche, douche."
"Because of your insufferable nerd elitism.

I am actually pleasantly surprised to see these downvotes because it's not an uncommon sentiment. For whatever strange reason, redditors seem to believe that emojis are for ""normies,"" which is why they are so rare here."
What do you think
"Yeah after reading some comments $20 to get rid of it for the seller might actually be a bargain. 

If they’d come in saying “hey I do disposals, if no one takes this off your hands I’ll dump it for you for $20” seller might have responded a bit differently."
"I’ve got someone coming for free to pick one up today. If they don’t grab it, then I’ll have to pay to dispose of it. Lol I’d probably give someone $20 to take it, otherwise it cost me time and $25 to bring it to the dump 20 minutes away. Not worth it. Here’s $20."
"The first garbage collection day of the month takes bulky items like couches and appliances like fridge, washer and dryer etc. It's bundled with my normal garbage collection. You just put it on the curb. People know this and go around looking for used old furniture that people discard."
"Excuse me, but there are plenty people giving away free furniture that still looks great. I've gotten a few free couches, tables etc online. Just because it's free doesn't mean it's trash. I still have the same free TV stand I picked up years ago, still looks near perfect save for the few scratches on the front from vacuuming."
No problems comrade
"The key to free listings is to set said object by mailbox, and reply to all messages with “Free object is sitting by mailbox at xxx address, FCFS. No need to ring bell.  Please come and pick it up at your leisure.”  At least, that’s my method of getting rid of junk."
Is this what having level 100 in speech is like
"Exactly. This is what I do all the time.  I never ever list anything for FREE ... it just brings all the weirdos out of the woodwork.  But when I list something like a perfectly good couch for like $20 I tend to get actually-sane people, who subsequently can actually follow directions and both A) being a vehicle which can hold the item, and B) don’t ask me to help them load it.  And they’re super happy they’re getting a steal, so 9 out of 10 times they just give me the money and don’t even question. But that 10th person ... well, as soon as they try any shit it’s super satisfying to not even acknowledge their offer, open the front door and say “ok, thanks for coming by!”"
"This is spot on. I think bottom feeders just spend their day searching “FREE”. They don’t care about the item. They prob just want to resell it or hoard shit they don’t need. 

Had the same thing as the OP happen to me. Free sofa listed and the ad brought out the crazies. Listed again for $100 and sold it for $80 ...and the guy even rented a truck to pick it up. 

It’s about triaging the quality of responders. Listing for free results in low quality people. And don’t mistake that for poor people. I was trying to give away NIB toys to a needy family during the holidays and some bitch gave me this sob story about this and that, then picked up the shit in a Nissan Armada with dealer plates."
Some quantum thinking right there.
"Not currently, at least not where I live. I tried to schedule one the other day and they told me they've stopped because of covid."
"Um, yes? They recycle as much as they can, but yes, giant mountains of trash are still a thing, all around the world."
"Uhh dude, the US is the world leader on landfilling.  We consume 20% of the global plastics, but are responsible for only 0.03% of all plastic entering the ocean annually.  Modern landfills are literally one of the most successful green initiatives in human history.  What the fuck are you on about?"
"Near me, there are several clothes donation bin things, where people can drop off clothes and shoes and stuff.  When corona happened, those things got *covered* in stuff that you’re not ‘supposed’ to throw away, like paint cans, tires, and furniture.  I think there needs to be more places to dispose of these things."
"I pay absolutely 0 money atm cuz I don't have a ""bin"". I live in a apartment. Also, if I were to go to the recyclingstation(which I am in a couple of days), I just drive in to the correct container/placement and throw my stuff there. Free.

Also we make energy and recycle the majority of our trash. We don't have landfill."
"Youve obviously never seen a couch sit on the street for months because someone put it on the curb and noone wanted that raggedy ass furniture. 

Ive put plenty of stuff out on the curb for free, and Ive seen stuff get taken immediately after I set it out, but you’re delusional if you think stuff ALWAYS gets taken. Couches especially can get pretty gross, and if they get left out in the rain, yeah, they are trash and no one is taking them."
Then you get a ticket for leaving your trashy ass garbage couch on your curb
So we can say that OP is the choosing beggar?
I’ve given away decent furniture because I moved in with someone and was tired of the clutter. I wanted it gone fast and I didn’t feel like waiting for Habitat for Humanity to pick it up.
blyat
"This.

Doesn't much work if you live in an apartment complex or an HOA that prohibits leaving stuff outside, but it's a sound concept.

One additional point:  

Once it's gone, take the ad down or edit it.

I assume that  /u/ste6168 does that, but simply didn't mention for the sake of brevity.

I have never been accused of brevity."
"We moved to our current location last year and had done my bi-yearly grocery trip a month before we found out we were moving. I posted the contents of my freezer up for free. This was $600-$800 of meat and the results were insane. I had over 30 requests in minutes. It was difficult to keep up and respond to everyone. I was called at sorts of hateful names if I didn't reply right away. I was told I was selfish because THEY needed it more than everyone else and I was denying their children food. (I blocked those people) That made me decide to not post anything for free ever again. Where I live now, people don't read ads and bombard me with questions that would have been answered had they taken 30 seconds to read. I block those people also."
"Yeah, but eventually it stops being *your* problem and just becomes ‘that couch out there’."
"If they can figure out who’s couch it is.  Pro tip, don’t leave it in front of *your* house."
"Honestly it *is* a bit choosing beggar-y when people put literal trash on Craigslist or FB Market.  I don't blame OP for giving it a go before throwing it away- you never know what someone will want.  I was paying a guy $40 to take a bunch of furniture I thought was trash, but his kids were sharing sharing beds and he was psyched to take my old mattresses and crappy Ikea frames."

A bull and two buffaloes
I think it’s Hyderabad
"To me, it looks like they're escorting the Lambo."
Thats some real Lambo shit there
"Well, when you do look closer into it,the lambo and the buffalos are.Related. So you can say

""Over here we see a lamborgini in its natural habitat""

Hint : Check the car logo"
Specifying India was redundant.

Bull is blocked by buffalo
This is oddly satisfying
Lamberghini chalayi jaane o
Something similar happened to me recently. Someone brought a porche to our society and the dogs started barking in unison at the car. No matter how expensive the car is the dogs would still bark at it . I find that hilarious
Is this model town?
Diversity biatch
This is actually funny xD
"Indian buffaloes beats ghini...!!

Buffaloes 1 - Lamborghini 0
"Fun fact, Lamborghinis are named after fighting bulls because its founder was a fan. Murcielago means Bat in Spanish, which made The Dark Knight even cooler."
so Lambirghinis don't need number plates?
Who REALLY owns the streets.

"This is Hyderabad, Jubilee Hills Road Number 36."
this encapsulates india perfectly haha
looks like bodyguards at the side
NEED FOR SPEED : INDIA
You can't find a more suitable picture defining the Indian traffic than this one.
That's cool but where's the front number plate?
I imagine that driving a Lamborghini in most parts of India wouldn’t be very satisfying.
"Buffalo : 1 

Lamborghini : 0"
Anybody remember that episode of Viva La Bam where Bam and Billy Idol cut a sunroof into his Lamborghini whith a chainsaw?  Why would somebody do that?
Buffalo : saanu bhi Jutta dedo
Buffaloes be like *No fucks given
Looks like there's a Cadillac behind the left one.
Lamborghini has horse power....Buffalo has Bull power.
What's the price of a lambo in India?
Why isn't the car having a numberplate?
Perfect welcome to India image
"Who knows, they may just be his security details.  /s"
Beasts escorting another beast
That red shirt guy at the back laughing.
It's pretty clear the Lambo(bull) got horny
Oh Bollocks! There are are bullocks !!
"This really reminds me of that song, oh good days"
Would be crazy if the buffaloes actually belong to the driver and he/she's herding them to the grazing ground.

Just like another day driving through the new forest (u.k.) Except its donkeys...and im driving an old banger on its last legs.
Love the colour of the lambo! You can see they’ve taken inspiration from the great indian buffalo!
Why are buffalo pulling the lambo ?

personally I would have blocked that asshole.
It's a Photoshop. You can see the edits by looking at the buffaloes outline and their contacting colours wrt the background
And I would have blocked that asshole.
Buffaloes must be like - Lamborghini chalai jaane oooo .... Sanu vee jjhoota de do kithe kalle kalle jaayi jaane ooooo

We have bigger buffaloes in Maharashtra.
Never knew people in India are so foolish to spend so much to go from point A to B.

"So if you're being serious, ""real ______ shit"" is like a little american phrase I guess. For example if you see someone wearing a cowboy hat someone could say ""that's some real texas shit"". Also the old rap music mixtape team Trapaholics slogan used to be ""real trap shit"". Trap being an american slang term used heavily in hiphop to describe the act of cooking/selling/bagging drugs in a drug house i.e. ""trapping"""
They're making a word play on bull shit by saying Lambo shit because the logo of Lambo is a bull.

Comment
People tend to look like they’re going to pass out after exercise. It’s called exercise.
"Where do these folks think all the air from their lungs go when they breath out into a mask? The volume in such a mask is tiny and it cant keep your breath in there.

&#x200B;

What is so hard to understand about this concept?

Also doctors dont die wearing them for hours also... \*sigh\*"
Isn\`t it like an altitude training mask?
I'm not defending the Karen but tbh I can't imagine working out in a face mask. I have glasses and if I breathe too hard I can't see anything lol
"Ok but to be fair, masks are meant to be worn for a finite amount of time. They do make breathing harder... honestly, I'd much rather workout at home where I can breathe than struggle in a gym."
I like how people without elementary school level understanding of biology rely on immune system so much
"he's jealous, cause he didn't got any oxigen when he was born"
"I need this mask. Was upset when it sold out, I'd literally pay $500 for something that wasn't hell working outdoors right now."
I would bet money this person is completely out of shape.
"Yeah, if only there was a company who made masks for workouts..."
"I used to use a pollution mask cycling in London. It did.make it harder to breath initially, like running with a slightly heavy back pack. But you get used to it. 3 years and 15,000 miles later I didn't notice the drag at all, and when I went mountain biking without the mask it felt really easy breathing. I also didn't need my asthma inhaler nearly as much as my lungs were used to overcoming this slight drag."

"I'm not so sure this is insane.  Everyone should be wearing a mask during normal movements, but I wouldn't wear one while also forcing my body to require far more oxygen than it normally does.

I can appreciate that she wants to protect others, but if you want to get a workout in while distancing or you're worried about potentially affecting others there's probably safer ways to do it than wearing a mask while exerting yourself in a gym."
[I was curious and they're $30 a mask for those wondering.](https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/ua-sportsmask/pid1368010)
It always cracks me up when these people say they've lost respect for a company. Like....ok? Congratulations?
anyone got a link to buy one? i think it looks cool and might help me breath train if it's like other masks in straining breath
I'm pretty sure that those people who go to gym just to sit on the equipment and play with their phone are genuinely shocked when they see someone sweating or get out of breath.
"Oh c’mon, we all know Karen didn’t go to the gym!"
She was envious of the mask
"Yes, that’s the point."
Tell this lady to google anaerobic respiration and watch her mind get blown
I didn’t know they let children in the gym unsupervised
I like how they made a mask to fix this problem and now the problem is their fault.
Where was Karen during the great Training Mask fad from like 5 years ago?
The insanity to me is that companies are making designer masks instead of the government actually dealing with the problem.
"Even pre-pandemic, it is has been the status quo for skiiers, snowboards and cyclists (especially in the city) to wear face masks. 

I have been masking up for years to ski and bike. 

I am still alive."
"Well, at least her spelling and punctuation is pretty good.  That's a refreshing change around here."
She's not completely wrong tho
It sounds like Under Armor is attempting to solve the very problem they are complaining about.
Maybe someone should put a muzzle on her
"You really should be running outdoors instead of in the gym. Especially right now, given that N95 and other masks reduce airflow. I don’t really see a market for this, though. Also fuck Karen."
"They reduce airflow by 20% 
So... best not to run In one. 
Not to mention they are not designed for heavy breathing and moisture."
I mean depending on what mask one is wearing it absolutely will affect your oxygen levels especially if you are doing strenuous work.  Go for a jog with one (lol yeah right) and see how far you get before ripping it off.
You see kids?  This is what happens when you skip school!
Why would you wear a mask that restricts oxygen while running?
For the last 2 weeks I've been taking paint off a bench sometimes 4 hours straight and using a face mask so I wouldn't have to breathe in all the dust and nothing has happened to me these people are just paranoid or stupid.
"When in doubt, trust a realtor"
That's why I switched to a ball gag.
Well he’s not wrong I have to work in a mask too and it’s more intensive I get out of breath when I shouldn’t
"Sucking it in and blowing it out? Where's her gym, a Bugs Bunny cartoon?"
"I know they want to get a good seat in but if you have a mask on like you should right now, not you for your sake but the sake of everyone else, you should build up quite a sweat. Sometimes I'm sweating in my mask just walking around. No work needed."
To be fair i cant imagine doing cardio with a facemask that must be so uncomfortable.
That’s the point.
"I love all these idiots out here confusing the herd immunity you get from widespread vaccination with, like, intentionally infecting yourself with a potentially deadly virus. That's not how that works, Karen."
"Karen, I'm repeatedly offended by your demands of making me wear clothes in public. It does no harm, on the contrary it helps me absorb more sunlight thus making me healthie. It's also very warm weather and not wearing clothes lessens the risk of heat stroke. As for sunburn, tan is good for you and sunlotion works great.

Wake up sheeple, give up your oppressive harnesses!"
But that's exactly what masks do. The decrease the intake of oxygen and make the carbon dioxide that is expelled to be kept for longer so over time you will be breathing a lot more carbon dioxide that usual.
"I was doing counting outside of the store I work at, keeping track of the people going in and coming out so we were within capacity, when this lady pulls up her car , rolls down her window, and says, “You know it’s a shame you have to wear those masks, I think you should be able to take them off! You need to take breaks so you can breathe!” And I was just like, “I can breathe just fine, ma’am, but thanks for your concern.”

Honestly I feel like a lot of people really oversell how hard it is to breathe in face masks. Once you get used to it, it’s not that hard at all."
Oh I suck the devil's dick in the sheets
Oxygen People are not things!
It’s hilarious that people think they are breathing their own co2 and poisoning themselves. The amount of people I’ve heard say that...I even heard it come out of a nurse’s mouth.
*Looks at altitude mask on my shelf* Should somebody tell her?
"If it had air filters, maybe"
I... don't understand
"Meanwhile I wear an N95 for 7-8 hours straight (minus my lunch) literally every day. Yeah, I'm young, not a smoker, not obese, and don't have asthma, but all these pussies complaining about it being hard to breathe with a mask really piss me off. Like, construction workers wear this shit while doing labor for several hours and you can't put a t shirt over your stupid fat face for 30 minutes so you don't give me whatever diseases you've picked up throughout your day? Fuck off. Entitled pricks."
As insane as she is. Taking your mask off after wearing it for a few hours is a wonderful feeling after doing nothing. I can't imagine working out with one on.
"I wonder if these people have never been to a fucking hospital, you know, where people have to put masks just like those for several hour shifts every week"
"I do feel that working out with a mask on isn't a good idea, though I'd just recommend not going, seeing how the gym is kinda dangerous these days anyway."
"I mean she has a point though, you shouldn't run with a mask on, you wont get enough oxygen and you'll go into oxygen debt."
"I can hear her saying ""it's oxygen people!"""
Masks should not be ditched. Physically Strenuous tasks should not be done with masks on.
there were some cases of people passing out while running with a mask on...
She does have a point though. It's hard to breathe in those things.
"All those woke karens rather getting sick with a virus that affects your whole respatory system rather than wearing a Mask. 
Because logic"
I wonder if Under Armour (one of the world's foremost sports kit manufacturer) have considered this point of Karen's?
Masks are a scam
Had no respect for under armour anyway due to their hunting range and support for hunting. They produce my country's rugby kit and I ain't buying until its made by someone else.
Well shes not technically wrong
That being said that product is the summit of stupidity. If you exercise outside you don't need that. And if you go to a gym during a pandemic then you just deserve to die
They're pushing too hard if they look like they're going to pass out.
"The [altitude simulation masks](https://www.gearhungry.com/best-training-mask/) have been a thing for quite a while. The claim, which I personally doubt, is that the resistance of the mask simulates training at altitude which has been a substance-free performance enhancer for quite some time. I’ve seen people use them at my gym but not many."
"It's actually probably not a good idea to do intense cardio with a mask. Would be better to do that kind of stuff at home if you have a treadmill, or at least run outside, instead of a gym."
to a Karen. a gym is a scouting range for her backup plan since she seems to never be able to keep a man around (and can't figure out why)
"This reminds me of the time in the gym, this guy was lying on the bench trying to get a weight off his chest and no one helped him! He tried 8 times until he finally succeeded, and two minutes later he did it again! Stay away from gyms"
"I mean I wont deny the masks make jogging and that a little more annoying especially once it gets sweaty, I dont understand this reaction towards a company trying to presumably make a mask which would prevent these issues"
[Athletes literally push their limits](https://youtu.be/MTn1v5TGK_w)
This is flat out wrong.  What you mean is that very out of shape people (you probably) feel like they will pass out after exercising.
Masks definitely make it harder to breathe when exercising.
Masks still make it hard to breathe - I certainly wouldn't want to run a marathon with a properly fitted N95 mask.
"The fact that it puffs out and gets drawn in is by design and shows that the mask is actually fairly airtight around the edges, as it should be. Nobody is claiming that wearing them is fun, but we're not doing it for fun anyway."
"Volume and porosity are too complex for them to grasp. Also, somehow the 90ish percent of people in Asia wearing masks are anaerobic."
"Let me start this off by saying that I am all about the mask usage, but last week I was doing heavy labor at work and was breathing hard. My cloth mask was slightly restrictive with getting air in--it would go taut against my lips and I wasn't able to draw air in as quickly as I wanted to. It wasn't to a point that it was a major problem. More of a discomfort/annoyance but heavy breathing in a mask sucks. Sitting at my desk or walking around grocery the store while wearing one doesn't bother me at all.

That said, I will absolutely wear mine. A little discomfort isn't worth putting other people at risk."
"Yeah it's classic absolutely classic of both parties in this country to have their followers believe contradicting ideas. ""Masks are awful, they're muzzles, they prevent you from getting enough oxygen, also the doctors that are forced to wear them for hours are a bunch of pussies for wearing them."""
"Edit: for the down voters here's a pilot study that supports my opinion: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666506920300250

Doctors have to take breaks every 3-4 hours, which under exertion reduces to 20-30 minutes.

If you're wearing a fitted or filtered mask that reduces air flow then it will cause CO2 to build up in your body. You asphyxiate and die without really feeling it. A few runners have died while wearing N95/FFP3 masks recently even though they are healthy, but it is rare.

Surgical masks are fine."
It's a hamon training mask
"It doesn’t actually work, and you take in less oxygen, which means you can’t perform at 100%."
I know the feeling.  Masks make my glasses fog up and they can be hard to breathe in.
"I go to the gym, but the masks feel impossible to breathe in when you’re getting short of breath, so I only wear them when I have to be close to somebody. We are social distanced 10 feet, so there’s that. If a company can make a mask that’s easier to use while exercising, then that’s wonderful. I don’t understand why anybody would be upset about that."
I wore a home made mask when I was on a run a couple weeks ago. It was hell.
"Serious question, how come gyms are already open there? Here in Spain most of them (I would say 90%?) are still closed -since March!"
[link](https://www.trainingmask.com/training-masks/training-mask-3-0/) I like to train with my mask on. Helps me to win more tournaments and become stronger. Different strokes for different folks.
"I work in the construction industry and my company (general contractor) requires all bodies onsite to wear masks at all time. I only have to walk the site, I can’t imagine how insufferable they are for the guys on the upper floors who are doing physical work all day without ac or for the guys out in the sun."
Its an altitude training mask im pretty sure. Its to cut your oxygen intake so your body has to work harder or something like that. Its not for corona
"Does other sarcasm bother you too, or is it just that phrase?"
"You know increasing air resistance while exercising is a common training technique for high level athletes? Its called Respiratory Muscle Training, it increases the resistance when breathing to strengthen the diaphragm. Search ""training masks"" and you can see there are lots of options. They also don't noticeably affect the amount of oxygen your body receives, you breathe harder because of the resistance but you still breathe.. its not like less oxygen gets through the mask

I think this is a smart product, maybe you're not the target audience but to act like its a bad idea is just ignorant.

"I was thinking the same thing!  LoL I have been running with a cloth mask, and this one might feel a little better.

Pushing hard is how you make progress.
"I would respectfully disagree. I’m not young and I work out to the point of being seriously out of breath. Do it regularly and running seems easy. I wouldn’t recommend it to someone who *hasn't* been working out, but the benefits of training hard are amazing."
You can definitely look like you're going to pass out without actually being on the verge of passing out
"For running i think it works tbh, i’m always struggling the last 10 minutes and it looks ridiculous but it works"
STOP WATCHING ME POOP!
That's probably a bit of an exaggeration. I'm always a bit short of breath if I'm doing any serious cardio.
Yea although don't confuse it with exhaustion. I breath heavily if it's a hard workout
"No pain, no gain. Simple as that. If you're not breaking a sweat, and pushing your limits why are you even wasting space at the gym?"

How about a real link that educates people https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141023210016-152086582-3-reasons-not-to-wear-a-mma-altitude-training-mask
They don’t make your cardiorespiratory system any more efficient because they don’t affect the partial pressure of oxygen in a way that simulates altitude. They simply make your diaphragm work harder.
"Those don't work.

The point of altitude training is use the lower partial pressure of oxygen in the air to make your body produce erythropoietin to make more red blood cells.

This requires lower oxygen levels.

A mask just makes you breathe harder, but your blood will still get enough oxygen. 

It doesn't even remotely cause lower blood oxygenation, and even if you inhibit your breathing enough to cause those lower levels, you'll have a very hard time removing CO2, which will make you feel like you are suffocating.

(This is not relavnt for regular face masks, they don't cause significant changes in CO2 rebreathing).


At altitude however you'll easily breathe off the CO2, so no feeling of suffocation.

All it does is make you feel fatigue faster until your blood keeps up.



So yes, all such a mask does is make your diaphragm work harder to inhale and exhale.

This might give a tiny advantage for high breathing volume requiring situations, but apart from that it does nothing to your blood at safe breathing resistance."
Idk depends what kind of exercise we are talking about.  After mountain biking I lay down in my car basically can’t move. If I had to wear a mask I would 100% throw up 3/4 through the trail and then have the shakes the rest of the way home.
"Cloth masks are much easier to breathe in than N95 masks, they're more about catching the crap you breathe out than filtering anything."
Hell I work in a large restaurant with multiple floors. I  wanna pass out every time I have to run upstairs for a side of ranch.
"Yeah... while I bear through it because I want to do my civic duty, wearing masks really fucks me up. After about 45min to an hour I'm struggling to breathe. It feels like I'm only breathing in my own carbon dioxide Ann's getting no oxygen anymore. I just take really big gasping breaths till I can get somewhere alone to take it off for a few minutes and put it back on. I just try not to go out much."
Whoever said n95 mask you sperg?
A lot of people complain that it's hard to breathe in cloth or loose surgical masks. A lot of people seem to disregard the fact that difficulty breathing and shallowness of breath are some of the more mild covid symptoms.
"“When we exhale, the composition of the air remains almost same as the air we inhale, only the percentage of carbon dioxide and oxygen changes. The amount of inhaled air contains 
21% of oxygen and 0.04% of carbon dioxide, while the air we breathe out contains 16.4% of oxygen and 4.4% of carbon dioxide.”

Since it seemed you were a bit confused, we don’t exhale pure CO2 lol."
Yes... There is no room in the mask for it... You dont magically amass a ton of CO2 in the mask... It is porous...
You might be confusing CO2 and CO.
*Niiiiiice*
Is that a motherfucking Jojo reference?
"... which this low oxygen activates genes that produce more red blood cells so you can collect more oxygen. 

It is something people do when they are trying to boost their red cell count or acclimate to a higher altitude before actually going. 

Also. If I put weight on the barbell, I can no longer perform at 100% either, but making training harder is kind of necessary if you want to get stronger or more fit."
They sort of work for training at high altitudes. They do replicate the difficulties breathing and developed your diaphragm and the feeling of not getting enough air. They don’t recreate lower pressure that you experience at high altitude.
"What? This is not true, respiratory muscle training is known to work, it strengthens the diaphragm but makes no noticeable change to the amount of oxygen transport.

So if you mean ""they don't work to create a low oxygen (hypoxic) environment"" then yea they aren't the same as high altitude training, but they have been shown to improve VO2 max"
"Is there any good solution to this with a cloth face mask? I have tried soaping the lenses, stuffing tissues on either side of my nose, and using a bent paper clip to conform the mask around my nose better, but these solutions do not last long, and I am often fogging up by the time I reach the grocery store."
Social distancing 10 feet won't really help that much being inside a place with recycled air conditioning.  There were studies of people being infected much further away just because of how AC gets recycled inside.
"Because nothin, not even a deadly virus is gunna hold back an american from doing what they want."
If you don’t show symptoms you don’t transfer it. It’s simple
It's actually the implied condescension.
Huh.  Had no idea this was a thing.  TIL

How does the taste of having your own foot in your mouth feel like, snowflake"
Most of the masks being worn right now don't. They are just to minimize the distance droplets from your nose and mouth travel.
"I don’t think any mask that is actually doing it’s job is pleasant to exercise in. I used a few cloth ones or gaiters at first. Recently picked up the Zensah mask for running.  It doesn’t get as funky, but still unpleasant for longer than a few minutes. So I’m only putting it on when I’m passing close by people."

I'm not claiming that you should ditch the mask, just if you can, running without its better. I run and trying to do it with a mask makes you feel like you are about to blackout."
"The dumbest assumption you made is that the government cares about you at all. This already disqualifies you from any meaningful conversation. 

Mask manufacturers write it on the box that the mask will not prevent you from getting a virus. The virus particle is infinitely smaller than the pores in the mask."
Why would you need a mask to run outside?
Then don't jog that far. Start off by alternating walking and running.
I only run if I'm being chased by something more deadly than myself.
"Well, that’s a big jump from 5 feet per week."
Stay in the couch. Listen to your body.
"Yeah like, I’m not a big fan of exercise (the fibromyalgia makes it hard) but that’s still my mindset too. Like, if it doesn’t permanently injure you and doesn’t kill you, you didn’t push too hard."
When did I say it didn't.
"youre literally killing yourself by doing that, dont cry when you give yourself a heart attack"
There's a difference between training hard to the point of being short on breath at the end and pushing so hard that you start to get dizzy and it's legitimately difficult to breathe.
Talk about an exaggeration! Bit short of breath does not look like someone's about to pass out.

Seen a few people at my gym using them too (before Corona) - what benefits do they actually have?
I totally disagree with you but I've been wearing N95 at work for a bit now since I work with particulates.
My buddy worked at the Charter House in Boston for about 2 years. Ruined his knees doing that shit.
"While I didn't know the exact percentages of CO2 to O2, I knew that our exhaled breaths was pure CO2. My confusion was just a mix me not understanding the other poster's point combined with a hangover."
"But you still think it is somewhat harder to breath through a mask, right? I’m not saying don’t wear them in public, definitely do, but to say it’s just as easy to breath with a mask as it is without is just a lie."
"You do in fact rebreathe, though. And under exertion, your body produces a significantly higher volume of CO2. With a properly made mask, you would not have sufficient airflow for heavy exercise. 

The mask fabric itself holds on to gases, and you  might be surprised at how much the amount of gas in the mask matters. And properly made masks are woven out of a rather tight weave of cotton for the express purposes of being less porous, or they’re not as effective. So if you can comfortably do hard exercise in your mask, it’s probably not worth much. 

There are masks made for this purpose, mostly sold as cycling masks, with multiple filtered airflow valves. They’re intended for cyclists in high-pollution environments."
"No, it's carbon dioxide toxicity (hypercapnia). Here's a very small study that shows some results indicating it can be a problem: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666506920300250

It is rare that it causes major problems, but exercise makes it happen faster, and if gyms start recommending it then it may become a problem that needs to be addressed.

CO comes from unburned gas."
This isn’t true please stop repeating broscience nonsense.
"I'm still not sure I get this product. Can you change gene activation by receiving slightly less air when working out?

Unfortunately it is proven that the only way to experience this is to train at higher altitude because the oxygen ratio doesn't change with the mask.
"It’s all a placebo, so if it works for you then that’s great. Like I said it’s all ready debunked and proven to not work as intended. The only reason why they even got popular was because Marshawn Lynch wore one during  a pre-game practice. You can look that up too if you don’t believe me."
"I recently bought an anti fog spray online. It was $15 and smaller than an eyedrop bottle. I haven't tried it yet, but it was recommended by a few people."
Yea it's deffinatly important but if I can't breath proporly I get anxious especially if it's after a run. I had bad athsma as a kid and I haven't carried an inhaler for years so if it gets hard to breath I start panicking inside
This is the correct answer. Also we are already seeing another surge.

"Well the person in the screenshot called Face masks muzzles, so she might not be the most accurate source on what that person stepping off the treadmill looked like..."
I believe the idea is that you condition your body to perform under conditions where you get less oxygen. So the mask attempts to simulate high altitude conditions at sea level. The evidence for them isn’t great though.
See my above comment. These masks do nothing because they don’t affect the partial pressure of oxygen.
"Supposedly the mask simulates the environment of high altitudes, where the air contains less oxygen. When you have to perform in a lower altitude your muscles receive more oxygen than usual, and that is suppossed to boost your conditioning."
strengthen your diaphragm.
"Basically it makes it harder by stimulating the reduced oxygen of a higher altitude, so when you are running without it, you have a breathing advantage."
How was your experience of it?
"Thank you for being one of the few reasonable people it seems we have now days. There is a guy in my neighborhood who had a confirmed case and refused to wear a mask before and after recovery.

"I like your comment, and you’re absolutely right, but am I the only one who absolutely hates comments that start with “ding ding ding”. Idk why, it just irks me."
I work in a hospital and can absolutely attest that running around the hospital is much harder now having to wear a mask all the time. I have no idea while people are disagreeing with you.
"\- I have asthma and i have no issues.

\- No one is forcing N95 grade masks  

\- I never said it is ""as easy as without"" - Non N95 cloth masks have almost no draw resitance 

\- Just put the god damn mask on in public"
"What is untrue about it? I can academically defend my assertion if you’d like, but I need to know what you think my assertion is first so I understand that you know how complicated this subject is."
"Well. It is more an environmental response. You have to be in a low oxygen environment for a while.


All your body is trying to do is keep enough RBC to keep up with your oxygen demands. Start working out, then your body makes more RBC to compensate that increased oxygen use. Decreasing the amount of oxygen you are getting by limiting it artificially or going to a higher altitude will do the same thing.

But it goes the other way, too. 

If you only wear your mask for the workout and take it off after, you’ll still be in that rich oxygen environment and your RBC count will want to go back to the equilibrium for that environment. 

So basically, don’t get the mask. It can work, but only in specific uses. Most people I know that get it only have it for the challenge.

Just don’t expect to become a superhero with a permanently increased RBC. It will come back down to the most efficient equilibrium every time."
"or exclusively breathing though nose, won't work as well but still reduce air taken in."
"I'm in this thread looking for this. I was once considering a training mask, but so many different sources simply said it doesn't work. 

Mask for Covid-19 = reasonable. 

Mask for workout = waste of money. (So it would seem)"
"I encourage you to read my long reply. 

You guys are overreaching my assertion and assuming I’m claiming the same thing magazines do. 

This is something I studied my entire last semester of undergrad to disprove a broscience dude in my group. It was an Animal Physio project and our group was doing the effect of breathing techniques on muscle endurance."
"I encourage you to read my other replies as you are also overreaching my assertion. 

I have studied this. One of my senior projects in undergrad was studying the effects of breathing techniques on muscle endurance. This subject came up a LOT in the supplementary research for the intro."

Now it probably is way more popular than it should be because of Marshawn Lynch and the propensity for exercise gimmicks.. but it does do something, definitely doesn't simulate high altitude training because it doesn't change oxygen levels but it does train respiratory muscles. But you're right that there have been studies saying it does nothing, heres an article on why the studies seem to waffle back and forth

https://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954-6111(05)00381-1/fulltext

But yeah its right on the line of working and placebo and very difficult to properly test, but I wouldn't say its definitively debunked.

Also I'll say I definitely don't use it, I'm not a competitive athlete and I really don't think I'm at the level for it to do anything for me... I'm better off just exercising more like most people"
The WHO came out and said it last week. Don’t be such a scared sheep
"After all, we are talking about increasing density."
"I just said you should run with a mask if you have to, but its harder, lol. If you can safely run without one its a better idea. Any runner knows if you are using more oxygen than you are getting you will go into anaerobic respiration, and become sore. I'm not trying to argue with you, just pointing out that running with a mask isn't great."
That's not how any of this works
Just go running outside dummy
"Honestly, y'all gave better workout advice for free than any gym trainer I've ever had, all of them tried to get me to buy the premium membership because it ""encourages you to workout more"""
Lots of running groups use the run/walk method.   It’s a great way to ramp up your cardio in a supportive group.
"When it comes to exercise, the only person you're trying to beat is who you were yesterday."
I'm probably more deadly than a toddler.. depends on their Lego scattering ability.
"As far as I know the key is that they dont actually simulate high altitudes because they dont lower the amount of oxygen you're breathing in (the same air gets through) but they increase the resistance which is supposed to strengthen respiratory muscles.

There's no evidence that they match high altitude training as far as oxygen transport or hemoglobin/hematocrit levels however there's good evidence that they increase VO2 max and power output"
Supposedly not  https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141023210016-152086582-3-reasons-not-to-wear-a-mma-altitude-training-mask
"Because one of the ways the body can adapt is by producing more red blood cells and hemoglobin to carry the available oxygen. The idea is that then when you're at lower altitude and oxygen is more plentiful, you get a higher VO2 max than you would had you not done the altitude training. 

It seems to mainly help with endurance athletics."
99% wrong. See my above comment.
"As a smoker, I figured my cough was just worse than normal.

Then came the tingling. It attacks your circulatory system. It reduces oxygen to everything, but it's so slow you don't even notice. Fingers and toes going numb, couldn't properly move my leg.

Then came the delirium. I naturally run cold, so everybody said I didn't have a fever. No sleep, horrible nightmares, and the anxiety of ""This has given people my age strokes."" 

Digestive problems as well. Every morning, both ends. After three weeks, I can finally feel my arms and legs properly.

You seriously do not want to catch this. The people going out and pretending they're invincible are so stupid."
"It's okay, I get it <3"
"The only time I have an issue with the mask is when work gets super hot and I start sweating, feels like I'm wearing a wet wash cloth on my face. That being said my workplace isn't very densely populated so when people are nowhere to be seen I slide it down for a moment of reprieve. Up it goes when someone starts walking my direction."
"Because they're on a team. If you're pro mask, masks can do no wrong. If you're anti mask, masks fan do no right.

Somehow **masks** have become political."
"I never said that you said that, just posed the question to get your opinion. I also said wear it in public. No need to get pissy"
"A lot of sources say it doesn't work and a lot say it does, here's one article that tries to explain why there's so much discrepancy

https://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954-6111(05)00381-1/fulltext

I dont think theyre the best choice for your average athlete but theres at least enough evidence to say it might possibly give an edge. If you're looking to simulate a hypoxic environment and get high altitude training at sea level then youre going to be disappointed because they dont lower O2 levels, but if you go into it from the respiratory muscle training side then there's potentially a benefit"
"Yeah I was in the same boat. I asked my weight training instructor about it, and he said it was all bogus, but if I wanted to look like Bane then go for it lol."
"If you’re going to be at high altitude in two weeks, wearing the mask for ~12 hours a day the week before can help you pre acclimate before going. 

If you’re doing it for training, it can be a novel and fun experience. 

If you’re doing it to stop the spread of the disease , good job. 


If you’re trying to permanently increase your RBC or become super strong, this product is not right for you."
"No, it's ineffective full stop. Your 3 month undergrad study isn't worth anything."
"Oh, so you're one of those people.

If you go to the source you'll see that the WHO said they believe asymptomatic spread is *rare*. But the CDC is estimating that 30% of cases are spread by *pre*symptomatic individuals who are sick but not seeing symptoms yet.

Wearing a mask, worst case scenario I waste my time. Best case I prevent giving someone a potentially fatal disease.

Not wearing a mask, worst case I end up spreading an infection to someone because I just want to be a selfish asshole.

The choice is pretty simple if you care even the slightest bit about someone other than yourself"
"That's not what they said actually. There's a difference between being asymptomatic and presymptomatic. You can not show symptoms and be PREsymptomatic and still spread the virus. All the WHO said was that asymptomatic spread was not really possible (meaning carrier spread as opposed to spreading it before you show symptoms when you are going to get sick).

I thought the same thing as you when I first read the article from WHO, but being asymptomatic doesn't actually mean what we think it means."
"No, they didnt."
Yo I cant! Running is something the metal in my body prevents me from doing. Dummy.
"Progressive overload is incredibly simple, but incredibly effective."
How does that work?  Is overpaying for your gym membership supposed to guilt you into working out more?
"The real advantage to a trainer isn't what they know, it's having the constant motivator beside you pushing you on."
"Your not going to improve as fast if you dont push your self. Its what builds your stamina. Take it from a seasoned athlete, you feel so good after working your ass off and you get home and you can look at yourself and the mirror and see that you improved."
Well said
Masks don’t do this. They are 99% useless.
Thank you for sharing your experience. It’s too bad that wearing a mask has become so political that people are willing to risk this to prove a point.
"Damn, that does sound awful—good on you for powering through it."
how's your lung capacity ? Are you worried about future health issues ?
"Considering this topic only came up in the intro, dispelling its effectiveness for the way it is commonly used, okay? 

Your arguments are also ineffective because you actually aren’t arguing against me or my assertions. You are arguing against a straw man that you think is my position."
Oh shucks. I guess I’ll go lock myself in my room a couple more months...
"We weren't talking about you sweetie! This post is about athletes and a company making masks for them, that has nothing to do with you! Not everything revolves around your little person!"
plus you feel silly and its fun as hell doing reps with just a bar to failiure
"I think it was supposed to make you think that since you bought it, you have to use it"
"You don't need to improve fast when you're someone who just wants to get in better shape, but advice like yours makes them give up fast"
Shut up.
"Like buckets of weasels, they're unpredictable."
Sorry I was referring to actual altitude training. High altitude does that.
"How people can think it's political is just ruining me. I get weird looks for wearing a mask, and it's like... people, it's for YOU. I'm wearing it so YOU don't get it.

Ugh."
"It was rough, and I just wish people would take it seriously."
"You know the reports of feeling a plate on your chest? I had that, and it was the weirdest feeling. Now that it's 'done', I don't feel it as often... but it still comes up.

Definitely worried that there's permanent damage."
"I already provided studies in my original comment, you are just too lazy to click and read."
"The data says you can get similar results if you work the muscle to failure, regardless of the weight on the bar.... So yeah."
Hah! I once paid for a gym membership for a whole year without going once.
At the same time though if you're not pushing yourself you're never really getting better are you?
My former boss tried to convince me to take my mask off saying “it doesn’t even help you. It only helps other people”. So I said “I know. That’s why I wear it”.
"i meant working to failure with normal weight, dropping weight,working to failure again, etc, until its just the bar and you can barely lift it."
"w. a. h

huh? How can people be so oblivious."
Comment
"The movement (funny its called that) is so wrong, as an outsider I just see it exactly how you do, an excuse for unhealthy obese ladies to encourage eachother for getting to said unhealthy obesity?

 It's fucked right up and doesn't hold space/value for people to discuss skin issues/scars disfigurements."
"It should be for people to accept their natural imperfections and not to justify poor self-care decisions.

I know that's what you said but you used too many words"
"I used to get really angry about this too. But I started thinking, maybe it's good for overweight people to learn to love their bodies and in conclusion taking care of them by loosing weight. It shouldn't be a place for obese people to justify their unhealthy lifestyle. All I'm saying is, loosing weight probably works better and more consistently if you do it based on a positive mindset and not because you hate your body."
The sad thing is it’s really twisting people’s minds and making them think it’s healthy. I don’t care if this offends people but being obese is really unhealthy and people shouldn’t be proud of it.
This post has become a weekly tradition here on this sub it seems
I think both should recieve support - life is too short to be down about yourself whether it's 'self inflicted' or not - but I do agree that there should be a distinction between body positivity and body complacency - an overweight person shouldn't feel like a failure or be depressed because they're overweight but they also should be actively trying to lose weight for the health benefits instead of justifying it
"Generally agree to this; the movement is too focused on larger woman when it should be much broader....but after seeing your responses to other comments, I've got to say you just sound bitter."
"I think you missed the point. It's not obese people telling themselves it's ok to eat cake and be unhealthy. It's telling themselves and others that it's not ok to shame people for their health and mental issues. They know their obese, and that it's not healthy. They know they should change they're lifestyle to be healthier. They just want to stop others from shaming them, and stop themselves from bring to hard on themselves."
"You should probably be aware that the body positivity movement is an offshoot of the fat acceptance movement, not the other way around as you are putting it. If anyone had a right to be upset at their movement being hijacked it would be the fat people who are seeing people like you taking the body positivity movement that they created and somehow trying to imply that they have no right to be a part of it.

You are trying to gatekeep them out of their own movement. It started with fat people saying they should be happy in their bodies and then those self same fat people decided that in fact the movement was bigger than that and that everyone, regardless of their size, shape or whatever else should be happy in their own bodies. If fat people being happy in their bodies makes you feel less happy in yours then I'm sorry but the problem lies with you, not with them."
"What I dont understand, is why people need to have an opinion on the bodies, lives, choices of other people just minding their own business. Most people are just trying to get through the day, if theyre fat, skinny, disabled, able bodied, gay, straight or anything in between.

A select few push things in the faces of others, but for the most part people are unwilling subjects to you and your opinion on them and what's wrong with them and their lives/life choices. 90% of them didn't ask for you to pass judgement on them, they didn't shove it in your face, they just existed living a life as they themselves wish to live it. Your opinion isn't needed, nor wanted.

People shit on overweight people. There are a huge range of reasons why people are overweight, which sometimes have fuck all to do with cake, but the go-to attack is lack of self control. They don't owe you an explanation as to why they're fat. Maybe the have PCOS, maybe they have a thyroid problem, maybe they suffer from depression and take medication that, despite how much they exercise and diet, leaves them bloated and overweight. Should they not be allowed to accept their bodies and find some peace? Why do you get to decide that they should be ashamed? Shall we make them wear signs so we know who's fat just because cake, and who's fat for 'valid reasons'?

The same goes for most things in life. If its got nothing to do with you, fuck off. Don't make fun of the girl with cystic fibrosis. Don't bully the lesbian. Don't exclude the fat girl. Don't pass judgement on the guy with depression. The list goes on. God forbid any of these people try to live their lives and accept themselves for who they are. Maybe they should go and eat some cake, and hang themselves. 

Honestly, this is one massive circle shit. Let's just shit on everybody so that we all feel shit. Because making someone else feel shit makes me feel good for 5 minutes. 

I'll probably get massively downvoted for this, but I'm over seeing this same 'unpopular opinion' 103474 times a week."
"I’ve seen BP stuff around scars and many other things, maybe you’re right that it has more focus on weight compared to other important elements, but that doesn’t mean it’s wrong for weight to be a part of it. 

Also, weight isn’t all one thing or another. People often seem to go one way or another in their views on it and that’s too simplified. I know fat people ranging across the spectrum, from someone who has an Addison’s-like disease where the high-dose steroid treatment has a huge impact, through to people who just eat crap and don’t care, with most situations being in the middle (e.g. antidepressants amping up hunger but not directly affecting your body mass in the way that steroids do). There’s loads of comments that make out fatness is all a choice (and then you get people respond in situations like this that imply every fat person has Addison’s or something) but there’s hella shades of grey in between. 

But bottom line, I don’t think presenting body positivity as only conditional, based on “validity” of how a person came to have a stigmatised body, is good for anyone. Shoe on the other foot, do you want everyone to  insist they need to know how you became scarred to decide if your scars make you “ugly” or not? That kind of conditional acceptance is not liberating, even for those who are considered “valid” in such judgements."
"This gets posted weekly here, and is hugely popular."
"Drastically unpopular opinion on reddit, the site that brought the world /r/fatpeoplehate"
"There are a lot of women who show disability and skin complaints. Maybe, you just haven't found the right accounts yet. I think it is unfair to call them 'vain fat' women. It takes a lot to go on social media and show yourself as being anything other that what the majority of people consider attractive."
"Saying it's used by the ""wrong"" people is wrong.
Obese and overweight people need this movement just like everyone else. You think it's easy to lose weight when your only motivation is hating yourself? You think that the right way to make good health-related choices is by getting your motivation fueled by insults and stares?
Everybody need this movement, nobody should be excluded or else you'd me a hypocrite: why would you say ""love yourself the way it is"" if you criticise overweight people?

The majority of obese and overweight people are aware of their condition but losing weight is extremely hard when nobody seems to support you and accept you but food itself. Please think about it."
"Hi, as a fat girl (I'm 4'10 and was sheltered indoors AND discouraged from playing due to an abusive dad and have had depression that causes me to have spastic eating habits) I have stretchmarks and scarring, and honestly while I empathize with you, we're just as much ""vain"" as you are (we want to feel good about ourselves in spite of what we can/cannot control, and know we're beautiful always as human beings). No matter what I can do about my stretch marks, I can never get rid of them. And some people have weight for reasons you may not know of, like childhood trauma, or other psychological/personal issues, or even eating disorders/body dysmorphia.  If someone wants to lose wieght, it should be for their own well-being, but by using language like claiming that girls need an ""excuse"" to not be fat, well, that demonstrates precisely why fat girls (and fat boys, and fat women, fat men, and fat people of whatever gender or age group) should be included.

TL;DR, your frustration is valid, but suggesting the body positive movement should gatekeep or invalidate people with body wieght differences isn't."
"This has been posted before, so I'll just copy and paste a comment I wrote below that:

&#x200B;

 

>This post comes from someone who probably has no idea of what body positivity and fat acceptance mean. I support those movements, however, I condemn extremism and whoever twists their definition for their own agenda.  
>  
>Obesity **is unhealthy**, it doesn't matter how much you workout, or how ""clean"" you eat. If you eat too much to the point where you're medically classified as ""obese"", you are still exposing your body to various diseases linked to such lifestyle.  
>  
>The reason why fat acceptance is needed, is because fat people still deserve to be treated like human beings, not monsters to be afraid/ashamed of, not strange creatures for you to mock or denigrate.  
>  
>I used to be obese, and my weight loss journey came from self-love, not hatred. I didn't change because I hated myself, and as a matter of fact, that one time I did it out of hatred, it lead me to eating disorders. When I actually started to accept my body and my image, I started to have fun and wear nice clothes, see myself differently, and doing so I realised that being fat doesn't mean you can't wear swimsuits, or go dancing because otherwise people will see your fat rolls.  
>  
>Only then I automatically stopped eating so much; it didn't even feel like a diet, I was so happy with myself I didn't need to drown my emotions in food.

So, fat people still deserve to be part of this movement. Body positivity means, by definition: ""***Body positivity*** *is the idea that people should feel happy with and proud of their body, whatever shape or size it is.""*

Now, it is true that extremists are always louder, so it's not uncommon to see fat people bragging about their weight and feeling like they don't actually need to lose it, but that shouldn't affect the definition of the movement itself.

Stop focusing so much on others and letting movements define your worth. Do you want to feel good about yourself? You don't need to find a category to fit in. You don't need to be part of any movement to find love and acceptance within yourself. Focus on your body."
"Like I hate my body, and it's not because I'm fat (I've been working on it recently and tbh I'm doing good) but I like have very unusual amounts of body hair on me... Everywhere and it's super embarrassing because I'm only 15 and have more body hair than any man in my family plus more ever since I was 12, and I've tried to do something about it to make myself feel better but it only gets worse. Tbh I feel bad if I say I need body positivity or be part of the body positivity movement because hair is natural but still."
"Counter opinion. 

I can understand this thought process. However, I have grown to change it.

Some are large by choice. Or by making poor choices. Sure. I can agree. But thinking about the why and learning has shifted my perspective. 


As being someone with body dysmorphia, I'd think you could relate. A lot of the times people start overeating  because they are unhappy. They then develop this hatred of what they become. So they keep eating. Because they are sad. So they're stuck in a loop. 

"" they could go on a diet, I cant get rid of my scars.""

True. But when you eat food that's for sustenance. When someone in that cycle, that meal MAY be the ONLY dopamine hit they get all day. It can be similar to a drug addiction. You wake up hating yourself you eat a big breakfast because you're already sad etc etc.

The worst part of it, they HAVE to take that drug. Every day. Now think about the world we live in with ads and street food carts etc. It's like having Heroin advertisements, open cooking kitchens, commercials screaming at you to shoot up. 

Part of body positivity is to help you take back control. To learn to love yourself first. To not let the high of eating control you. 

A larger person with bad mental health is two bad things. A large person with good mental health is, if nothing else, a win. One less person suffering in mental anguish is a good thing. So I'll take that. 

But it shouldnt end there. It should encourage people to continue taking agency of their life and lose the weight."
"The way I look at it; don't shame people because of their body, whether they have a health condition or simply ""like cake"", there is no reasonable justification for body shaming. Some might argue that it's a health-focused intervention i.e. pointing out that somebody is overweight and that it is unhealthy. Look, fat people are perfectly aware that they are overweight and body shaming them is never going to encourage them to lose weight, if anything it will reinforce emotional insecurities that often cause people to overeat in the first place."
"It IS a place for those girls too though. There are unfortunately going to be vain, unpleasant people in any positivity movement. 

But the point of it is to let everyone feel comfortable in their bodies. I’m a fat girl. I know I’m fat. I struggle to lose weight but never really put any on beyond my current size. I struggle enough with my own body dysmorphia issues without being told I don’t deserve to feel good about my body just because I’m fat. Or have it based on he assumption I like cake and must gorge myself. 

My weight issues are a combination of physical health problems and mental health problems as well as being literally starved by my dad’s girlfriend when she got custody of me after his death. It gave me a difficult relationship with food that I am still working on as an adult. 

You deserve to feel good about your body. I deserve to feel good about my body. Everyone does regardless of their shape, size, physical conditions ect. 

Yes, even obese people. When you love yourself it is easier to better yourself. Constantly putting obese folks down, insulting them ect is detrimental to their attempts at weight loss. That’s a fact. 

We can all build each other up without tearing others down."
"Actually the movement is both, and maybe if you didn’t find the need to refer to fat girls as ‘girls who like cake’ you’d be able to find your place easier."
"I partially agree, although not completely. There are def people making entire careers out of saying that you can be healthy at 600 pounds and if your doctor says your knees are exploding she's just a pro-anna monster. Those people are either grape brained or grifters, likely both. 

At the same time, I do think that the physicality focus of obesity discussions doesn't help. Telling someone who copes with food they're hideous isn't gonna help. And it's gone a little too far. My sister developed a little faster than her peers so by 8th grade she wore a D cup bra. Even though she wore size 4 jeans and was in great shape, ran around constantly and won field days every year. But she was labelled ""obese"" because she hit puberty like an anime girl. After that, she got super depressed and started wearing giant clothes to hide her body, and stopped playing around and actually gained weight (over 100 pounds) because she was told she was fat. If the body positive movement had been around then maybe she'd have understood BMI is kind of a flawed generality and she was perfectly fine. 

It's good to tell people not to attack people based on weight alone, even if they are very obese. It's bad to pretend that the human body can live like that. Someone with self harm scars did it to themselves but still deserves positivity, arguably someone with pregnancy stretch marks did it to themselves but still deserves positivity. The movement is largely overshadowed by grifters but the solution isn't to be gatekeepers it's to just call those people out for being grifters."
"> if anyone needs support its the girl with cystic fibrosis, not the girl who likes cake 

We can support both of them though. There's no reason to hate people for being overweight, and many people do. There's no reason to feel bad about being fat. Lose weight and improve your health if you want to, but don't hate people for choosing cake.

Body positivity is about not hating yourself. What you're saying is it's okay to hate fat people. But nobody thinks it's okay to hate people with scars.

So who needs this movement more..?"
"I also saw the movement as a way to help the epidemic of young girls with eating disorders. Having a little more body fat than the skinniest model is okay. That the most important thing is a balanced healthy diet and a good amount of exercise. After that, love your body for what it is. That's what it should really be."
"I agree with what you said. However, in response to a lot of replies, here:
You can be slightly overweight, and still have excellent cardiovascular health, and still have a balanced diet (albeit in excess)"
"To me body positivity is being confident now matter how you look, and then there’s having a healthy body (not obese). I think people mix these up. 

Lizzo for example, great example of the prior not latter. 

Just my two pennies worth 

I’m obese before anyone says anything."
It sounds like you’re trying to find a body positive community that doesn’t accept fat people? Can you see why you’re having a hard time being accepted?
"How many times do we need to see this ""unpopular opinion"" on this sub?"
The girl from Tinder who is 80 lbs heavier than her picture and expects you to pay for her when she eats and drinks enough for two people
Yeah I got downvoted for saying being fat will make you die early
Why can’t just everybody feel good with their bodies? The weight of other people is none of my business!
"YES! Thank you. As someone with one of the top excuses I see for people to complain about their weight, thank you. I have Hypothyroidism.


Hypothyroidism can cause some weight gain. Especially undiagnosed or untreated. I went about two years feeling like garbage, particularly one year when my levels were so low I didn't have any function at all. I gained 30 pounds and swelled up like crazy. Tired all the time, like bone tired, not able to function.   Went to my doctor, requested a blood test. Oh, look! You have no thyroid. Let's fix it. Fast forward to now, my levels are great. I feel human again. But every single day I see these people talking about their thyroid condition and why they're morbidly obese. 

Switched up my food and workout habits, and I'm down 30 pounds. I'm about 15 from my goal weight and HELL YES it's harder with a thyroid issue. I'm on week three of a plateau but that isn't an excuse to eat garbage. If anything my issue is a reason to not only watch what I eat but to do so for the rest of my life so I FEEL my best and my health is it's best. 

 I always see these folks talking about their Hypothyroidism and eating like crap.  Here's the thing, if it was your thyroid you wouldn't be eating that way. Eating trash only makes Hypothyroidism worse -- I lay off dairy completely due to an allergy, but most of us with Hypothyroidism need to also watch gluten intake as well.  Especially if they have Hashimoto's.  You feel twenty times better when you eat pretty damn close to Paleo. My main dishes at home are some variant of lean protein, veggies and carbs. You even have to watch what vegetables you eat. It's a fun mine field of ""what's going to make me bloat today"". 

Weight loss is possible with""invisible"" issues like Hypothyroidism. I did it and am doing it. It does suck, but you have to take personal responsibility for your own actions and understand how to not fight your body, but nourish it and work with it. Definitely be patient with it.  I have to work hard to maintain what I'm at and I'm not entirely happy with that, but it's a hell of a lot better than where I was. I do yoga in the mornings and go to the gym at night 4-6 days a week. You do have to work a bit harder to maintain, especially if you have a cheat meal or drink.  

Body positivity has taken personal responsibility out of the equation and I hate it."
"It's sad. The name itself lends itself to acceptance and inclusion of those who cannot help their deformities and fat people who want to lose weight or have thyroid issues. Instead it got hijacked and turned into ""fat is fabulous, fuck everything and everyone else. Who cares about having a healthy body""

Being fat or obese is not something that should be demonized but it shouldn't be celebrated either."
I see it as an excuse for fat people to keep being fat.
"Ah shit, there we go again.
I train six days per week (running, cardio and lifting). I'm vegetarian, I cannot eat sugar. I have diet from dietitian. So looking from outside you cannot tell that I don't have physical activity or eat unhealthy.
And I'm blob of fat. I'm almost overweight.
I'm bulimic. When I have binge, I eat whatever I have in my fridge. Then I purge until there is nothing beside blood.
Yes, this is not a mortal disease, it is an addiction and my bad choices, I'm like a druggie or alcoholic, I aware how pathetic I am.
Body positive movement is giving me hope and encouraging me to step out from my house, to meet my friends, to feel somehow worthy, because I have this narrative in my mind, that I don't deserve friendship, love or social love because of my disgusting weight.
So don't be so harsh. It is a long process to lose weight and it is good to know that in a phase of your biggest weight no one got right to shame you, mock you, hate you. It is a phase. Our weight fluctuate through our whole life and this not what matters the most."
"The movement itself should be about body characteristics you can’t change, cuz if you can change something and you don’t do it, then you’re just lazy. 


I know, there could be people who’re fat because they have a disease and they should embrace themselves too, but for those who just eat shit and then say that they’re „body positive“ then they‘re a whore or a son of a bitch."
"You're completely right, I can't stand the body positive movement for the reason that skinny people are getting a lot of shit from them. You can help being fat but you can't necessarily help being skinny. Everyone should have body positivity and fat people are really not helping the movement."
Facts. Body positivity movement should be led by acid survivors and people with scars. Way too many people are using it as an excuse for their laziness.
"I agree with your point but this isnt really an unpopular opinion, especially when you consider the demographic of those who use reddit."
"While I do see the movement as very unhealthy and exclusive, I would say you're doing exactly what they're doing. Saying someone else's problems are not valid. It's really no better. Everyone should have access to good medical and psychological care regardless of the reason. The body positivity movement should be for everyone with any insecurity or flaw. Binge eating is also an eating disorder/addiction. A medical issue, just like cystic fibrosis. This isn't an unpopular opinion but you're definitley being a massive hypocrite."
"My biggest issue with this is that most of the conditions you guytalk about can't be controlled by you it just happened you got the short end of the stick. But the obese people chose not to watch their diets, exercise, or be mindful of their weight. They made that choice so we should have every right to judge them. They have no place in this movement"
"Counterpoint: I was fat in high school and the stress of being treated like a subhuman (getting punched/physically harassed nearly daily, daily insults, etc.,)  because of that actually kinda was a problem. I left school and lost 70 pounds, and never noticed until someone that knew me called bullshit when they asked my weight and I replied with my high school weight.

Reddit really fucking hates fat people, I get it, but being upset that they aren't actively hating themselves when I guarantee a lot of other people are doing that job for them already is a bit on the cruel side."
"Being fat isn’t the same as something which you have to live with w/o control over it. Scaring, damaging bones etc. aren’t a choice and it’s something that will live with u till u die. It’s part of u , so celebrate it. But being fat? It’s a choice. I’m not saying you should be shamed but you aren’t the centre of this movement or even a part of it. Because it’s to bring people with actual physical abnormalities up. Yes sometimes being fat is not controllable such as disorders or genetic reasons. And that’s when them and their bodies should be cherished because it not longer is a choice as such, rather sometimes they have to live with. But can everyone stop hiding behind this shield, because this isn’t the case with everyone or even most people that are overweight."
This post is EXACTLY why people who struggle with weight problems need that movement as much as you do.  Your frustration with your own struggles does not excuse the body shaming that you are doing in this post.
Obesity is dangerous and not good for anyone. Giving false praise to is doing way more harm than most understand.
This unpopular opinion subreddit not popular opinion.
"As someone who went from college athletics to fat as hell and back to form, I completely agree. I went to a few fat seminars where people would literally sit there and lie to each other.

Like it’s not that hard, it’s calories in minus calories out. Yet people here would share food logs that were like:

“Monday: celery and peanut butter in the morning, a smoothie for lunch and a salad for dinner”

Then they’d have this in their lot for like 3 years. HUN NO ONE BELIEVES YOU. Yet everyone else would be nodding. 

We’d get to the “I’m healthy, I eat right, I exercise but my body is just like this.”

NO FAT CELLS DONT WORK LIKE THAT IN ANY MAMMALIAN LIFE FORM YOU ARE NOT THE .00000001%.

It’s completely delusional. But the seminar probably saved my life because it made me realize that I didn’t have an eating disorder...I was depressed and needed PTSD therapy. 

Those folks just dig themselves deeper into lunacy, it’s a total waste of time. It’s an echo chamber of insanity."
No need to gatekeep a whole movement. Anyone can be body positive.
"Not only that the movement is really not for everyone. You never see boys in the body positivity movement because it's shuned upon to be a fat male and those exact people usually always date or attracted to men that is usually fit, but get mad when Males aren't attracted to them. It's really hypocritical."
"I see posts about this crap constantly. We get it, you don't like fat people. Lets pick another topi to constantly whine about because this is clearly not an unpopular opinion."
"Theoretically it should be for everyone. It is supposed to be. But from the perspective of marketing companies and fashion brands it's a lot easier to get people on board with busty fat girls than someone who is visibly sick or ""damaged""...

 There are positive images of disability and chronic illness out there, there are individuals leading that charge, but there are also a lot more fat girls in the world than girls with truly unconventional bodies. If you shared images of your body with a statement about your insecurities/pride, you would be embraced by well-meaning people and those who love you. (Not to say you wouldn't also probably get hate from ignorant people.) 

A few years ago I posted a comparison pic of myself at 60kg (anorexic, hadn't menstruated in months) vs at 90kg (eating healthy, feeling very 'body positive' for the first time) with a statement about how much better I felt in the second photo and how my self image had improved. And of course people commented saying I looked 'just as beautiful' when I was skinny. They didn't mean to hurt me, but it hurt.

What actually matters is how you actually feel and your health and wellbeing, outside of popular opinion. If you are feeling better and healthier than before, you should be able to congratulate yourself. If your health is in decline, you should still be able to love your body and thank it for everything it has got you through."
"Lack of exercise and over-eating (especially heavily processed foods) is generally detrimental to your health. Although there are those who have disorders/genes that make their body absorb fats more easily and such (therefore seeming larger), the movement can often *imply* that any form of ""fatness"" is 100% OK. This is false. Genetic problems are, well, genetic. Over-eating and lack of exercise is a personal self-drive issue.  


TL;DR: The body-positive movements gives the negative implication that being ""fat"" in general is something to embrace, although it should be more centred around unchangeable aspects like genes or disorders as opposed to ""it's ok to be big""."
"There are too many movements in general. Too many people out there don't know how to be independently strong, so they team up and ruin Shit for everyone else."
"Body Positive is about accepting the people inside the skin, regardless of the skin.  And it does sometimes mean weight.  It started with the idea that people shouldn't idealize the bodies of fashion models with a BMI of 15.

But it's more than weight.  It's also about being comfortable in your own body even if it's not ""airbrushed porn star"" perfect.  That could include scars, asymmetry, freckles, hair, etc. 

But it doesn't make it healthy to have a BMI of 35 either.  I won't rag on somebody with weight problems.... it's not my business.  But the fact is that it's not healthy and praising it won't change that.

You should try nudism (At a resort NOT the beach).  Nudist are professionals at accepting their own and others' bodies while still having an interest in fitness."
I wanna see them march for their rights personally. The shortest march in history.
You are absolutely right and it's awful. We really need to stop encouraging it.
"As someone who is pretty chunky, the body positivity shit is stupid. Why encourage people to keep being unhealthy?"
"I've been seeing a lot of people responding to Facebook ads wherein a skinny girl or skinny-ish girl is shown. Not disproportionate, no boney skeleton-high fashion models. Just naturally skinny girls. 

I shouldn't open the comments but I do, simply because I already know there is going to be 'heavier' girls complaining and going ""Feed her a burger"", or ""Unrealistic"".It may be a skinny model, but that does not make it unrealistic nor anorexic just because she is used for an add. I am naturally skinny, whilst easily eating more (if not double)  than the average adult. I have been bullied because of my appearance as well, being given sandwiches I HAD to eat in front of like 6 or 7 bullies in order to prove I was not anorexic, which I did not do because I was and am a vegetarian, and their sandwiches were loaded with meats. (And even if I were not, whatthefuck...)

Just because it is not your reality, does not mean it is unrealistic altogether. And body shaming is not 'just' when it is aimed towards a person for being skinny.

"I swear I've seen this piece of ""unpopular"" opinion for more than 1000 times on this sub. This is not unpopular. Stop. For fuck's sake"
"What about people with self harm scars? Should we exclude them too because it's ""their fault""?

You don't know people's life stories. People become fat due to various reasons: Depression, medical issues, addictions, etc. Writing them off as ""fat girls who like cake"" is very ignorant. Would you say the same shitty things about skinny people?"
OP I've been  reading some of your responses and it seems you might need some therapy. I really think it will help. Bringing others down to increase your own lack of confidence is not a permanent solution. You can find some peace.
"Body positivity is a personal, internal thing, not a movement.

If you want to have body positivity, you can. Nobody can stop you. That's why it's such a great thing.

Also, the way you talked about ""vain fat girls"" was extremely ugly. Everyone with self-esteem and body-image issues is suffering. Your suffering doesn't change that. Be better than this."
we are never going to get actual unpopular opinions on this sub huh
PREACH
Yup. You can fix bieng fat. Scars or missing limbs/digits are a little harder. I think lazy people use the 'body positive' movement to cover for the fact that they dont want to eat healthy and hit the gym.
"I’m biased here because I’ve never been overweight but the thing is I have had eating disorders most of my life and when it gets bad and I’m at a low weight it isn’t like the stereotypical eating disorder person who is thin but looks in the mirror and thinks they’re fat. I know exactly how I look and know that my body looks like what a lot of people want theirs to look like. However, I don’t wear revealing clothing or post pictures of my body when I’m at a low weight because I hate the idea of being praised for being unhealthy. I don’t like receiving compliments on my body because it makes me feel guilty about being unhealthy. 

I could be wrong and this is completely different but I don’t really get wanting to be praised for being unhealthy. I know not every overweight person is unhealthy due to their eating and exercise habits but I’m pretty it’s only a small percentage of them that actually have health issues that make them overweight."
Scar gang in the house
"In before the *body positivity* or *fat girls who like cake*  call this ""gate keeping"""
"As a fat person I agree, being fat isn't a beautiful and a brave thing. Having a higher risk of getting basically everything isn't inspiring."
"My sister is morbidly obese and heavy (!) on the body positive movement. She’s also a fat person fashion blogger. 

She’s so fucking unhealthy but won’t hear a word about it, so my parents have stopped trying."
"So I’ll go easy on you since you sound like you aren’t over the age of 15.

Your post and comments directly contradict each other. You say you have low self esteem, so what do you do? You start attacking girls that likely also have self esteem issues because you think their feelings are invalid.

Maybe some of those overweight people feel really down about being fat, and these body positive groups help them get through the day. 

Grow up."
"Of course. Just as LGBT is used by the wrong people instead of furthering rights.



There is an agenda to deconstruct certain values such as beauty, strength, masculinity, femininity, sexuality and history.



And the people pushing it don't give one fuck about their victims."
I’ve got no problem with overweight people accepting themselves and being happy with their weight. But the minute they start promoting that it’s not unhealthy is where they’ve crossed the line for me.
"Nemo should be an iconic figure for this movement  with his small fin, not obese people"
"Honestly tho, screw fat people, just lose some fkin weight. I was fat and hated myself. It helped. I lost weight."
True
"Hey... your opinion is valid and you're right, the movement should focus more on the groups you mentioned but please, please, please, don't dunk on us fat girls. Or even fat men.

Wanting to feel human and pretty isn't vanity. We get treated like garbage by everyone. We get told how to live all the time, we get pressured by people who want to ""help"" by giving unsolicited advece. A lot of us get straight up abused by their families, SOs, employers and friends. We get put through hell by people who claim to love us. Our self esteem is systemically destroyed from a young age. Kids at school call us fat, whales, monsters, blobs, fatasses, piggies-- they always find something degrading to call us and that chases us through our lives. Clothing shops are painful to search through for something to wear that doesn't make us look like hobos. 

Ffs, doctors won't treat whatever symptoms we might have, they try to make us lose weight. I almost died once because a doctor wouldn't look past my weight to see the severe kidney infection. Every doctor I've ever met has lectured me on my weight even if it had nothing to do with the problem I've gone in for. I was suffering a potential lethal fever and some stupid nurse tried to give me a diet plan. 

We're not always fat ""because we like cake"". Many of us have hormonal and system disorders that affect our weight. Eating is a stress-induced coping mechanism for others that exagerrates already existing problems. Being fat is a complicated issue with no single cause. 

Life can be hell if you're fat, because everyone turns against you and makes it out to be your fault. You subject yourself to torturous procedures and diets in an attempt to ""be normal"" and knowing that nine times outta ten they don't work and you get traumatized. You diet to the point of misery and once you eat eve a CRUMB outside the diet, you gain everything back. The rollercoaster of weight never ends. 

So yeah, the movement should focus more on people with other issues, like yours, but otherwise fuck your attitude about fat people. We're human too and don't deserve this shit."
I think the message got a bit muddled. I think what they were trying to say is FAT people should be treated the same. But the message got lost with all the fatties trying to say being fat is normal. As an overweight person myself I can tell you being fat is ugly. The health issues it causes are to many to mention. Fat is not beautiful and I am all for treating fat peoppe with dignity and respect I will not support a message saying it is positive.
"I’m in a facebook group of 10,000 girls in my city and the surrounding cities and every single day there are MULTIPLE posts of overweight girls in lingerie talkin bout loving themselves. If you go to their profile and other social media’s they’ll always be filled with a copious amount of heavily filtered selfies and more lingerie pictures. I have never EVER seen a similar post in the group from someone who appears to be living a normal life with an appropriate number of selfies that actually look like them and aren’t edited as shit. 

THE IRONY that 90% of these posts are edited and filtered is ASTRONOMICAL."
This is what  r/fatlogic subreddit is all about.
this is posted every day
r/fatlogic is a great sub if you want to witness the sorts of people that populate the delusional fat girls demographic
"I was all the way there with you right up until you were a rude arsehole about other people's bodies. 

It is not up to you to gate-keep on this movement. Just because you don't like overweight people doesn't mean you have a right to be nasty."
And then they actually get upset if anybody shows concern for their health and stuff like that too. Not to mention they think the world is excluding them by not tailoring everything to their needs.
"The HAES movement needs to die soon and the fatties need to lose weight in order to improve their health and live longer.  Otherwise, covid is gonna thin them out literally.  It's here to stay for life."
There's not excuse for being morbidly obese.
"Absolutely. I meam, it os true you shouldn't shame fat people or anyone for the way they are, but being fat is reversible, other things (which they don't mention) aren't. I used to be fat, and even though I didn't feel a huge complex about it just to be healthier I started working out and eating better. What they are doing with the body positive movement is telling people that it is perfectly fine yo be fat which it isn't (I don't mean it in a physical way, more in a health way). It's like telling a junkie that it's fine to be an addict, instead of trying to help him stop his bad ways without shaming him."
Totally agree. I am a bit chubby but I can perfectly live with that. I know that if I want I can lose weight. Fat people who are in that movement always make it seem like they are the victim and that it’s other people’s fault that they consume 30.000 calories a day. I know some people who have something that is wrong with their body and those people are not getting the recognition they deserve.
"Bro scars are awesome, (at least they look cool in my opinion) think of each scar as a story! You’ve got your life mapped up if you want to!"
Here comes the arbiter of beauty to tell super fat people that they should feel bad about themselves if they want to lose weight. Man this ass backwards thinking never stops. Who cares if some fatass chick thinks she's hot shit. I'm sorry that you're jealous of a morbidly obese chick. Sad.
"Isn't body positive to be accepting of what cannot be changed and embracing it?

Fat people can just lose weight albeit abit hard"
"I totally agree with this. I have a friend who is a little fluffy, she works very hard at her job and is on her feet all day. Yeah she eats like shit, she eats the most greasy fattening foods that I cant bring myself to eat without gagging. She is attractive, she could change her body and be healthy but she won't. But that doesn't mean there's not hope. I very much agree with you that the body positivity is more towards fluffy people. 

But I think a lot of them do you generally want to get help but don't have the right support system at home or maybe they don't have friends maybe they got other issues going on. I always like to put this thought in line before I start saying oh there a lazy piece of shit. There are some people who are very lazy and that is true but not all of us. There are also a lot of people who do you want to get better but need support. 

It's extremely hard to get motivated to get better when you don't have a supportive environment. Yes eating healthy can help, also having the right mindset and taking care of yourself and not pushing yourself too hard. You will have to go out of your comfort zone to overcome what you were dealing with but that's worth it for the results in the end, right?


I also suffer with very low self-esteem and I very much hate my body. I struggled with eating as well. I can't relate in the same way, but I can't imagine how stressful it must be to be very fluffy. I very much support being your best self, and loving yourself. Now all the stuff sounds really fucking hard and it is but baby steps is what gets things done. You don't need to take the world's biggest step to start making a difference you can take a little step, the little steps count.

I am no expert in any field of losing or gaining weight or becoming fit. But everyday try to eat a little bit healthier. Like today eat your daily meal you want to eat, maybe toss in an apple, cup of orange juice! Cup of milk? Have a some baby carrots. Did you know carrots are good for your eyesight? (Tomska joke intended as well)

Don't starve yourself because it doesn't do anything. Fuck laxatives those are stupid. You don't need plastic surgery you're already beautiful, so shut up. Also since we're like trapped inside all the time sort of still, dress up at home and go all out. Put on your best suit or your prettiest dress. Get comfy in your body.  You can try journaling write down what you're feeling everyday and how every day is going. Walk around the house. I know exercise is a great deal of this. But you don't have to do extreme in the beginning take it easy you're just starting you don't have to dive in head first. And if you make a mistake it's okay we're human we mess up. Try and form a structure or like a routine around your day-to-day basis. My counselor told me to do this to this, so I could feel more in control of my life. I don't know if it works in this situation, but I thought I'd add it. 

On one more note, I would like to add there are some illnesses and disorders that do cause people to have permanent weight gain or they just gained a lot of weight. That's not their fault they were born that way don't shame them that way. Because there are people that do have genuine problems and some of them can't be fixed we just have to learn to deal with them and accept them as part of us. And that's really hard.

Another thought maybe to try therapy be like counseling talking to someone. Talking to someone helps so much. Try to find a counselor that you can talk to you and vent to about this and maybe they can help you form a plan to help get better or something. It's really good to start finding supports if you don't have any. Those steps are very scary but they're worth it. :)

I believe we are all capable of change and loving ourselves. Even though the road ahead looks tough, I believe if we come together, compassion, love and support I think we could help a lot of these people, and they could help themselves. 

Also if you want to spread positivity, maybe go message random people on here and be like hey have a good day. Or I think you're a wonderful person. Or whatever. Sometimes complimenting or talking to strangers helps a lot. And sometimes if you compliment a stranger and they compliment you back it feels so good. And also you're making people smile. Spread love and not hate.

I hope this message makes sense and it's not just all ramble together.

Edit: typos"
"I feel like everyone is missing the point. It's simply that you shouldn't assume you know the first thing about someone based on their appearance.  

Trying to say fat people are somehow doing something wrong by wanting to be a part of it seems like exactly opposite of that point.  

Maybe leave the judgements behind, not every issue is as simple as ""put down the fork"""
"How many of these posts will show up on this sub? There was one that said the exact same thing last week. What I will say is that it is still socially acceptable to make fun of and mock overweight people. It is not acceptable to mock anyone with any other disability or condition. People might do it, but everyone agrees that those people are unequivocally wrong. No one, as this post so perfectly demonstrates, considers it a bad thing to tell fat people to “stop eating so much cake” as if being overweight is truly that simple for all people universally. This is why the movement started; fat people needed to band together against a society that is pretty much unanimously telling them that they are lazy, ugly, and worthless, regardless of personal circumstance. That doesn’t meant that there isn’t room for other imperfect bodies in the movement, just that telling a person with a body covered in scars that they are ugly is 100% unacceptable, while telling a fat person the same thing is not."
"""I'm proud"", she said as her bare hands dug into the tub of Ben and Jerry's Chunky Monkey.


""I'm fat..."", were the words that escaped her maw, white cream dribbling down her mouth like a waterfall of cum.


""and I'm Proud.."", but her tone told the truth. The words barely escaped her, each one squeaking out, the amount of air required to vocalize anything a herculean effort. There was no power to her voice, only a trembling and desperate uncertainty. If one had been in the room to hear her, they would barely be able to make out the words through the gushing of ice cream between sausage fingers or the subtle undercurrent of sobbing. Not to mention the hum of her incessant breathing, which came at such a arrhythmic regularity that one could quite easily mistake it for an air conditioner sputtering out in its final days.


She was not proud, nay, but she was indeed fat. The internet fed her lies. It made her believe what she had done to her body was acceptable. The voices made her think that working for your fitness was something to be ashamed of, that people who thought about the food they consumed were miserable. Body Positivity was a lie she could live by. It covered up all of her faults, gave her a convenient mask to hide away the insecurities which plagued her, and a cult to join as to not feel isolated and weak, but together and strong.


Rick and Morty flashed on to the television, she was bingeing it for the 3rd time this week. ""I'm fat and I'm proud"", she whispered to her self, a tear rolling down her cheek to meet. Her tongue was slithering about, hunting for a glop of Monkey Chunks caught in her fuzzy mustache, but all it got was a salty tear. Her fingers scraped against the bottom of the ice cream tub, puncturing a hole in it. Her mad longing for dopamine led her to today's first act of violence, perpetrated against Ben and Jerry, her oldest friends.


""RAFAEL!"", she screamed, ""MAMA NEED SOME MORE CREAM BABY!"". A frightened Salvadorian child no more than 8 years old rushed down the stairs, fear hot in his eyes. He was adopted, a little boy to care for her so she didn't have to do it herself. He instinctively knew what to do, running to the fridge to get Phish Food. She always had 2 ice creams for breakfast.

Rafael put the tub into her writhing hands, careful not to get too close, frightened he may contract whatever disease it was that led her to such extreme self neglect. She cackled and tore off the lid, rearing her head back before plunging face first into the ice cream. Rafael quietly slipped away, tip toeing back up the stairs, unable to look away from the monstrosity. Once up the stairs he reached into his pocket, pulling out a few carrots. He smiled to himself, a real happiness, as he munched on the orange sticks. He ran to the end of the hall, enjoying the feel of his own physical ability. He laughed as he entered his room, content with his body and the way he felt. Rafael knew what it was to love oneself, and he had his adoptee mother to thank for showing him everything not to do."
"Body Dysmorphic gang.

I wholeheartedly agree. I used to be severely underweight (now I'm just moderately underweight) and would constantly be bullied for it. Especially by a girl who was probably around three times my weight (aka she actually benefitted from the positivity movement). She'd constantly remind me of how ""lucky"" I was to be thin, how much she wished I was fat so I would ""know what it's like"" (at one point she went into graphic detail about how she'd transfer her fat to me), and went as far as to throw food at me to ""fatten me up"".

All while I was near death because of anorexia. Less than a month into the school year, I was admitted to an inpatient facility for intense weight restoration. I was told at my weight, I could basically have a heart attack at any moment. My BMI was 12.6, around the same as Eugenia fucking Cooney.

You'd think the body positivity movement would have saved me from getting bullied, but I learned very quickly that it turns a blind eye to underweight people. I was a walking corpse, and all anyone could do is berate me for having a not-so-invisible mental illness. Bodies being glorified is just as toxic as them being hated. Do I think my weight should have been accepted at the time? No, clearly that's dangerous. However, it's equally dangerous for a movement that preaches ""body positivity"" to only speak towards one end of the spectrum."
"I believe fat people do need the emotional support, but I've noticed this, too.

Body shaming seems forgotten for all these groups:

* - skinny people with body image issues
* - people with general body image issues (face, etc.)
* - people with small breasts
* - people with small dicks
* - short people
* - bald people
* - people with scars
* - people with deformities or uncommon ratios

And often all these are fair game for insults and jokes so, uhh, OK. Body shaming is largely alive and well.

Main focus of the body shame movement seems to be people with large breasts and fat people and I wanna know what happened lol"
"Or like, maybe everyone can be positive about their body and it's not a ""wrong people"" situation. 

Fat, skinny, skin colour, birth marks, burns, scars, amputee etc. Everyone has the right to love themselves so maybe just feel positive about yourself and mind your own business about other people.

You're literally spreading hate while at the same time saying you should be allowed to be body positive. Hypocritical much?"
Wouldn't they be constantly red then
"Obesity is a disease and it fucks your body in so many different ways, you should not celebrate it, you shouldn’t shame it either but trying to make people think it’s ok to be obese is wrong and dangerous"
"Another unpopular opinion: you could also just be positive about your own body without receiving validation from strangers and pay no attention to anyone else’s body or their reasoning. 

I’m all for body positivity but do we all have to post a pic online in lingerie to prove that we feel it for ourselves? Not really. 
It’s just another way to seek validation from an outside source and when it’s done that way, it’s unreliable and unhealthy for everyone. 

Worry about yourself and what’s healthy for you. 
It’s called self-esteem for a reason.

I have skin problems and low self-esteem at times. That’s my burden to bear and my issue to be dealt with. It keeps me busy. 

We don’t have a right to speak on anyone else’s body. If someone insults you or your looks, that reflects on the type of person THEY are and doesn’t have anything to do with you. 

Only TRULY MISERABLE people need to bring other people down in order to lift themselves up and make themselves feel better. 

Everybody is going through something, we should all be practicing compassion and humility."
"I have always seen it this way as well. Something that a person was born with or can’t be helped should not be ridiculed and used to make her feel ugly. However, obesity can be helped. It’s unhealthy and you’re not doing anyone a favor by saying they’re beautiful because they weigh 400 lbs."
"The point isn't for fat people to feel good about being fat. The point is for fat people not to hate themselves for being fat. It doesn't mean we don't have to try to be healthy, it just means we're still allowed to feel good about ourselves too. Self-loathing is not an effective motivator for most people. People who feel good about themselves feel able to make positive changes in their lives; people who hate themselves tend to feel helpless and hopeless.

Yes, I'm fat. And I don't like being fat, and I wish I wasn't. But I don't hate myself for it, and I'm trying to change. It's not so easy for some of us. I've been to a dietitian, who has fully approved my eating habits and says what I need is more exercise, not less food. But I have fibromyalgia, which really limits how much exercise I can handle. I have to work up to it slowly. I also HATE exercising, and most of the activities that incorporate exercise, so it's especially hard to motivate myself. 

Should I hate myself for that? Because to me it just seems like the human condition. There are obstacles I need to overcome. I'm trying. I don't hate myself for it, I'm cheering myself on and I give myself full credit every time I take a step forward.

If that's a problem for you -- if you feel like I am in some way obligated to hate myself for my fatness -- that is a YOU problem, not a ME problem, and you should examine why you think people ought to hate themselves for being imperfect. Are you perfect? Have you achieved 100% of your life goals? Do you struggle with some more than others? Do you hate yourself for that? Do you think that's helpful, or does it make things harder for you?"
"And why exactly do we *have* to pit “the girl with cystic fibrosis” against “girls who like cake” in the first place?  

What rule is there that means it needs to be one at the expense of the other?"
There is nothing better than when an *actually affected* person calls out the bullshit of *coopting crybabies* in a given movement.  You are awesome.
"Fat guy here. 100% agree, I hate the body positive movement, purely because of every fatass using as an excuse to be fat. NO FAT SHAMING, FATFOBIA YOU INCEL, MEN LIKE OVERWEIGHT GIRLS, etc. Fuck you I can call you a fatass if I want."
"By definition, not all people are beautiful. They can only be not discriminated."
"The Book of Mormon was funny, actually."
"I agree completely, but this is not an unpopular opinion"
When the left and the right is undertaking.
You are the intended group for the statement. Instead it's preached almost exclusively by overweight women who want some kind of gratification for accepting there size when in reality they are probably putting their health at risk and probably encouraging children that it is a healthy image. A lot of comments have said that is exclusively applied to or by obese women and seemingly accepted by most other women but I have never seen an overweight man praised in a similar way.
The Pats are in a relationship.
"you were on the right track and then you lost it. body posi has been taken over by skinny ppl to be really honest. also fat people started body posi so it’s theirs, it’s should include disabled people and people with disfigurements but if you feel it doesn’t make your own thing if you’re that upset about it ??? like it’s not that hard."
American football is a chess match.
"Just like many of these movements today, the body positivity movement was invaded by people who hide behind the movement as a means of avoiding accountability. Now when these people are 500+ pounds and refuse to exercise, they'll simply say ""it's my body and I love myself, you ableist fat-shamer"". It's pathetic."
"This is the same with any movement.  There will be some who redefine it and mean something different.

Some  good vibes and positive people don’t want to be accountable on their shit.

Some defund the police folks want to get away with crimes. 

Most Pro lifers don’t care after your born.

Again, it’s with any group. People have agendas."
This was literally posted about two weeks ago.
"This is not unpopular and is posted about and accepted widely, especially on reddit."
When’s my turn to post this “unpopular” opinion
Too bad. Reddit has been advocating fat acceptance for like 8 years. They are recently turning around. I expect the same thing with other woke aspects to happen in coming years.
"I think everyone hates something about their body, even the narcissists on instagram who appear perfect have flaws that they use filters and angles to hide.

Thats how you learn to love yourself.  When you remember that everyone is insecure about something, you can start to give yourself a little break.  You don't need a movement to feel good about yourself, you just need to slowly start complimenting yourself for the things you really like about yourself. 

Focus on the positive and not the negative and it will change how you see yourself.  

I know that sounds really corny and stupid, but it does work!"
"A post about body positivity is published in this sub every other week. Please make sure your opinion is actually unpopular because when you search this sub, you'll find so many similar posts, they don't even fit on one page."
"Yup. I had severe scoliosis (70*) and surgery to correct it. The end result was a straight spine but I kept growing so now my ribs flare out and it looks like I have a bubble gut. This is not my description but other peoples, because there has been little cultural movement to stop insults against people like me."
"All the movement should be about is to treat fat people as humans, which most don't. Not healthy, just a person."
As a girl considered plus size I totally agree with this. I dislike that body positivity is an excuse for bigger girls to not lose weight and become healthy or heathier. Granted there's girls who are obese and still stick to a healthy lifestyle but it hard for them to lose weight due to medical problems and such. There's also girls who are actively trying to loose weight and get healthier like myself. I'm right in the middle of plus size being to small to be considered plus size but still big enough to be considered it. I this whole movement is a bunch of BS and don't stand by it. Yes you should love yourself but your not loving yourself enough if you don't see that your weight is an actual health problem. I think the movement would very much benefit others who are stuck in the body they have and change change anything about it like OP said. There is some people who fit that category in the movement but it's more focused on fat people and it's frustrating
"As someone that’s been overweight most of my life, I totally agree. There’s nothing positive about being unhealthy or convincing yourself you’re obese and beautiful. Instead of correcting bad habits people use it to take the easy way out and pretend there’s nothing wrong with a lack of self discipline."
Holy shit! There wasn’t a period in that entire post.
"There were movements by people with such issues like difference in skin pigments or other types of skin imperfections, but the problem is that they’re trying to romanticize it in some way. It’s nice that people are being supportive to themselves and others, but at the same time these people may take it very personally if you don’t find them attractive (as if it’s something you have control of). Anyways, I support any person who tries to feel comfortable about his/her body. Personally, I’ve been a skinny, medium height male all my life (which you picked on for sometimes), but I don’t feel the need to get fatter just cause people expect me to be. I’m comfortable like that, and I hope everybody feels the same about their bodies"
"Thing is, you can’t also berate people to lose weight. You need to support them. Eating is normally an addiction or a coping mechanism. It’s important to feel happy in your own body, people need to lose weight but encourage people in a good way."
"A little late to the party but I feel that. I am a skinny dude who has always felt insecure about my body. All my life, all I’ve ever wanted was to be muscular, or hell, even chunky. I’ve never been as strong as my brothers and that has always made me feel horrible about myself. Always asking someone for help lifting things I should be able to has made me feel inadequate. It sticks to tell someone that you’re uncomfortable in your own body only to hear, “But you’re so skinny! Why?!” It’s like people gatekeep being uncomfortable with being fat. I hate my body too."
I see so many ex-anorexic people posting “love your body” ya da ya da ya da. Sure I do. That doesn’t mean I don’t have a problem with overeating. Which I most certainly do.
"I'm surprised it's not named ""That's how we roll""."
"Yes. Body positivity is important but not when your habits destroy your body. If being fat wouldnt make any problems for your health, I would be all in. But when it does, it is just unhealthy. Weight is not a constant, people get attached to their looks, but its a really wrong thing to do, since its really not hard to change it. Lets leave body positivity for people without limbs, with scars, skin pigments and so on. They cannot change their looks, they need acceptance to feel good. And if you're  fat to a point you dont feel comfortable, you shouldnt be seeking validation  you should be seeking help to lose the unnecessary weight. Thats all."
"Do you know of Jameela Jamil? She’s an actress. (She’s annoying to some, to be fair, but I just find her bold. and at the least entertaining.) 

She has a “body positivity” campaign that’s about getting the focus OFF the body (looks, weight, etc) and measuring yourself by other aspects of your life that actually represent who you are.

Maybe worth checking out for you? I think it has a lot of good content. Best of luck."
"I completely agree .. to a point. I believe the ""movement"" is doing more harm than good. There is no such thing as a healthy fat\overweight\obese\husky\big bones\whatever-label. 

But, some of your comments made it sound like it is a competition. It isn't. I understand you are struggling to find a support group but that doesn't mean the ""movement"" is being used by the wrong people.  

If you can't find a support group maybe try starting your own?"
"Aye, but we shoulda seen it coming to begin with. Humans are shite, and those like them are the worst. Ruining good things to reinforce their unhealthy and lethal activities. Convincing children it's okay to be 300+lbs and die from diabetes at 30 is NOT okay. 

If anything, the movement should support becoming healthy. Not super model thin, but like 130lbs-200lbs if you aren't ripped. Male or female. 

But that's the weight side of it. I don't really know much about other types of, or yours, bodily defects(sorry, I spent like 10 minutes thinking of another word) and it's probably because of all the whales begging for death at the little debbies isle and demanding for people to call them sexy on CNN."
We know. It’s posted here twice a week and is probably the most POPULAR opinion on reddit
"It’s sad that people have taken the body positivity movement to mean “fat girls encouraging other fat girls”. What it has actually done is push for a healthier standard of beauty. Muscles and curves have become much more generally recognized as beautiful then just thinness. Generally, prior to the movement, an ideal western model fit a very specific mold. They had to be very very thin, tall, blond and white. It took a lot for companies to see beauty in more than that mold. Take Victoria’s Secret models 10 years ago compared to today.

Now it is very common to see models of different ethnicities and body types. The average size for an American woman (last I checked) was a size 14. So for a size 6 to be considered plus size in the modeling industry, was very out of proportion. It led to a lot of unhealthy standards.
People talk about glamorizing obesity but never want to talk about how the media used to glamorize eating disorders."
"I, like many others, work hard to be physically fit and healthy.
I really can't get behind anything that remotely encourages the overweight Pandemic that has been going on for decades."
Sad that more people have more things to do
My friend tried so hard to get me into the Instagram ‘body positivity’ craze saying it gave her way more body confidence as a bigger girl. I replied I would rather keep following fitness accounts to motivate me to be healthier and she was genuinely insulted. It’s not about body positivity at all it’s about fat/ obesity acceptance.
"You're right, of course insulting a person just because their fat isn't a good thing but then again considering it as body positivity isn't really right either, excess fat is bad for your health after all"
Or maybe both?
"I completely relate to you, but just remember that you do not have to be part of these groups to feel comfortable in your own body.

I have a large amount of acne and self harm scars all over my body, which lead to most people in highschool nicknaming me ""the zombie""

Hating your own body is one thing, but others others telling you that it's grotesque really hit home.

But you know what I did? I embraced the things I couldn't change about my body. 

Once I accepted my position as zombie, I went along with the joke and starting chasing people in a zombie voice. After that it was a lot less bullying and a lot more friendly once I accepted my body and that I was going to love it weather other people liked it or not. 

Of course I still get self-conscious about it, but I'll never let it get me down.

So when a bunch of severely obese people come along who clearly hate their body but are too lazy to lose weight become the most outspoken part of body positively movement, it can fustrate me all hell knowing that I worked damn hard to make my body healthy despite the major scarring, but just be proud of yourself more that anything."
"Even average people suffer from low self esteem, it's not even that appearance minorities that are being ignored anymore, they are totally ignoring the average insecure girl/boy who is being brainwashed by the media and Instagram and also promoting an unhealthy lifestyle. And I am  not talking about healthy plus size women/men or people with health problems who can't loose weight, I'm talking about people like Ted's Holiday."
"I couldn't agree more. Coming from the outside and I guess considered ""normal?""   I've never seen a problem with things like scaring or anything unique to a person. Obesity is not that thing! It is unhealthy for the individual. I'm super happy the self confidence is there, but that is 100% promoting unhealthy habits.  I also understand that some of those people I'm referring too it is somewhat out of their control and for those few you have no reason not to love yourself!"
Body positivity does not mean that you can eat whatever you want and not exercise and then when people make fun of you because you’re fat ..you get upset ...that’s not how life works
"My girlfriend has a large port wine stain on her face but she doesn't really seem to worry too much about it. She has had way bigger issues being anorexic and coming to accept that her natural state is a little overweight. Body positivity to her is very much weight correlated despite her not having an unblemished face. There is definitely some weird feedback loop between the two states because whether or not she lost weight, she would not consider herself to be ""pretty"" because of her face. Eating disorders are really serious and body positivity is good in helping people who are somewhat overweight into feeling better about themselves, not necessarily just helping people who ""like cake""."
"Surely anyone who has a body should be part of the body positive movement. We all come in different shapes and sizes. We all have our own body issues. Why can’t we all be part of the movement? Why should one shape be excluded over someone who has body scars?

Why can’t ya’ll just accept that everyone is different and that’s something that should be celebrated. You should be celebrating yourself as you are rather than pulling others down."
"Body positivity isn't a finite resource, people can feel good about themselves without having to put others down, so I don't see any reason to complain about this honestly."
"I'm also on the team that girls abuse this to no end, as a fat guy I still get body shamed..

If someone calls a girl fat, she gets support, everyone is rushing to her defense, your body is beautiful, you don't have to be ashamed, while chugging down a couple donuts."
"I‘ve been overweight myself in my late 20s, roughly around 60 lbs too much on my body. The reason mostly being lazy and finding excuses like ‚I don’t have enough time for this.‘ I really didn‘t like myself back then. Adding to this the results of blood tests and things like pain from just walking up two sets of stairs kept getting worse every year. One day I just had enough of this and turned that whole shit around. I now feel better than ever even though I am 8 years older now. I go montainbiking twice a week and additionally go to the gym at least two times. I still occasionally eat fatty stuff like fast food or sweets, but due to the regular training it simply doesn‘t show.

Even with that experience I still get steamrolled by those people defending body positivity. I know the difference, I experienced it myself and they just go and brush it off like it‘s nothing."
THICCCC****
"It's not an unpopular opinion inside Reddit. And also kinda outside of it, but the market gets money for it so they pursue it."
"I feel like the one who isn’t bothered by this stuff? I mean they KNOW they aren’t healthy size, but if they are comfortable in their skin then good for them! I don’t see how it’s any of my business anyway? Similarly, if you have some other sort of body issues (like scars) it’s none of my business! But if you wear them proudly then good for you! I think that’s awesome! I think of “flaws” as character but that’s me. If you don’t have anything nice to say don’t say anything at all! I don’t think I’ve ever directly commented negatively on someone’s appearance? Maybe once? And she was a VERY ill youtuber who weighed like 60lbs, being a nurse I couldn’t keep my mouth shut on that one. Lol I think she ended up getting help after media got wind of her. I hear “body positive” and assume that encompasses anything having to do with the body. Not just weight. If you think it’s been hijacked by “fat” folks, take it back! Make it an inclusive movement!"
This isn’t an unpopular opinion.  We are all forced to pretend it is.
"I agree OP! I have a huge scar that goes from my left shoulder to under my left breast. Its from heart surgery as an infant and as an adolescent I was always shy about wearing tank tops because I felt people were staring at the scar. I finally ran out of fucks to give in my late 30's and started wearing  cute tanks, spaghetti strap tops and dresses. The realization that the surgery *saved my life* and I shouldn't be ashamed of my scar was really freeing!"
"“Fat Acceptance” came up with such gems as “healthism” and its advocates encourage people, especially young people, to throw their health and lives away for what? To eat way more than they need and pretend it’s not a choice, or that choosing health is wrong. It’s despicable."
"I am very insecure about my body, but im relatively skinny. I am super short though, 4""9, mostly genetics but also because I didn't get much to eat as a kid. I have severe eczema that leaves large patches of my skin darkened and scarred. I've got four surgical scars from infections due to my eczema.

But despite all this, whenever I try to openly identify with the body positivity movement, I get shut down because I'm not overweight. Maybe I'm not, but I do want to feel more normal about my body, and isn't that what the body positivity movement is meant to be about?

I don't believe in excluding overweight people though. Cake isn't the only reason, and even if it were, shame isn't an effective motivator for someone to try and get healthier. Body positivity should be for everyone."
"I’m an overweight person (not really fat but above where I want to be) and the movement annoys the shit out of me, people in my situation (or worse ones) should be trying to get motivated to get into better shape, not trying to feel happy they’re a lardass.  I’m tired of the “you should be comfortable in your own skin” argument too, like if you wanna be comfortable in it why not stop stuffing it to the fucking max capacity?"
Post this on change my view.
"ANYONE should be empowered to feel positive about their own body, regardless of how different it is from the ""socially acceptable"" ideal.  You do you, honey, and leave others to themselves."
"Not to mention those fat bitches are the first to shit on skinny girls and insult their body types. A real woman is fat? Hell no, you just have no discipline, that should never be celebrated. I know a bunch of girls who are naturally skinny who get shit from fat girls. Blows my mind. They aren't interested in body positivity they just want to get away with eating cake. But guess what, you can't force anyone to find lard and no effort attractive."
"You know what a “movement” is?  Some like-minded people working together on something they care about.  

You want a movement that addresses your specific concerns?  Seek out a few people who have a similar feelings and work to become a resource for others.

But using your own low self esteem as an excuse to lash out at fat girls?

That makes you a shitty person. You may want to fix that impulse as part of your journey."
Didn't this come up last week?
"I have scars, tall for a woman, etc. Do you know what people attack me for first? My weight. My body is a body and deserves respect. Whether or notnits genetics or ""because i like cake"" you should mind your buisness."
Exactly!!! I have many surgical scars from uhhh surgery as a kid and I wish the body positivity movement would be more accepting of people with scars. Throughout my childhood grown ass people would stare at my scars when I wore swimsuits. It was fuckin creepy and violating. I understand acceptance of people who are thicker than others due to genetics but I don’t understand acceptance of people clearly killing themselves by being deliberately unhealthy through accepting obesity. That should be helped through therapy and diet specialists. Not bOdY pOsItivItY
"Fat acceptance movement is bullshit. Like a smoker with the black lung is “healthy”. Not everyone is healthy and definitely not at all shapes and sizes. As in shapes, I mean body dysmorphia due to morbid obesity. If your a fat cow who can’t walk a mile without having a stroke, you are unhealthy and need to change your lifestyle if you want to live longer."
Oh hey this opinion again. Like what even is rule 8 anyway lol
"I like to promote body positivity and acceptance,  but it’s true that I don’t feel it because it’s never the “right kind” of positivity. I definitely see it, but it’s rare. 

Sure, love yourself because you are bigger than most other girls. But I never see love for the people with scars, disabilities, severe body acne, and any other things deemed imperfect. It gets even worse when you get into the gay community, as well."
"The 'big is beautiful' campaign is absolutely disgusting. It promotes increaded chance of heart disease, diabetes, strokes, and many more medical complications. *Yes*, some people have a worse metabolism. *No*, that is not an excuse for obesity. It simply means they need to put more effort in to staying healthy. I personally lost 15kg (33lbs) in 6 months after realising I was (mildly) overweight, getting disgusted with my appearance, and subsequently *doing* something about it.

I get really bad eczema on my face (in a way similar to Lupus), and have a slightly pronounced chin. I used to get horrendously bullied for my appearance, to the extent of being diagnosed with PTSD as a direct result. Body positivity promotion should *absolutely* be a thing, though it should *not* be laundered by these obesity proponents."
SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK. body positivity is about things that are not in YOUR control. Being fat is not out of out of your control
"I read once that encouraging someone who’s overweight to be themselves and do whatever feels best, would be equivalent to telling a drug addict to be themselves and do whatever feels best. They are both unhealthy lifestyles most of the time and need to seek for help."
In a perfect world everyone would be average weight and healthy but thats not the case. I dont think be positive about your body when you are like 20 pounds overweight is bad but then you have these 400 bound behemoth of ladies saying that people telling them to eat healthier are offensive.
"I'm a vain fat girl, can confirm I guess"
"Yeah, this doesn’t work like it used to"
"I agree with this, honestly bravo. Enjoying cake etc is fine, but there comes a point where these individuals are honestly just looking for some sort of excuse to allow them to justify their unhealthiness. It angers me oh so very much to see this all over social media & how it can be normalised so easily."
"Unpopular opinion is actually popular.

Any gathering of more than two people is easily as risk from being taken over.
We can even see it happen in internet culture, it happened happened with incels or r/The_Donald.

They all got taken over and the original purpose was lost in translation.

People need to stop being complacent when it comes to a movement or ideology and stick to their guns and not let the message warp to pieces."
NOT THE GIRL WHO LIKES CAKE LMFAO
"Totally agree with you. I’m a typically thin and curvy girl but I still hate my body, and I have a skin condition, and I feel very ostracised by the movement"
"Scars tell a story of a person's life, and are beautiful. Obviously not the dumb ones people cut into themselves as teenagers for attention but you know what I mean lol"
"Personally, I’ve been someone who’s been a little big for a long time. I feel like the body positivity movement just isn’t being utilised in the way it should. I’ve developed body dysmorphia and end up crying in front of the mirror because I don’t even want to go outside for people to look at me. I think if It was a way to help people through things like weight loss/gain and helping those with eating disorders and body dysmorphia, it’d be a lot better."
>Convincing that it was made by Glacial Gang™
"I lost my brother to CF five years ago. I know what CF does to person and im sorry that you have to go through that. You will ALWAYS have my support. 

However, I believe we shouldn't gatekeep people trying to feel better about themselves. A lot of times obesity is brought on by depression, it certainly was in my case. Maybe, if we allow them to feel better about themselves they can start feeling good enough to make changes to their lifestyle to become more healthy."
"Just look at Adele, she lost weight for her OWN reasons because it’s her OWN body. Yet all these femenazi whales are complaining and bitching that she went to the “other side.” Whatever happened to “my body my choice?” Its all fucking vanity, they wanna feel special for making poor life decisions and want the world to give them medals for being “brave” for making an ugly Instagram post. I’m so sick and tired of pure movements or ideas being politicized and turned inside out for internet points and gratification.

Edit: if you feel “betrayed” for something a celebrity does YOU ARE THE PROBLEM! Stop worshipping FLAWED human fucking beings. Stop glorifying VANITY FOR VANITIES SAKE. Your life is so shitty that you formulate an identity on shitty things, work on your self why don’t you and practice healthy mental habits."
"I agree it should be for everyone and that anyone who is majorly unhealthy should smarten up. But, some people are overweight due to health complications like PCOS. These people deserve body positivity too. I think the general message of the movement is including everyone. The obese people telling themselves everything’s fine are just the extremist of the movement imo."
"Every year 2.8M people die of complications from being overweight. That’s a staggering number for something people are trying to ‘celebrate’.

"My brother has cf and I have struggled with my own body confidence because I was covered in scars, been clean a good few years and have just started wearing short shorts!  The 'body positive movement' is patronising. It allows people who don't take care of their bodies to carry on not looking after their bodies whether they're too fat or skinny. And it's only for them people. It's not for people who have more than just a weight issue."
"I have skin issues myself, and it makes me insecure. I do wish this body positive movement would speak up more on other body issues and not just weight."
"Yep. The movement was actually started for the sole purpose of loving your “flawed” body. Whether it was scarring, vitiligo, missing limbs, etc. It was then hijacked by the fat community, then hijacked even more so that it only includes obese women. Not only that, but this movement puts bigger women into different categories. For example, small fats (size 16-20), medium fats (size 22-24), all the way to death fats. And small fats can’t speak over big fats because big fats are more marginalized. They have all these bullshit rules that if you don’t abide by you get crucified! It’s so sick and super toxic. And the shit they say about thinner people is so horrible. I’m a bigger women (size 18-20) myself, and I think it’s gone waaaaaaay too far in the wrong direction. Health at every size is super bogus, and I would love to see the movement switch back to what it originally was. I know this sounds kinda heated, but I do not hate morbidly obese people, specifically women. I’m all for loving yourself and your body as is. In fact, I do not believe that what you look like determines your worth. At all! But, if you feel like getting healthy and losing some weight, then hell yeah I’m going to cheer you on. You are then on a road to becoming healthier, undoubtedly happier, and a longer life. God forbid you mention “diet culture” to the current subscribers of the body positive movement. They will eat you alive, literally."
Yeah and if sucks because we do need to approach fatness as a body issue but in a different way. I yo yo in weight every years. From 170-200. I look very fit at 170 and at 200 I’m a thicc boy. I used to be disgusted with myself even at 175 pounds. If I didn’t have my 4 pack showing I felt bad about myself (gave up on the 6 pack. Had it for like two months and couldn’t sustain the lifestyle). But I fucking love food. Now I’m finally at this point where as long as I’m eating healthy I don’t care at all what my weight is or if I have a slight dad bod. I’m super comfortable with myself. I like being in shape but it’s literally such a silly thing to bring yourself down over if you are a little chubby... any time it gets to a bad point it needs to be addressed as a health issue. If I hit 230 pounds I would hope my friends and family would step in to make me aware and help.
"My hands are scarred and calloused from psoriasis. I was told I don't fit in, because I'm ""not fat enough"". I thought the movement was for body positivity, not fat positivity."
"Or to discuss weight in a healthy way. I actually agree with the original concept of the movement. People shouldn’t be treated poorly for being overweight. It’s not right to deny someone access to resources, be cruel to them, etc, because they’ve made some mistakes and have ended up overweight. Theres a million reasons people end up overweight and without knowing someone’s story, you shouldn’t assume they just are weak or stupid or whatever.

But it became this huge circle jerk of people telling each other everything they were doing was alright, that no change was needed, that they were healthy. That’s ridiculous. You’re not healthy Sheila you can barely stand. 

If the body positivity movement were a little more productive (and I agree a lot more inclusive of people with disabilities, dysmorphia, critically underweight people, etc) then it would be a great thing. Just spiraled our Cuz it was founded in the heart of third wave feminism."
Hahaha. Now I'll allways think of Homer Simpsons body fat movement when I think of any movement.
"Witnessing this first hand myself. 

When I mention cico and other modern mindsets I have to do it VERY carefully. Never mind that it's essentially fucking physics and based in the laws of thermodynamics and chemistry. 

There is no magic happening here, just a bunch of chemical reactions, you can control the inputs to those reactions significantly."

Ok you made me spit up my water."
"Just dawned on me, it's always ladies.

Problem is when obesity, and unhealthy behaviors get justified through this movement."
Yup. And if you don't find people with said lifestyle attractive you're 'fatphobic' apparently.
I feel like you guys should take back control and start the body acceptance movement.
"I am slightly fat (and currently working on it, wanna get thinner) but never ever have I even thought of taking some movement as an excuse. I don't feel good in my body and I can hardly believe that anyone who is fat really does.

Some things can't be changed but being overweight can be changed and i think it is stupid to not do that just because there is a movement saying you don't need to."
The movement is more of a bowel movement than a get up and take action movement
And in the same breath they'll tell you smoking is bad (probably only because it suppresses appetite)
"Thank you, I just didn't want it to be too short, its my first time here"
Automod removes your post if it's not long enough
The original post was just fine.
Ima gonna disagree with you. That was a pretty succinct argument. And I fully agree with it
"Being fat is shit for your health and shit for your quality of life. People who are fat know this. I speak as a former morbidly obese person. Nobody would choose to be fat. A lot of things can change your eating habits, depression being chief one among them. So now we have a bunch of depressed people with bodies they are being pushed to hate even more than they already do. That is why body-positivity is important for us. Self hate is not exactly a fertile ground for progress to occur, we need to feel like we're people. This movement does not say that it is totally healthy for anyone to be fat or that it doesn't suck. All it does is says it's OK. That's my take on it."
"Poor self care can be a symptom of mental or physical health issues. E.g. I used to have huge issues with picking my skin and scalp because of body dysmorphia and anxiety. Does that mean that my scarring/hair loss is unacceptable, because to do so ""justifies poor self-care decisions""?  


Also since I've recovered from anorexia I'm in the normal weight category, but (as is really common in anorexia recovery) most of the weight has initially gone to my stomach because it hasn't re-distributed properly yet. Some people might judge my stomach as a lack of fitness and so ""poor self-care"". It's not a ""natural imperfection"" because I caused it by eating more, so does that mean I can't celebrate my recovery body?  


Every comment in this thread feels hugely over-simplified and seems to be locking people out of the body positive movement, which is kinda ironic because being locked out is exactly what people are complaining about."
Don’t be pedantic. The OP was perfectly fine.
"You talk like kind of a dick bag, huh?"
"100% Self hate and stigma do not make anything better. More likely you get trapped in cyclical punishing diets that cause weight gain, end up with an eating disorder, or are just too miserable to find the motivation. These only make health worse."
"Absolutely. Wanting to change yourself because of self-loath rarely turns out successful. Learn to like yourself and then change for your own benefit. Fat positivity is stupid in a way, but so is fat-shaming"
"I think the issue is that the overall Body Positivity movement is often conflated with the Healthy at Any Size movement. Body Positivity is mostly beneficial. Healthy at Any Size, however is based on self-destruction, and willful ignorance of science, nutrition, and health. Love yourself no matter what, but *treat* yourself like you love yourself. If you wouldn't abuse anyone else you love, don't abuse yourself.


For those of you who might disagree with my assessment of HaAS, let me ask you this: if there were a movement called ""Healthy at Any Blood-Alcohol Level"" devoted to spreading awareness that being a *functional* alcoholic was not only healthy, but beneficial in many ways, what would your first reaction be? That reaction is what a lot people feel when they hear about HaAS. It's the reasonable reaction to learning about a group of people ignoring science and glorifying their addiction."
"True, but there's a lot of ""I'm never gonna change and you're oppressing me by saying that obesity isn't healthy"" - they are not learning to love themselves and then taking care of their bodies. There are many who are in pain and who have terrible health but are determined to not change. If you believe those people are out there take a stroll through r/fatlogic It's not nearly as toxic as some make it out to be, and lately there's been an increase in screenshots of people who claim that ""diet culture"" and ""fatphobia"" is really just racism.

In short, it would be great if these folks took the idea of loving oneself to mean taking care of oneself and getting healthy, but they seem to largely use ""body positivity"" as an excuse to continue to be unhealthy and to be super shitty towards anyone smaller than themself"
Fat acceptance is acceptable so far as treating them politely and seeing them as human beings. Where it get unacceptable is needing to adjust to requirements that don't help us or them or enabling them to continue destroying their bodies if they can help it. I maintain that overeating is not loving your body.
This is exactly it. I went from overweight to a healthy weight with positive diet changes and exercise; but I still have the mindset that I’m overweight and I still hate my body. I lost weight with the mentality of “I fucking hate looking at myself” and that mentality never left.
"I do agree, but i think it keeps it too much on the surfac as well. A lot of us just end up using food to deal with stress. I had to learn that's what i was doing. I think that's why everybody should be exercising regardless what they think of it. It helps releas stress and helps your body. It's also extremely mentally taxing. I think therapy can help a lot, especially if they're not necessarily sure why we eat so much."
"Right, the problem with the body positivity community thought, is that it's most often seen as a bad thing to encourage the second step you mention: diet and exercise. It has been warped into something where obesity should be considered just as desirable as anything else despite the fact that it's a chronic health condition."
"Medical research shows that weight stigma and shame-based attitudes about weight tend to reduce the effectiveness of weight loss interventions.  It turns out that when people are made to feel like they have dignity and worth, they are less likely to relapse with bad eating habits and more likely to seek out weight loss interventions.  

This is the actual value of a body positive outlook, and the same is true for people who are underweight due to varying medical conditions.

Losing
Post a picture of yourself with this comment
"That's the bad part of it for sure. If you're overweight you should be able to be happy and confident and not insulted, but you shouldn't ignore the health implications or think that being overweight is something to aspire to."
"I think there are very, very few people who genuinely believe that being obese is healthy, and even fewer who are proud of being obese. 

But being ashamed of your unhealthy body doesn’t generally help people lose weight. If it did there wouldn’t be nearly as many obese people. Change on the scale of losing maybe half your body weight takes such a massive amount of effort and commitment, and being in the right head space is so important. You have to have belief that you can do this monumentally difficult thing. And that belief would be non-existent if your main feeling about yourself is shame. Hence the body positivity movement. It isn’t about making people believe being obese is healthy, it’s about trying to move their mindset to a more positive one where effecting change seems possible."
"Act like you give a shit. Just say ""I think fat people are gross."" That's a lot shorter than feigning some interest in their health."
Yes
For sure!!! Nothing wrong with being slightly over weight and a bit chubby. When we are talking seriously obese it’s not ok and shouldn’t be encouraged.
"Yeah, such an unpopular opinion wow"
"With the same replies every time. It's basically a free Karma generator. Which is why it's not an ""unpopular opinion""."
"Reddit is once again hating fat people, no fucking surprise but always weird since I know there’s a bunch of fat neck beads here"
"I just decided to post it after trying to find a support group for people with disfigurement and injuries, and all I see is girls with no self control, complaining that fat phobia is a thing"
It’s neither new nor unpopular
"Yeah, it's so unpopular and edgy that I see it fuckin' weekly."
"> but I do agree that there should be a distinction between body positivity and body complacency

This is a great way to put it. There's nothing wrong with loving yourself, as long as you're able to also be honest with yourself, identify your issues, and work to correct them."
"Yes! Body positivity is great, but fat/size acceptance is a thing as well. Assuming someone who is fat wants to lose weight or always assuming someone who is skinny is more healthy or valued is dead wrong. A person's weight isn't a problem until that person says it is, and piling on is just cruel.


Losing weight is not necessarily healthy, and people shouldn't assume someone who is losing weight is ""doing better"" for themselves, as anorexia and illness sometimes at play. Some bodies are just bigger than others, and it's no one else's business.

If a person gets fat because they're eating poorly, so what? Do people feel morally outraged or shame smokers, cutters, sedentary people or drug addicts in the same way? Absolutely not.


It all ties back to the male gaze, and it's gross. Somehow fat is equated with being ugly? It isn't the fat person's job to look ""more attractive"" for stupid jerks on the internet, it's the job of stupid jerks on the internet to get the fuck over it. All most people need to do is stop equating being thin with attractiveness and it's all suddenly obvious why this is so messed up.

Unless someone is their lover or doctor, commenting on another person's body is not OK and it shouldn't be normalized even for ""health"" reasons.

Sorry for the novel and/or being internet loud but I'm just putting this here for someone who needs to see it, as I feel this sub can be a breeding ground for fat hate posts."
"Oh I'm not saying that, but I'm talking about the movement in general"
">the movement is too focused on larger woman when it should be much broader

Maybe in online circlejerks like Reddit and the media where controversy gets more views.

https://thebodypositive.org/

Is the first result when I Google body positive. There's no focus on women and no mention of weight or obesity at all.

The idea that the body positive movement is too focused on obese women is a strawman built by people who just want to shit on fat people constantly. It looks like the movement is too focused on overweight women specifically because this subreddit choses to insist that's the case every single day, and because it's far easier to stir up controversy by featuring fat acceptance activists in the media than people who are actually working on body positivity in general.

People always cite these nobody activists that no-one has ever heard of. But the biggest name in body positivity in the UK is probably Katie Piper who was horrifically scarred from an acid attack, it's not someone who is overweight."
I would be too
"Yup,"
"Exactly, being unhealthy doesn’t mean that they are unworthy of respect."
I believe the issue isn't that obese people are a part of the movement but that they are the whole movement. I agree with this. The body positive movement shouldn't just be about women with weight issue. The body positive movement has become a joke.
"Im going to give an example. My mother.

My mum is, and always has been, beautiful. Model beautiful. Ad campaigns for known international brands, been in everything for national rag mags to vogue. Her whole life she was thin, she stayed on a strict diet and exercised several times a week. Nothing obsessive, but she took care of herself.

My mum has always struggled with depression. After her divorce, she hit a bad patch and was given a diagnosis. She was put on medication, and honestly, she has never been so balanced and stable in all her life. Things are just going her way. Its great to see, she's doing amazing.

But. The meds made her put on *a lot of weight*. She stopped dressing up. She didn't like pictures being taken of her. It fucked up her self esteem massively. She's stricter with her diet than she was before, and she exercises more than she did before, but it doesn't matter. It won't budge. And there's not a fucking piece of cake in sight. 

She deserves to be proud of herself, of how far she has come, of all the effort she's put into losing a couple of kilos. She deserves to feel beautiful. And fuck you for saying otherwise. 


On to example number two.

A friend of mine was a gym rat who was real, real skinny. Exercise became her passion, and she decided to train to become a PT. She passed, and was chuffed. Hadn't switched careers just yet though, because she found out she was expecting. She was over the moon.

But the pregnancy was tough on her. She was on bed rest for months on end, and it got her down. The kilos started to creep up, but she comforted herself thinking she would go back hard when the baby was born and she'd those kilos. She had the motivation. She had the knowledge. And she absolutely loved working out.

After her daughter was born, she was diagnosed with sjogrens, as well as a host of other autoimmune diseases. Doctors told her that in a couple of years she might be in a wheelchair. That hit her pretty hard. She was in a lot of pain and ended up doing chemo and physiotherapy, but it didn't help. The kilos kept coming and coming and coming. This time, yes, a but of cake was involved. But she was sinking. She was then put on cortisone, and everything just.... swelled up. Hojestly, the month that went by when I didn't see her from one time to the next was a shock. She looked totally different.

She stopped taking pictures. She stopped leaving the house. She fell into depression. Recently she decided to pull herself up out of her funk and hired a personal trainer. She decided to empower herself by taking pictures with her kids again and allowing them to be seen online. She just wanted to feel worthwhile, and this was part of her journey back to herself.


But of course, you don't consider this shit when you see an overweight person. You just think it must be cake. Fuck her for wanting to feel good about herself, she should be ashamed. She should go through life hiding in the shadows because of judgement you want to pass on her. 

You get one life to live let these people live their lives. Why don't you spend some time focusing on your own life and leave these peoppe alone."
Thank you so much. I have never understood why so many on Reddit believes that being fat makes someone a bad or lazy person or that their weight is anyone else’s business. It’s like they genuinely believe making others feel bad is a public service or something. Who raised them? If you don’t have anything nice to say...
Honestly you could probably post this opinion on this sub and it would probably be unpopular since so many people here hate fat people
"Agreed, I keep trying to explain how the body positivity movement is about self love regardless of how you look. But this sub and a lot of people in real life just point at the bad actors in the movement and then decide it's all shit and so that gives them permission to shit all over fat people.

Apparently basic empathy is too difficult.

I see the same circlejerk with feminism, it's absurd."
"This. Just let other people live their lives without judging them. You don't know shit about someone by just looking at them, even if they're fat. What's broken inside of you that you're trying to fix by shitting on other humans who are trying to feel good about themselves?"
and people will go out of their way to pass judgement on larger people on entirely unrelated posts.
"First I agreed with OP, but your comment made me realize, that OP is part of the problem he fights."
"I was glad to see you make this comment. I agree. There are lots of reasons people can be obese. Self-acceptance is important. It's just too easy to deem being overweight simple a health issue (although it certainly is), and to blithely ignore the actual feelings and experiences some people have."
"Thank you for posting this. This sub is so nasty and hateful and people like OP doesn’t even know what they’re talking about. 

I’d rather be around a fat person than someone who is fat phobic. This post says more about OP and the people who are climbing over themselves to agree than the people they’re talking about. People need to mind their own fucking business."
"Thank you! I don’t understand why people on Reddit hate fat people so much. People on this sub especially. It makes me sad honestly. Fat people are people too, they’re just bigger than you. What’s wrong with that? It’s their life. If they want to feel comfortable in their own body, then why can’t they?"
This is a fantastic comment
Sounds like OP is looking for a body positivity community that rejects fat people and glorifies those who self harmed. In judging fat girls as vain for not hating themselves this person needs a lot of work on self acceptance
"Alright a more blunt term, fatass"
This sounds like a different thing...
And then judges you on your height or any other characteristic out of your control
This!
"For what it's worth, here, take my upvote"
“Thyroid issues” are not only exceedingly rare but almost always account for a difference of around 200 or so calories a day—so like half of a Starbucks drink.
"I choose to be fat. I like my body. But I don't think I I should be held up as an inspiration or goal. People need to understand that health impact on their lifestyle choices... But do you think everyone who smokes or has a dangerous hobby is a whore or son of a bitch? Get some perspective. No one is telling you you have to be fat or be attracted to fat people or pretend it's not unhealthy (well, some are, but they're a separate issue). Why do you feel the need to throw insults just because I don't take as good care of my body as other people? It's my body."
"Oh I'm talking the ones who eat soo much they have an ambiguous amount of chins, they can eat shit and die in that order"
So you can't help being skinny but you can help being fat? Give me a break.

Yea they are greedy about it
"I agree with some of what OP said.  I’m not fat, but I have a facial deformity.  Basically, my right eye is almost completely paralyzed, making my face somewhat asymmetrical.  It’s congenital.

Growing up, the only people I saw on TV with two eyes that look different were evil people—in cartoons especially, having an eye patch or something asymmetrical about your face is a stand-in for being evil or bad. 

I’m down with all the pretty fat ladies who want to be in the body acceptance movement, but they also need to make room at the table for us “ugly” folks.  I started following some of them (probably the wrong people), and I was just really turned off about how much of it was just about weight and not dieting. 

Most of the popular ones are also really pretty, just fat—I think there’s some ableism there.  It reminds me of those Dove ads with gorgeous women who have vitiligo or something, but are otherwise model pretty.

ETA:  I just saw some of OPs other comments—yikes!"
Yeah but they’re taking up four.

"A lot of the ""unpopular opinions"" just seem like ""immature opinions"".  So it's definitely an unpopular opinion among certain Redditors.  But this group seems like more of a circlejerk so it won't be unpopular within the subreddit itself."
"Yes, that's a good point,plus if anything a re branding of body positivity will help improve humanity"
It's not easy if you're having eating disorder or any other disease.
You’re being downvoted for giving your experience after being fat and then losing weight and being happier about it. I wonder who would downvote that....huh.
"Doctors are trying to help you get healthy because being obese puts a ton of unnecessary stress on your body and organs. You don’t need to go on some insane diet and torture yourself. If you make healthier choices and portion your meals correctly, you will lose weight. There are a lot of resources to help you physically and mentally with the obstacles you’re dealing with."
"Exactly! I believe the movement had great intentions. As a person with surgical scars I should be latching onto this movement for acceptance and confidence. But, I can’t when the movement preaches unhealthy eating habits and acceptance of obesity. Would you tell someone with anorexia to keep starving themselves because body acceptance? No. You’d tell them to reach out for help, meet with a diet specialist, find therapy, etc. (A lot of my friends and myself suffered from eating disorders like anorexia so I’m not talking outta my ass.) Same thing should be told to people who are unhealthily overweight and affected by eating disorders and low self esteem. It’s a mental issue with physical consequences that can lead to death. The acceptance is terrifying. Especially since eating disorders and obesity are some the top leading causes for death."

"It's come up every week for the last 5 years.

"Agreed! I have bad acne scarring and still see no representation, everyones body also always seem so perfect. Hairless, almost poreless and no blemishes."
Also don't forget such an important issue as shaved armpits. We live in the age of cringe. Where there is no room for a thoughtful reflection.
"The body positive movement isnt a fucking organisation with a central control, YOU are the movement just as much as any one else. If no one is speaking up about skin issues (which I doubt, I think it just more that overweight people get far more focus because OCs like this one likes to trash on them) then you are just as responsible to start talking about it as anyone else. 

Any movement isnt like santa where one can just hope that at one point one will be given something from it and that its just a waiting game untill then. A movement is something one must join to influence it to include that which one believe it should include. 

Go on twitter and tweet something about your skin condition with a relevant hashtag (dunno what it is now) and I promise you that most people that are body positive about weight will also be positive about your issue."
It has to start somewhere
"I am
Covered in scars from multiple spinal fusions and severe reactive eczema. I am sorry."
I completely agree with you. I'm a size 16 and once I commented on some positivity shit and they told me I don't understand what's its like because size 16 isn't that big. Like bitch at my heaviest I was a 24. I worked hard to get down and my goal is a 14. What happened to accepting everyone!?
"They are so toxic toward women who aren't ""flawed"" too. I really liked the body positive movement even though my body has always been thin, because I think it's ridiculous to judge people by their bodies and everyone should be happy with who they are. But now a lot of these women aren't accepting of my body and assume all sorts of things about my character. It sucks because they aren't really universally accepting."
"I think you're point of view takes all the positives of OP's and cuts out the insults. I'm completely behind this, go you!

Edit: I take it back I didn't see the last sentence."
"Completely agree with everything save one point; your look determining your worth.  I wish it wasn't true, but it is, and there isn't much we can do about it as a society, because it's instinctual.

When we see an obese person, our brains **implicitly know** that it's not the way that person should look under normal circumstances.  Even little kids who haven't learned the ways of judgmental society will be curious or even nervous around an obese person.  For adults, it's way worse, because we understand more about how the world works, and what it takes to ""get your shit together"" and survive.  If I see a morbidly obese person, I can assume (not necessarily correctly) that they have - in general - less structure and discipline in their life.  They don't exercise as much as they should.  They don't control their food intake as much as they should.  They don't stay on top of their issues and confront them as much as they should.  Whether it be fear, or laziness, or depression, they are not living up to the standard that provides a normal-sized body.

And if they aren't doing those things for themselves, how can I trust them to do those things for my company, or for my marriage, or for my friendship?

Now, on the other hand, show me an obese person who's actively taking aggressive action to thin down and become healthy.  I'll hire that person in a second, marry that person in a second, be friends with that person in a second.  They are showing the rest of society ""hey, I fucked up.  But I know I fucked up, and I'm working on fixing my mistakes.""  That is awesome and inspiring.


P.S. ""They will eat you alive, literally."" is a crowning-achievement-level burn!"
This sounds like something from a fiction book that I would read. It’s not that I don’t believe you but it would fit perfectly into a sci-fi .
"It is, your just looking in the wrong places. Social media is an echo chamber, and one you find something that reinforces your beliefs, it's all you'll ever see"
"""Hehe, look at that blubber fly!"""
"Yeah, now you just sound like a mean and bitter asshole."
"You lose all credibility when you say ""whales"". I did think you have a point, but now I just think you're bitter that people large than you have more body confidence. Attacking them won't make you feel better."
"Comments like this are exactly why the body positivity movement exists the way it does. Obviously it's wrong to pretend it's healthy to be obese, or that people don't have control of their weight.

But you have to look at the wider social context. Fat people, women in particular, get treated like shit. You probably wouldn't use casual racial or homophobic slurs, and if you did you'd get downvoted to hell. But you can call fat women ""whales"" all you like.

If you want the body positivity movement to change, the best thing you can do is stop being a bully.

"We'll cut it down for the repost, see you in 6 months."
"People generally spend zero seconds actually thinking what things like body positivity or toxic masculinity or white privilege and things like that actually stand for. No one thrives in an environment of hostility. I've been obese my whole life and bullying has changed nothing of that. If anything, it has SUBSTANTIALLY inhibited my personal growth. Now that I feel more positive, I feel more in control. This makes me more capable to change. 

Stay positive, fellow fatties!

EDIT: In other words: I am not fat; I have fat. Fat is not my identity. I know it has negative health effects and I know it is not attractive. I also know I am not defined by my fatness. I have a job, I have interest, I have my own personality. And while I work on my fatness, I am allowed to be positive, no matter what my body looks like."
"> A lot of things can change

Yeah, but I mean, that's exactly the point. Things don't change, **you change** your habits. Too passive. You refuse to take responsibility and you want to compare yourself to people who weren't responsible, who had no choice. 

There's a false perspective that unhealthiness happens to you. And that is a lie. You are people, but you are people making choices. You are not in the same group as people who cannot choose their way out of their physical condition. Sorry, you're not a victim. Do you deserve empathy, sure. But you made choices to get where you are. You don't deserve the same sympathy as people who didn't have a choice

Edit: One last shot, a c-section scar and a tummy tuck scar can look very similar. But for someone who got a tuck to say ""Well, we are all in the same position because we all have scars"" to compare their procedure to a c-section is absurd and shameful. They are not even the same ballpark"
"It's true that shaming them for their situation certainly isn't going to help them overcome their situation. However...

> This movement does not say that it is totally healthy for anyone to be fat or that it doesn't suck. All it does is says it's OK.

This isn't entirely true. The *'Healthy at Every Size'* sub-group of the Body Positivity movement most definitely has made those claims. Now of course they don't represent the entirety of the group (if we're even talking about clearly defined groups to start with), but it is one of the ideas that falls under the same umbrella."
"Exactly. Insulting and bullying people doesn’t encourage them to get skinny, rather tends to lead people to get fatter. Only genuine compassion can lead to improvement in that way, not just calling people lazy for being fat."
"I couldn't have put it better. The body positive movement is not about celebrating being unhealthy or looking different, it's about learning to love yourself for who you are instead of living every day ashamed of yourself and hating your existence. You can learn to love your body and work towards a healthier life and body at the same time. The two can co-exist. Anyone who thinks it is a celebration of being unhealthy is completely missing the point."
"I agree that it’s not productive to hate your body. 

But my guess is that there is a large overlap in the body acceptance movement and the heathy at any size movement."
"If it is seen as a standard of beauty you are not only in danger of people accepting their shape and risking their own health, but encouraging others to aim to reach it. It isn't necessary to shame or abuse people, but at the very least people should be told plainly that is not some form of goal and is in fact dangerous and unhealthy."
"I just wrote a similar comment - body positivity is not the same as healthy at every size.

Body positivity is a GOOD thing for everyone - none of us should feel sh\*t about how we look. And if you're overweight you're more likely to change for positive reasons than for negative ones like shame and guilt. HAES is a totally different ballgame, which completely denies the scientific evidence and encourages people to develop unhealthy and dangerous habits."
"There's also a difference between being overweight and obese. I'd say that it's perfectly fine for overweight people to be comfortable with their bodies, but obesity always needs to be addressed"
"if you want to ignore the health implications, i think that's ok for a person on the heavier side to do. live how you want to live, whatever makes you happy. just dont drag other people down with you by saying it is a healthy lifestyle, and then encourage others to become obese"
This needs more upvotes

Why is it dependant on wanting to change yourself? I know I would be healthier if I lost weight, but I don't think I would be happier. I do the bare minimum of excercise so I can still do all the things I want to do (go walking all day or go climbing or swimming) and I eat healthy meals, but don't portion control and have lots of snacks. As long as I know the health implications and don't hold myself up as a positive example to other people, why should I be expected to work on myself?"
"Well like it or not, there are a lot of obese people in the world. Certainly a lot more than disabled or disfigured people. Are the obese people excluding or gatekeeping? If not, then so be it."
"This post is only raging on fat women btw, maybe reddit hates an obese manchild too but i rarely see it...OP is worried about women feeling too positive lmao"
"These people love to pretend that they are concerned for the ""health"" of overweight people. Yet you never see them even attempt to acknowledge the mental health aspects as to why people gain weight. Moreover, of course they don't seem to care or be as vocal about people smoking, drinking alcohol, eating excessive amounts of unhealthy food. It's so blatantly obvious that they just hate fat people."
"OP is projecting their insecurities upon fat people, and fat girls in particular. They are blaming others for their inability to build confidence, that's all I see."
You are so fucking rude
"Welcome to unpopularopinion, where all opinions are shitty and unpopular for a reason and the arguments are made in bad faith and not even relevant to the actual point."
Thanks lol
So you get to choose how fat is too fat?
"That's not exactly true.  Most of these people hide behind 'genetics'.  But no, it's the 20 chocolate chip cookies they're stuffing in their face while not moving.  Only like .01% of the population actually has a genetic issue that makes it harder to lose weight."
"Sorry but you're going to have to explain to me how those people manage to circumvent the whole ""calories in vs calories out"" balance. Either you eat less or exercise more, and both are your choice."
"Fair enough, I appreciate your respectful perspective"
"To be honest it is never easy. Ever. Maybe when you’re 18 but as you age it just gets harder and harder.

If I didn’t have self loathing I never would have changed. Shit just look at my post history and you’ll see how dark of a place I was in. My friend shamed me, them dragged me to the gym. It sacked, but it changed my life.

I just needed someone to shove me out of my own pit of despair.

Do I still struggle with some issues? Of course. However things have overwhelmingly improved for me over the last few months, and I’ve dropped a lot of weight.

This was too going to happen if I sat there and listened to the people telling me it was all okay."
"Nobody claims it's easy.

It is very very difficult to lose weight but very very worth it."
And also if you're like constantly getting shamed for what you look like. It can take a huge toll on you
"Lol, they never said they were happier."
"People don't need movements to feel good about themselves. You can't gain confidence  through the approval and acceptance of other people. 

I think the overweight people involved in the body positive stuff aren't genuine at all, they still hate their bodies, because if they didn't they wouldn't be so desperately seeking the approval of society.

Thats one of the biggest problems we face as human beings right now is that we seek our self confidence and self worth through the approval of others.  All I'm saying is, no one needs movements.  Everyone eventually finds their solid core of people who love and accept them the way they are, so why do they need the whole of society to love and accept them too?"
Ah word.
It's all fake. Everyone should check /r/instagramreality regularly.
I (25F) have a hormonal imbalance causing me to grow a lot of body hair. I can attest to the hairless bodies everyone has.
"This. I have bad acne scarring all over the upper half of my back, my upper chest, and my upper arms, and I can barely even bring my self to wear a t-shirt around my own family and my closest friends, much less a tank top or swimsuit. Yet, as you said, everyone else always looks perfect."
"I struggle with this every day. My back is covered shoulders to butt in acre scars, and on top of it I have a big port wine stain right in the middle of all the scarring. I always wish people like me were more visible, I’ve spent my entire adult life scared of going to the beach."
"Skin is actually a big deal for me. They are only just barely trying to represent those with vitiligo, which is great but not enough. Acne is so common and it's still made out to be a joke, I still get it, and it really can ruin one's confidence. My skin is awful and there is so little I can do that will help it. I've been dealing with acne now for most of my life and I totally understand how much it sucks."
"Same here, acne and have an ugly mole but no one likes to bring up the people who are actually afflicted by conditions outside their control."
"I never said no one is speaking up about it, just said it will be nice to see more of it. I understand where you're coming from and I agree with you for most part. 

I also unfortunately don't have the confidence to post about it but I praise who does! It's not an easy thing and I'm talking about seeing more of these people in sites and magazine. Which you do see in some! There is a swimming wear company (don't remember the name) that shows model with skin issues, disability and other physical medical issues.  

Also I don't use Twitter and 100% agree with you there, I am not doubting they aren't positive about my issue.

Edit: changed shoes to shows lol!"
"I mean it's relative to the size of supporters.

I recall people making fun of a woman on some image for ""not having breasts"" and when someone spoke out against that they got shut down with ""skinny people don't have real body image problems""."
"Deep down, no matter how deep, every fat person knows that they're in bad shape. Seeing someone else lose the weight that they're too lazy to fills them with jealousy. You should take that reaction with pride, since you're doing so well that you're now the object of someone else's jealousy. Keep up the good work!"
"I consider myself curvaceous, and I'm a bigger girl. But I have problems with my weight due to medications I'm on for depression and PTSD. I also have fibroids and cysts that contribute to my weight as well. Presently, I'm 'pregnant' with a fibroid that is the size of a five month fetus, and that's just one of the many I have.

It's incredibly reductive to dismiss people who are heavier as a result of them loving to eat cake. I'm not a fan of cake or even desserts for that matter.

I think there is room for everybody in the positive body movement without putting others down or claiming exclusivity as a fat person cause. I don't understand why people let other peoples bodies bother them so much. It's weird."
"Just to add to this, sometimes it feels like they want to control what people find attractive. I'm attracted to middle of the road size women, but I also have been attracted to women of other various sizes--and vice versa for women I assume. 

I am perfectly fine with everyone being whatever weight they want. That's great. What bothers me is when people feel entitled to have others find them attractive pretty much for just accepting their own bodies and existing. It's great you accept yourself, what I think shouldnt matter. That does not mean I have to find every woman ever born attractive. I have a type, almost everyone does, and that's reality. 

And to add one other thing to what someone else said--it's not like fat guys are deemed beautiful. They're not. If you're a fat short balding dude you might be the most widely accepted unattractive person on the planet. Theres no body acceptance movement for men. We either get fit or accept that women wont be attracted to us, because men dont have the luxury of being asked out (usually). We have to do the asking which means we had better look good doing it, and because most women know they can meet a guy who will date them or sleep with them, they can pick and choose much easier. Theres scarcity as far as men looking for women is concerned but not the other way around."
Thank you! That means a lot!
"Oh, but that last sentence."
"There's a difference between dignity and desirability, and the word worth is often used to describe both concepts.

Your appearance does not determine your dignity or inherent value as a human being. Everyone has equal value as people and physical appearance has no connection with this. A less attractive person is no less worthy of living a great life.

On the other hand, your appearance can determine your desirability. Everyone is looking for certain qualities in romantic partners, friends, or business associates, and the way you look can of course impact the degree someone else finds a relationship of any kind with you to be desirable. None of us are entitled to have any other person find us subjectively desirable, because nobody else is entitled to force us to find them subjectively desirable. To claim otherwise seems to me at least to be a massive infringement on the very dignity described above.

This may seem like a trivial point to some, but mixing the two concepts up can really be devastating to people."
"Just to talk about your point regarding instinct, you have to take into consideration ever culture when you talk about beauty standards and attractiveness. There are many that see larger women as ideal. Even white euro culture has held large women as the ideal in times of famine. The ideal attractiveness changes over time. Not everyone is instinctually attracted to skinny People. There is something to be said about a larger woman who can survive a long cold winter in times of famine while keeping a babe alive and well fed.
 
we currently live in a time of excess and so naturally the standard of beauty has swung the opposite way because now if you're skinny, it's because you're rich enough to go to the gym and healthy food. Everyone knows that poor people are the fattest in modern America. It hasn't always been that way, poor people for most of history were skinny and starving, and the rich were fat. Therefore fatness  = success, the opposite of today's skinny success"
"You know, I want to dislike everything you just said.  But it's all true. I've been lazy, afraid, depressed.  And I've created bad habits from that for decades.  You have every right to use that as a basis as to who you employ, befriend, or marry.  But it does make me sad. You could be missing out on some great people.  Ability and personality should be more important than appearance.

I admit that I regularly questions my worth and often cannot come up with any good answers.  The body positivity movement has made me feel feel worthy in some of my dark times.  But I can admit you speak more truth then I often care to admit.  Because my worth is so low, is why I've been single for over a decade, I'm stuck in a dead job for the last 5 years, and why I have no friends.  I don't bother trying anymore, because I don't blame people like you for how you feel.  I mean maybe not the friend part.  Weight shouldn't be too much of a factor in that.  

Thanks for bringing back my depression back I guess?"
"Most of the time this ""unpopular"" opinion gets posted, which is rather frequent, it's always by some bitter asshole. They really don't give a fuck about it promoting unhealthy behaviors, they're just upset it's not okay to bully fat people anymore. God forbid it isn't socially acceptable to be an absolute dick to strangers because of their weight anymore."
"Yea I are with ya. I was about to comment saying I agree to a certain extant. 

The extant being that we aren’t their doctors thus we don’t know if they are truly classified as obese nor do we know if their is any underlying health issue that prevents them from being able to maintain a healthy weight. Many models considered “plus size” in that industry are truly at a healthy weight. Not stick skinny or fit looking but also no where near obese. Also just consider or research any and all types of thyroid problems that can prevent people obtaining and maintaining healthy weights. 

But honestly, name calling like that helps no one and is just plain mean. I mean what if they simply have depression and over eat to feel better. That’s two mental disorders right their that someone who is striving for self love may suffer from and to hear any hateful words towards them is down right insensitive. 

Though I have seen my fair share of people who are truly unhealthy promoting unhealthy lifestyles and trends all in the name of self love and insta likes."
"It's pretty easy to be positive about your body when the only flaw it has could be fixed by not eating garbage, and not something that you just can't fix."
As a fat man I think I can say that
"There are many fat people who have lost *hundreds* of pounds in the course of their lives and are still fat. In some cases, *much fatter* than the first time they started dieting because they were ashamed to be overweight.

Yoyo-ing is common and a struggle against ""habits"" that are more akin to addictions like smoking. Except smokers get all kinds of support from society to quit, whether via no-smoking regulations, laws against advertising cigarettes on television and in other settings, numerous nicotine replacement products, helplines, etc. *And many of them still can't quit despite trying for decades.* For fat people, the food/alcohol is all around them. It's a lynchpin of socializing. Widely sold in caloric portions that could feed a small family. Junk food heavily outweighs healthy food in ad dollars. And especially in America, we live in a society that emphasizes processed, sugared-up, corn syrup laden food instead of cooking from scratch, which few overworked, sleep deprived and extra exhausted from being fat people have the energy, time or knowledge to do.

Now add in the human psychology of defensiveness, whereby you have total strangers giving fatties dirty looks and family constantly dumping on them for being fat, all the while generating the *opposite* emotional reaction, ""I'm angry/depressed/hurt, so now I'm going to go *eat something*"" and you've got a population of embattled people who basically just give the fuck up.

And *most* of them don't buy into the ""healthy at any size"" or ""beautiful"" bullshit. Most of them wake up every morning hating that they're fat and despising what they see in the mirror. And every week, they make a plan to lose that weight and like smokers, even if they get a good start and begin to drop the tonnage, more often than not life throws some shit at them that trips them up and makes it too easy to slide back into the lifelong rut that is really more of a trench they have to dig out of.

Except this time (and every time) they gain back *more* weight than they lost. So they hate themselves even more.

And society is happy to pile on. Fat people are perhaps the only demographic that *everyone* is allowed to openly shit all over. Every race, every religion, every age group, every political persuasion, every income level-- make fun of or openly despise fat people.

So eventually fat people don't want to leave their homes, much less go to a gym.

The proportion of fat people in America is a clear indication that something beyond ""bad habits"" has gone wrong. It's an epidemic. *Nearly half* of Americans are obese. At this percentage, any scientist can tell you it goes well beyond a *personal choice* problem. Half of a society doesn't ""choose"" to become a member of the most reviled class of humans in existence.

So if a small percentage of fat people want to find an emotional anchor that might give them the self confidence to try again one day or at least go out and *move* and not permanently inhabit their sofas, I'm not going to begrudge them that. 

But I'd add in people with scars, former fat people with skin so loose they could fit a second person in it, people with no fashion sense, people with bad teeth, people with bad (or no) hair, and well, fuck, just *people*. 

If you have a kind and generous soul, you should be considered beautiful. If you have a cruel and selfish soul, you should be considered ugly. If you're a stranger, you should be considered beautiful until you prove yourself ugly. 

Everyone should be treated with kindness and compassion. Everyone should be assumed to have a personal struggle they deal with every day. Everyone should be uplifted by society.

Jesus we could all use a little friendliness."
"I don’t mean to assume, but I’m not sure if you’ve dealt with things that make you overweight. Poor parenting lead me to have a much higher appetite than most other kids, mainly because my parents grew up in food unstable households. Not only that, but I have to deal with intense depression, in which my only coping mechanism I’ve developed over the past 5 years was food. And, to add insult to injury, the antidepressants I take lead to bigger appetite and weight gain. 

Is it a choice to a certain extent, yes. However. It’s the equivalent of being shoved in a hole, then asked why you haven’t dug out yet. It takes time, and a lot of effort. And don’t forget that this sort of belittling of fat people can lead into anorexia and bulimia, which can be far more dangerous than being overweight"
"Yeah but the HAES people are fucking deluded.   

I’m in relatively decent health for my weight. Relatively being the key word.  I am all for people feeling comfortable in their own skin but to pretend that being overweight doesn’t have ANY impact on your health is dangerous."
"I’m sure there’s extreme cases out there that do as you suggest, but I don’t think that by and large the mainstream of the BP movement is going as far as saying that being fat is so beautiful that you should aspire to it. Everything has its extremists, but I find it’s not useful to focus on that. 

And the other thing is that this stuff is reactionary: every fat person has been told repeatedly, often excessively, that they are unhealthy and unattractive. If the fat beauty message was going out into a vacuum, the risk you have identified might be significant. But with the world as it is there’s no meaningful risk of it going out to people who haven’t heard the unhealthy and dangerous message plenty."
Contrary to the people risking life and limb.
"Never said that. Being obese and stuff is definitely unhealthy but the type of dehumanization that bullies in school, the internet, etc. indulge in,  its just breeding people to end up loathing themselves and that's not healthy either. Neither of them are healthy. Its great that there are people who can improve themselves because of insults and habitual shaming but I don't think everyone is strong enough for that, and that is understandable."
"Im overweight and some people on this post are posting really insulting things. Im definitely not obese but Im overweight as I had eating issues due to my mental illness. It hurts to be called whales and stuff. That’s not encouragement, that’s insulting. People need to realise that helping people isn’t insulting them. If they really want to help someone, help them in a good way."
"Why? Because it makes you uncomfortable to look at? Or because of the health implications? People make choices that risk their own health all the time, e.g. smoking or cosmetic surgeries... As long as you are aware of the health implications, why shouldn't you be allowed to make an informed choice? I don't think it should be admired or promoted, but I don't think other people get to decide what weight I should be."
"being overweight is bad for your entire body, especially your heart, just because theres some arbitrary cutoff between overweight and obese doesnt matter. and these generally dont apply to muscular people"
"Their doctors and close one's need to address it better. But not random people. It's not everyone's business. I am clinically obese. If you knew my lifestyle, you would wonder how I got this way, but thats none of your business. I need to love me and lose weight to be healthy still, not because I hate my body. I don't owe anyone my story of why I am this size for them to look treat me like a normal person. 

I do sees OPs point. I wish that community had been what they needed. I wish it was different too with less 'stay the same' and more care of self. I just dont think you need to tear down others who are hurting to say ""Hey where is someone to lift me up?""

Edit: spelling"
"Why is overweight a term then if it's ""perfectly fine""? You're still at increased risk of health problems, you should be proportionally concerned. As your weight enters overweight you should be concerned and increasingly so as your weight goes up."
Exactly! As long as you're not pretending it's healthy.
"Honestly though I have a overweight female friend and she’s always trying to date gym junkies and they fuck her and leave. She was upset the other day because she keeps having sex, but none of them stay. I have a male friend who is overweight but he works, he bikes and tries... I showed her his picture the other day because they have a lot in common and she shut his body down.... why can’t fat people, love fat people?"
"> Why is it dependant on wanting to change yourself?

Because self-improvement is healthy. I'm not just talking about weight. Whether someone has a weight problem, or an anger problem, or a drinking problem, or an issue with procrastination, the ability to recognize the issue and take steps to correct it is a good thing. 

I'm not trying to pretend like I'm better than anyone, because I'm not. I have plenty of issues myself. For example, I've been drinking daily, to a ridiculous degree, for more years than I'd like to admit. I've realized that it's harming me, my work, and my relationships, and I've limited my drinking to weekends only, and even then in limited amounts. I'll probably quit for *good in the near future, outside of the occasional social drink. That's how it's supposed to work, and I should have done it sooner.

>and don't hold myself up as a positive example to other people...

But that's the point of this thread, because the body-positivity movement has, to some extent, been co-opted by people who *do* hold themselves up as a positive example. We're all free to do whatever we want with our lives, but it's when we pretend that our failures are a positive where things become an issue."
"Perhaps In America . Most of the world does not have an obesity problem like the states. I believe more people have skin problems than weight issues. So many people have scars, stretch marks and weight issues besides weighing too much. I'm thin and can tell you that many obese people do exclude. Not only do they exclude but many are just plain mean about it. 

Skinny shaming is real. Normally it's people that can afford to lose a few pounds that are the bullies. If I talk about my issues with weight I can guarantee that an obese person will invalidate me. Gaining weight is just as hard as losing for some people. People like me aren't represented. People like me aren't welcome either in the movement.

I think your post shines a light on the issue. That you say there are more obese people than people with disabilities or skin issues shows how poorly underrepresented others are in the body positivity movement. This shouldn't be. I'd expect our obese buddies to want everyone represented. Isn't it about everyone feeling good?"
"would hazard a guess that the same people hating on fat women for being 'unhealthy' lust after models and actresses who may push their bodies to be unhealthily slim, without any sense of irony."
"You are correct. I was more speaking generally to the comments that usually plague these types of posts.

It’s clear from OPs other comments that they have some issues and are using this shit opinion to unfairly project their own issues into another group to try and make their issues more valid. Plus he seems like a very bitter misogynist. That usually goes hand in hand with fat phobic people since people usually talk about fat women when talking about fat people.

Also OP claims to be a fat man like that gives his horrible comments more validity. So he’s self hating and needs serious help (his comments indicate he’s got some issues) or he’s lying to make this post more valid somehow. Cause you know, he’s fat therefore he is allowed to speak for other fat people."
And your fat soo we both have flaws
"Oh yeah, the people who actively do nothing to increase their health irk me. Like, they can be happy with their body and work to be healthy. I feel like the community has created the ultimatum of either being “fat” or healthy because all the healthy are kicked out the body positivity community"
Just people who pretend being obese is healthy
"Glad to hear that!

Hope my life get straight soon"
I can relate to being shamed.
"All of the body positive pages I follow on Instagram basically do what that sub Reddit does. They show you how easy it is to manipulate your appearance with lighting, posting and photo shop. It's actually been really helpful to demistify Instagram for me. So I don't know what ""fake"" body+ accounts you have seen but the ones I follow are real and raw."
"This sub keeps my standards for myself in check. I used to feel bad about my acne and my skin texture. Yeah, those flawless skin texture is all photoshop, it's just a filter that simulates skin texture. @its.shiny is a fantastic model that shows true acne acceptence on IG. Bless her"
"Oh I agree! I love instareality, but its still plastered over tv shows, every other type of media, and some people really do look like their photos etc. Some of the photos on instareality I struggle to even find the warping/smoothing which makes it even more insidious as insecure teens and others will struggle more with it."
Is it everywhere (like hands/face too) or just places you would already have hair? Hope not too personal just genuinely curious
"Same. I know how you feel dude trust me, esp someone with dark hair but paleish skin. I've given up on shaving my arms I don't care, but other places? Very conscious, spend so much of my life trying to get rid of it and then get additional scaring because of removal."
"Ah. Hello, PCOS neighbor."
Have you considered spironolactone as a treatment for that? I had severe (and I mean severe) acne around 20-23 years of age and went on that regimen because my acne was caused by a hormonal imbalance. Took it for about a year and never got such acne breakouts ever again (I’m 36 now). Apparently spironolactone helps with excessive body hair too for the same reason.
I actually follow a body+ chicky who embraces her body hair and it's wonderful to see. People complaining about not having enough representation within the movement need to look harder.
"I also have a lot of hair, idk if it’s from hormones or just genetic because my dad is haaaairrryy"
"I have really bad acne scarring on my forehead, used to cover it up with the famous 'justin bieber hair'. At some point I decided fuck it I'm not hiding it anymore and milimetered my hair. It was really liberating but scary to go outside in the first few weeks. After a while you don't care anymore and you get self esteem because of it. If you ever wanna talk about it my PM is open!"
"I follow on Instagram a user called @peterdevito who posts beautiful pictures of people with acne scars/acne and more, it’s a great body positive account to follow if you’re looking for a body positive account that is about skin :)"
"Same! its on my cheeks mostly, I have it on my chest and then I have bad keloid acne on my back that is basically never gonna get healed essentially. Its taken me a while but I feel like people deff don't care about my back too much, but face.. I used to have strangers coming up to me telling me how to fix my acne when shopping, wish we had face masks back then to cover it. Roaccutane is a life saver but ofc the scars remain."
">Skin is actually a big deal for me

Fuckin same. I feel the lack of skin representation hard. A lifetime of struggle with eczema has left me wary of shorts and shortsleeves thanks to the breakouts I get"
I’m a 110lb 5’8”. Everyone thinks it’s ok to walk up to me and tell me I need to gain some weight or eat a cheese burger. Yet it’s totally taboo to tell an overweight person to put down the cheese burger or that they need to lose some weight.
"It all goes both ways my dude. I am an attractive male and I cold-heartily reject many over-sized women. I have plenty of women approaching me and asking me out. This isn't a way to brag or anything, but just showing you that its not ALL like how you describe."
I didn't read that!
"I certainly agree with that, but I was more speaking about truly obese people.  I know that technically the medical definition of ""obese"" is surprisingly low.  But I'm referring to *really* large people, like the kind that make you do a double-take when you see them in public.

I know doctors consider ""dad bod"" and ""mom bod"" obese, but I think culture has pretty much decided that just counts as ""chubby"".  Obese is the guy that takes up two seats on the bus, or the lady that needs a motorized cart to get through Walmart.

Also, fascinating point about how time changes views, and how fat or skinny could be seen as good or bad depending on the circumstances of the day."
I don't think you actually read the OP
"I think you should be any weight you want, as long as you don't kid yourself that it's healthy, blame other people for your weight, or hold yourself up as a good example. If you follow those ""rules"", at the end of the day you're only hurting yourself."
Why dont you take some time to work on yourself homie? Build up that confidence
"You're even better than a unicorn, because you're real."
"You know what else you can do? Be part of the body positivity movement you wish to see.

Or you can cry about it online. Not sure which will get you more attention though."
"Only if i (a fat man in progress) can make a joke at you too.

But how is that fair, you've got a thick skin. Figuratively and literally:) :)


I get what you mean though. Before the movement we had fat and ugly people in our group and we knew they were fat and ugly, and they knew i wa short and unsymetric and noone really cared becase we are all just people and being professionally good looking was a job for some people blessed with having good looks.


Now we started to  address our ugliness and fatness and for what - it never was a big issue before. The more we talk about the more of an issue it becomes. 

A fat person is aware he's fat, no need for a movmement to remind him of that all the time."
"No, you can't say that, because ""whales"" always gets thrown at specifically fat women, so you're just being hypocritical as well as benefitting from use of specifically sexist language."
"I'm a former smoker and I QUIT. You know how I quit? By waking up one morning, coughing, feeling my lungs ache and thinking to myself, ""What am I doing to myself? Do I really want to keep feeling like this?""

So I quit. I quit because I recognized that I was using self rationalization techniques to excuse my behavior. So I did something that you supposedly have issue with: I got a craving, used my discipline, and said no. I saw them every time I went in a store, to the gas station, and at home easy sitting there to roll because someone else smokes too.

But I said NO. That's your issue. You don't know how to say no. Top this off with your delusional narcissism leading to your insistence that everyone is beautiful because you yourself are not, you have no capability to change. And that's sad.

America has a deep culture of narcissism and it shows obviously in movements such as these. Instead of accepting your flaws and accepting you have positives, everything must be a positive, nothing could POSSIBLY be negative about yourself! And any negative, with just enough lying and self delusion, can become a positive!

This isn't positivity. It's middle-class narcissism cloaked in virtue signalling nonsense.  


By the way, this is what happens when you buy into delusions and the extent of your politics is virtue signaling. You contradict yourself in three paragraphs:  


""And *most* of them don't buy into the ""healthy at any size"" or ""beautiful"" bullshit. ""  


"" If you have a kind and generous soul, you should be considered  beautiful. If you have a cruel and selfish soul, you should be  considered ugly. If you're a stranger, you should be considered  beautiful until you prove yourself ugly. """
I agree with all of this! My mom was in a relationship with an abusive man for most of my childhood and he was very controlling over what we ate. It wasn't until she finally left him that I started packing on the pounds because my mom was letting us have foods we were never aloud to while living with him. I ended up being considered obese by the time I got to high school and from there it was very hard to change the habits especially when people made me feel like I was less than for being overweight. I struggled with depression all through college and it wasn't until I graduated and was in a stable job and loving relationship that I was finally able to start making better choices for myself. I've lost 80lbs in total so far and still have a bit more to lose. So I agree that being overweight is definitely not always that persons fault and choosing to do something about it can be really hard. I'm lucky I didn't end up with an eating disorder considering some of the things I've gone through because of my weight.
"> it is a choice to a certain extent 

Yeah, that’s my fckn point. There are people who have zero, none, no choice and those with “some” choice don’t belong in the same group"
Which part of my comment is that in response to?
"exactly. and ""negative encouragement"" isn't helpful in any way. calling someone a whale under the excuse that 'it will help them realize they need to make a change' is wrong; more specifically, it's just fucking rude -.-"
"100% only health reasons. I grew up in a poor, overwhelmingly obese town and seeing the amount of people who I loved that can no longer walk properly breaks my heart. I'm not sure if my original comment came across differently, but I'm all for body positivity regarding weight, and I would never tell someone or even insinuate that they needed to lose weight. 

But at the same time, I think the movement can glorify obesity. And in my eyes, being at a weight which will drastically impede your movement, heart, and ability to breath should never be glorified. But again, I would never tell someone that they have to lose weight, but being a little chubby and being unable to stand up and touch your knees are two completely different things and should be addressed differently."
"Personally, I disagree. It costs a lot in taxes to have unhealthy people, especially obese people...

So it does impact me and others re: tax costs. 

So, I think, society does have a responsibility to keep its citizens healthy, and not obese. 

Pepple can do what they want, it is a free country, but we need to focus on healthier eating, education of nutrition, etc. In our society today. Not doing do is a disservice to everyone."
You’re costing normal people billions of dollars every year lol if you don’t think fat people affect everyone you’re at the very least a few pennies short of a dollar.  We CANNOT HAVE universal health care because of people like you and your mindset.
"Because they are trying to convince themselves they are different. Basic in-group mentality, create an “other” and then hate them to make you feel better about not being them."
"But just because self-improvement is what you want to do for yourself, you think other people are required to? Losing weight would improve my physical health, but what impact would it have on my stress levels or everyday happiness to have to restrict my diet?

I agree that some of the body positivity movement is geared towards promoting unhealthy living, and it should be more about learning to be happy and have good mental health."
"Ah. There's a troll in the dungeon

Have a nice day"
"Excalty, you'd think that someone with body positivity would want to do everything they could to actually be healthy. If you love yourself wouldn't that included looking after yourself no matter your size or ability."
"It will, just focus on the little things. I know it sounds silly but waking up earlier, going for walks, taking vitamins, getting sunlight, keeping your home clean, etc can really have an impact."
Do you have some recommendations for instagram accounts. I feel like my thread is full of pies and disappoint.
"Hirtsutism is what its called, technically everyone has body hair everywhere, but for women etc, they have noticeably less on their like chest/neck area and stomachs etc. I reckon the person was probs referencing the places that other women don't really get waxed or is seen as normal- so like in salons you'd see arms/legs/bikini/chin/eyebrows but some women grow it everywhere in between. Its usually linked to PCOS or hormone imbalances."
Having dark gross body hair everywhere and then getting ingrown hairs and scars when you try to remove it I love my life :)))))))))))))
"I dont care about self-acceptance, no man could ever love a woman who has dark black stubble growing on her face that needs daily shaving (im that woman before anyone tells me im so very mean)"
You just said something emphatically true. We’re all genetic prodigies and have absolutely no control over our genetic makeup hereditary passed down genes from our parents. Fat obese parents often beget fat obese children. Society says that’s untrue because the parents have eating disorders but the reality is some don’t won’t the beauty genetic lottery of beauty. The same applies to skin disorders or endocrine nervous system disorders other internal disorders or biological abnormalities.
"It may be worth you getting your hormones checked! Sometimes it is genetics, sometimes its hormones, but you won't know until you ask your GP or something :)"
"From the outside, I would just like to point out that I think disfigurement that is caused by medical reasons differ from obesity in that it is not a result of behaviour or life choices.

So judgement against obese people can be against their decisions, rather than their body.

For scarring etc. Anyone putting you down is the one with a problem, although it is mental and not physical. (not saying fatshaming is OK) 

What I mean is that maybe fat girls continue to get criticised, so they keep fighting against it, while people with scarring was always accepted for how they are. It's just a matter of them becoming comfortable with themselves. For them the body positive movement is part of a transition phase, not a perpetual fight."
Yes that’s being the change you wanna see. Great job
"No that's not okay. Commenting on anyone's body is not okay. If people have co-opt this movement to skinny Shame you then I'm sorry, the body+ community is about loving and accepting yourself regardless of things like physical appearance."
"That's rude. But part of that is also because people see women as community property and they feel too comfortable making unsolicited comments to us about our bodies. 

I'm sick, so I'm losing weight scary fast. I would kill to eat a cheeseburger right now, but I can't. I can only eat a few things. Fresh soup,Greek yogurt, apple sauce, hummus and pickles.i try to find something to add incrementally. My next goals are a salad without any meat and a fresh mild light fish."
"I was just thinking something along this lines. 

My mind was running along a thought such as this; as someone who was overweight until 18 yrs, resorted to a mixture of anorexia/bulimia, and still struggle with. One of the biggest hurdles was self love. It wasn’t until
I grasped that, that I was able to learn to take care of my health (mentally and physically) first then worry about weight. And ya know what, I’m not thin but sure as hell not fat. Butt, hips and thighs all curvy and I love it. 

Self love is the first step to recovery. At least that’s were my weird thought process took me.

Edit: though to thought. Damn auto correct"
"Funny, when I was fat, I was called a whale by my friends, and I am and have always been in possession of a penis between my legs.   It stopped when I worked on my health and got down to under half my previous body weight (~430lbs, down to 210). 

Find something else to outrage signal on."
"""I disagree"" seems like it would do better from someone named u/writenicely"
And the guy is calling it an epidemic lmao Being obese is literally just eating bad for almost all people.
"This is true, generally speaking. Being rude is unacceptable.

However, for me, I never got my act together until my buddy told me I was a flabby tub of grease and shamed me until I went to the gym with him. It was misery for months but I got my shit together.

It is bad to insult someone, but equally we all sometimes need a kick in the ass to get us to change. My friend actually helped me, not just insulted me, and that made all the difference."
It’s really damaging for people going through puberty and young people in general too. It can cause eating disorders and it worries me
Yes. Fat acceptance has become HAES (healthy at every size) where they glorify obesity and claim that it's healthy. And that isn't good at all.
I think we're in agreement. There needs to be education and people need to be encouraged and helped to live healthy lifestyles... But everyone has their vices and everyone has their own preference for what is an acceptable level of health.
">People can do what they want, it is a free country, but we need to focus on healthier eating, education of nutrition, etc.

Agree with this 100% in terms of taxes though, you could say that about any unhealthy behaviour. All you can do is what you said, educate and encourage. You can't force people to live a certain way."
"> But just because self-improvement is what you want to do for yourself

No, that's simply not true. There are addicts out there who think they're doing just fine, but do you honestly expect me to believe that if they kicked their addictions that wouldn't be self-improvement? Some things are objectively good, and things like mental and physical health are completely indifferent to personal feelings. 

>but what impact would it have on my stress levels or everyday happiness to have to restrict my diet?

I don't know, and it sounds like you don't either. But you might be surprised. I can only speak for myself, but I've been at unhealthy weights before, and when I drop a  good chunk of weight I always have more energy, feel more confident, and generally feel happier. This is anecdotal, but I don't think I've ever known, or even heard, someone say that they lost a bunch of weight and felt it just wasn't worth it because the same as they did before at their heaviest. 

From my perspective, it sounds like you're trying to rationalize things. Why not try to improve your physical health for 6 months, and then reevaluate? If you don't feel any better, then you can confidently say that weight doesn't matter for your personal happiness."
And there is type 2 in your blood
Yes! Body confidence and loving your body are two different things

The more popular accounts are skinny white girls but it's a good place to start, just go through the follow recommendations and find people/pages that resonate with you. You can pretty much find every walk of life within the community. Black, white, Goth, hairy,  gay, disabled, fat, skinny, fit. It's just a big melting pot of love and acceptance.  Honestly I can't tell you how much filling my feed with positivity has drastically effected my own body image and mental health. 
 [effyourbeautystandards](https://instagram.com/effyourbeautystandards?igshid=zgm7v82xd4ib) and other pages that aggregate creators content is also a great place to start!"
I don't think this is true. Would it take some getting used to? Yeah. Would it take someone who could see past something like that? Yeah. But unloveable? absolutely not.
Welcome to the club! There's probably more of us. You're welcome to talk about it if you ever want to
"Good point. I watched the Amy Winehouse documentary recently, and while people focus on her addictions, bullimea was a big cause of her death. Yes, being overweight is unhealthy, but there are things which are a lot less healthy."
"Definitely. Self loathing isn't positive. Education, support and respect are positive."
Don't tell the Scots!
Oh no
It's so different coming from a trusted friend Vs a stranger.
"Yeah the pragmatic solution is changing behavior through social support. Incentivizing people to eat healthier, incentivizing businesses to make healthier options, educating citizens in health and what it means in regards to what we eat, etc. 

We already know that insulting people does not change their behaviors and can actually make the opinions more solidified. It's a terrible way to try and solve this issue as the reality is it only makes it worse."
"Because I don't want to. I'm sure it is an addiction, but I understand the risks I'm taking. It's not as severe as most drugs, including cigarettes. I'm only hurting myself, and I have made adjustments to my excercise so that I am at a level of health I am personally comfortable with. I don't think I should have to justify that choice to anyone but myself. But I resent the idea that I only deserve respect if I am actively trying to make changes to my weight."
"That's the entire point of the movement. People who only see it as ""fat people promoting unhealthy lifestyles"" are literally the problem."
"Yep. Not trying to negate the problem of promoting an obese life style in the name of self love.

But if I was educated and supported in how to self love, there is a chance I could of chosen not to go down another unhealthy path. 

I also feel the more important point is there may be a lot more at play then just their weight and if you don’t address those problems as well then a healthy lifestyle may always be out of reach."
"It is as sever as most drugs though.

https://www.thegabrielmethod.com/obesity-vs-smoking-which-is-more-dangerous/"
"Fair enough, thanks for correcting me. I still stand by the fact that people should be educated and encouraged, but not forced to maintain a healthy weight. And that feeling good about yourself regardless of your weight is better than being mocked and bullied. I am not saying people should be encouraged to be overweight. Just that you don't have a right to tell people how to live."
"Ofc man, just be aware that it may be affecting you in ways you dont think of and mental health changes over long periods of time are hard to notice. But i totaly agree, encouragement and education should be the first respons. Its often just frustrating when people become overly defensive or claim ""its not that bad""."

"""Alexa, add salty crunchies to the shopping list"""
Also consider how much you'd actually use.  What's the point in buying 36 ounces if you'll only use 10 and throw the rest out in two weeks?

So, in one supermarket here in Belgium it costs €12.99 for six 1.5l bottles of coca cola, and €4.25 for a six pack of cans

That works out at

€2.165 per 1.5l = €0.014 per 10cl

€0.708 per 330cl = €0.021 per 10cl

So it actually works out better value for money if I get the bottle 

At can price, it would cost me €3.21 to get the same amount of liquid as in a bottle. If I got six bottles for the same price per cl as the cans would be around €18.90! Grrr why do they make it so difficult! 

Don't even get me started on Lipton, they're worse offenders"
These game loading tips aren't supposed to give actual advice (thanks)
"I always do this (in England), and supermarkets make it so hard with inconsistent labelling. A shelf with 3 similar products will have 3 different measurements, so one will say ‘£1 per 100g’, the second will say ‘£10 per 1kg’ and the third will say ‘£2 per unit’ or whatever.

I’m convinced they do it on purpose so it’s harder for shoppers to compare and know what is best value."
"Same for peaches.  I used to work in the produce section.  Any prepackaged produce, such as fruit bowl, came from damaged fruit that we couldn't sell.

A pack of strawberries has a few fuzzies? Cut up the rest and sell them in a bowl.

Somebody dropped and cracked a papaya? Cut it up and sell it.

I couldn’t believe how much more efficient my food shopping trips for once I started ordering my list by the shop layout. Only takes a couple of mins but saves so much time!
My grocery store's app has a list-making feature that will automatically sort all of your items by which aisle they're in. It will also recommend items you often purchase and let you know if they're on sale or if there's a coupon available.
But I want to wander aimlessly around the shop.
"My parents always did this. I’d go with them and thought grocery shopping was fun as a kid. Although the place we always shopped at was this grocery store that was not conveniently located to where we lived — a little father away an with a weird traffic pattern to get there. When I started driving I wouldn’t visit that store because of these reasons. Come to learn that all the other grocery stores in our area had a habit of shifting their layouts every 4-6 months or so. It was so annoying. Mentioned it to my mom one time and she said that’s why they only ever go to the first place, because it’s been the same for 25 years."
My gf was a little weirded out when she found out I do this but after seeing how much quicker our grocery trips are she's very much on board.

Side note: Expiration dates are not always 100% accurate. Your food might go bad well before then."

Rice is in the middle of the store. Canned tomatoes too. Any time I make an Italian sauce or slow-cook chicken for tacos, it’s canned tomatoes. You can do it with fresh, but the fresh tomatoes in the produce section are really there because they look pretty. The canned San Marzano tomatoes have much better flavor. Also, beans are in the middle of the store. And canned soup. Nuts. Almonds are very nutritious. Canned olives. Salsa. Noodles. Olive oil. Vinegar. What about condiments? Mustard. Coffee. Tea. Oatmeal."
I have seen one supermarket where the fresh food was in the middle.

Also our market fresh salads aren’t very fresh your better off to go with our rotisserie chickens!

In Canada the President’s Choice (generic) mac and cheese is the shit. Especially the white cheddar. Most PC brand things are super tasty and usually cheaper than big brands.
Sometimes I actually prefer the generic brands!
"I live on own brand goods. A lot of time they're just as nice, or you're throwing so many ingredients together that it doesn't matter. 

There are some exceptions. Ketchup has to be Heinz for example, for some reason nobody else has managed to capture that flavour."
Also off brand chocolate chips. In my experience at least! But generally ya store brand is just as good and cheaper than name brand!

"The general trend is that people take expiration dates to seriously and throw away food that is perfectly fine. If you want to know if the food is still good just look at it and smell it, if it doesn't look or smell good then it likely isn't.


Your body has a vested interest in keeping you from consuming bad food. So you are quite capable by yourself to determine the food's expiration. Take the expiration date as a nudge to start paying more attention. Not as an absolute law."

"I’m a cashier at Walmart. Can confirm that we don’t give a shit anymore. Once a thief is out of the store, no employees can go after them, not even salaried managers. At that point it’s a police matter (if they get called)."
Yeah it's usually just easier to get the shipment in and stock the fridges from the back.
But I wanted a peanut.

I don’t think that’s true at all. Frozen meals are way more expensive than the ingredients to cook it at home.
I just found this out recently. There was a pound of frozen ground turkey that was half of the regular price. I already had regular ground turkey in my cart so I bought both just to test if they were the same. The frozen was just as good as the other so I'll be saving money in the future.
Bagels are supposed to be toasted.  It does keep them fresh in the meantime
I think it’s just that refrigeration is easiest on the perimeter and most fresh foods need a bit of refrigeration to stay fresh
It's because the core of every walmart contains a portal to the 15th circle of hell where the Walton family count their gold.
"I only do it when I feel like the total sum seems a bit odd. Like I generally have an idea of what the total will be and then sometimes it's a lot higher than that.
One time it was quite a bit too high because the cashier had registered my 10 plums as 10 cauliflowers (the name is slightly similar in my language). 

A similar tip would be to look at the screen that shows what the cashier just beeped. Then you can see if the price is right."
"I used to work customer service in a large supermarket, a lot of people would check their receipt going out the door and come over to dispute prices with me. They were mostly wrong about things but sometimes they were right and would get a refund."
"example: spaghetti squash was 97c a pound so I bought one bc the two of us can make a whole squash stretch w different meals. It rang up like $1.18 a pound at self checkout and I pointed it out and it got sorted before I even swiped my card. You may feel annoying, but when I bought the squash bc of the price, I would rather not buy it at all than pay that amount, so they work with you when the machine price doesn’t match the sign."
"I never did either. But then I started to because I heard it was a good idea. Twice I've found things that don't belong, one was a $50 bouquet of flowers with a unicorn vase, another was a $30 weight watchers something or another. I took it customer service, asked wtf, they said it was a glitch/error, returned my money. I vowed to always keep an eye on receipts from that point on, & have promptly forgotten until this thread:/"
"Yes. If you opted to buy something because it was on sale, sometimes the sale price doesn't ring up. I'm not sure how often, but I notice it maybe 1 in 5 times. This is easily fixed by paying attention to prices as the cashier is ringing everything up. If you notice it, say something and the cashier will fix it on the spot. 

It's better than going home and realizing you actually didn't save a dollar on that box of pasta, because if you would have known you would have just bought the other brand instead."

I got divorced about a year ago. I have my daughter about half the time. I used to do the grocery shopping for the household and it’s been very difficult for me to adjust to buying the correct quantity of things now. Instead of groceries for three every week it’s more like groceries for 1 because when my daughter isn’t here I often just eat whatever or order out so neither one of us eats here every single meal every single day. I’ve transitioned to buying more frozen stuff and storing it to try to combat the waste. But it’s hard to NOT buy the big bag of carrots even though I always end up throwing half of it out.

"When I worked at a subway in a walmart. I served an entire group that was with a thief. They were getting food, and he was in the Walmart grabbing stuff. They had ordered him a sub he was paying for when he got done. I finished his first, and was working on the rest when he walks in with a pie, and a few other things. Grabs the sub, and just walks out. I look at his friends like ""did he really just do that"". None of them seemed shocker, or cared. 

So I called the police then my manager. Note the order. My manager yelled at me for calling them. Saying there was no point in reporting it, and wasting officer time. Like ok, but I just watched a guy just steal from not one, but two stores at the same time. So before the cops got there I had one of the employees get the walmart manager. She basically said the same. But thanks for telling her. 

Cops show up, and I had to tell them everything, and also that no one cared. So the cops left. So yes I most definitely believe you can pretty easily steal from Walmart as long as you're casual, and quick about it."

The biggest thing of potatoes is an absolute unit.  It’s being adopted into SI notation for units
A lot of people don't look a the unit prices closely and assume the bigger one will be cheaper since it usually is. Possible production costs aside it's a way to take advantage of that mindset and goose the margin a bit.
"12 packs are highest volume for manufacturer, so they can make them easier and cheaper than the small batch bulk items. Those savings move through the supply chain to you the customer."
"The idea, I believe, is that people who would go to the store looking for a 12 pack or something would notice that it would be a better/equivalent deal to buy more 12 packs over the 24 packs. Then they buy more than the one 12 pack they intended to get, they feel satisfied with themselves, and the store sells more soda than it would have."

It's the 21st century. Fridges are safe and things stay fresh if you store them right. Plus it has the added benefit of keeping your butter/spread at the same temperature as the bread and doesn't create a warzone when you try to spread cold butter on warm bread.

I read that in a public space.
I had an aunt break a finger trying to 'adjust' the peanut butter on a rat trap (or as even 40 years old me still refers to them today as 'a 2*6 with a spring').
If someone is activly looking for a knife
Would that qualify for r/meatcrayon?
I laughed at this one.
Somewhere around beer 8.
Got the meat instead of the crayon.

"this is a pretty bad mousetrap, to be fair. i bought the exact same ones and theyre hard to set, dont have anywhere to easily place the bait and are twitchy as fuck. footsteps within 20 feet can set them off. there are much much much better designs out there at the same price point. never buy these traps."
It kinda looking tasty doe ngl

"Because he was looking through his phone (to make sure he got it in frame), not directly with his eyes at the trap.

OWWW-oooooOOOoooOOOHooohooohooohooo!
You sir a brave man... A very very brave man.
And this needed to be recorded because?...
It's just the beginning.
"There's a damn good reason the [original](https://i.imgur.com/1JLuDFt.png) is still around.  Because it works.  And they're super cheap.  Just a tiny smear of peanut butter on the little copper bit, and set it somewhere.  Come back the next day to a mouse that was killed instantly.  Seriously they cost like $0.25 each and they **work**.  There's not a lot of room for improvement on that.

The yellow ""cheese"" shaped pads like the one in the OP video are meant to go up against the wall.  They just don't work, mice don't step on them.  These are also less sensitive than the original, so I've found that mice will steal any bait you put on them without setting off the trap.

The various plastic traps work to various degrees, but as others have said, they are weaker and sometimes don't kill the mouse which is troubling.

Glue traps are horrific.  Sooner or later you're definitely going to check one to find little bits of flesh that a mouse left behind.  Even in the best case you're going to find a living mouse that is permanently adhered to a piece of paper.  I don't know why these exist at all."
"they are very similar to the ones i bought after. except the ones i got had spikes instead of the killbar. they had the little bit for the bait and the same loading mechanism, which is an absolute game changer. far superior.       
     
edit: it was these ones https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs9Kr8SLZwE"
Love Mousetrap Monday.
...perhaps
On my balls
"I have no idea, perhaps he wanted to try dropping the crayon again? That's what it looked like to me, he was gonna pick it up."
Had a friend who is very “humane” who used the glue trap to catch a mouse that was stuck in a little crawl space. Once they caught it on the adhesive they were able to release it. I think those only work if you are constantly monitoring it and are using it for the purpose of catch and release. To put adhesive out with the purpose to catching and killing is inhumane and is frankly kind of a mess to clean up.
Its like the yellow traps are designed to feed mice and make you buy more yellow traps.
"I use the Victors at work, 100% agree they are the only mousetrap worth buying. All those plastic monstrosities sacrifice sensitivity for easy setting. If you really dont want to get your hands dirty Victors are cheap enough to use just once and throw away with the dead mouse, but if you want to reset it they are good for many, many uses"
"When I was a kid my sister convinced our mom to buy glue traps. I thought that was stupid so I put a real trap along the same wall. Later in the evening we heard this sound of foam scooching across the carpet. My sister looked at me all wide-eyed, and the THWACK! The mouse got his rear legs stuck in the glue trap and dragged it along the wall only to get nailed by the Victor. Poor thing never stood a chance."
The mice in the video looked dead to me
"You need to use the original victor with the small metal trigger, like [this](https://imgur.com/1JLuDFt) and not that big cheese platform. I use them at work and with some peanut butter smeared on the trigger they are very effective."
do us a favour and record it
"I'm gonna need the vid, for research purposes. I'm sure you understand :)"
"To be honest. I really dont give a fuck if it was staged, those things fucking hurt, especially when it snaps on your nail. Gonna have a purple nail soon ouchies"
Are you suggesting... a mouse conspiracy?
paid actors
"that looks better than the ones i had. but im happy enough with the ones i replaced them with - i caught about 25ish mice with it, its easier to set, easier to remove the dead mouse and its got a nice little bit to put the bait in. its a good trap."
Time to stand up to big mouse lmao. This is how dumbass conspiracy theories start.
Clearly the work of big cat

Comment
"To adopt a disabled baby you are literally committing every day to them for the rest of your life. 

This is one of the most selfless things I could even imagine."
"**Background:**

**08 November 2018 -** Single Dad adopts girl with Down Syndrome rejected by 20 families:

>Alba was just a few days old when she was put up for adoption by her parents because she has Down syndrome. Sadly, 20 other families passed on adopting her by the time she was only 13 days old. But her story got a happy ending when a single dad stepped in to adopt the adorable weeks-old infant.  
>  
>Luca Trapanese’s story went viral with the release of a book he wrote about his life with Alba, a story he says “destroys many stereotypes about fatherhood, religion and family.” Adoption laws in Italy are fairly strict, and rarely are single parents approved, but Alba’s condition warranted an amendment to the normal regulations. And Luca said he experienced no trepidation about the decision, driving to the hospital to fill out the paperwork the moment he was approved.  
>  
>Luca had a history of volunteering and working with children with disabilities, so he felt prepared to raise a child with Down syndrome. And he couldn’t wait to become a dad.“When I held her in my arms, I was filled with joy,” he told the [BBC](https://en.newsner.com/family/single-dad-adopts-girl-with-down-syndrome-rejected-by-20-families/). “I felt she was my daughter immediately. I knew I was ready to be her father.”  
>  
>Luca said Alba, now 1.5 years old, loves to play and meet new people. “I will spend the rest of my life with a girl I love,” Luca says, “and we will do many wonderful things together.”

**Edited** to add additional [**link**](https://mymodernmet.com/luca-trapanese-adoption-story/) with more photos of them"
"So heartwarming. Reminds me of this guy, adopst terminally ill children and spend their last days taking care of them and giving them the love they deserve.       https://youtu.be/fqnoGDQ2i2k"
"I once watched a documentary type program about adopting disabled children. There is a family who had a few kids of their own , when their kids grew up to teens , the parents decided to adopt . These people have hearts of gold . They adopt the kids other people refuse . Now , okay - the people are wealthy so are able to hire help and are able to give the children the medical care they need . 
Amazing people"
"Yeah, she was rejected by 20 families because that's a colossal burden on a family let alone one person. I commend him for his commitment but I don't shame the 20 families either, having a child is a burden let alone one with a disability that needs special attention and care."
"If we're going to immortalize ANYONE with statues, I nominate this guy and his beautiful daughter."
"Fair play to him, I couldn't do it"
"I’m here to ask the real question, how is this dude single tho?

He’s good looking, obviously a caring person, in what appears to be great shape, *and* he’s Italian.  He’s literally the character I create in every video game."
this brought the biggest smile to my face. we need some things like this during these rough times
"Wish him good luck, for a single parent that's gonna really hard."
"This is immensely commendable don't get me wrong, but as someone with a twin brother with downsyndrome, it isn't the rarest of disabilities and there's hundreds of families with incredible fortitude and love who will never receive recognition

Plus they are the most caring, cute and incredible people on this fucking planet, prove me wrong."
"As someone who adopted a child with Down Syndrome; I cannot imagine doing it by myself. My wife is a champ and makes sure he, and my other children, are well taken care of. Props to this guy and I wish them both happiness"
Isn't this some old news? I've heard of this some time ago
"He's a better man than I am, I would never ever do that, it's a life long commitment."
"I doubt she was ""rejected"" by twenty families. When you're in the process of adoption, you absolutely state right away whether or not you're willing to adopt a disabled child. She wouldn't have even been offered to potential parents who hadn't agreed to adopt a disabled child ahead of time.

That being said, it is amazing and incredibly selfless of her father to have adopted her."
Have a nice life sir
"He is a great man with a giant heart! All love and strength for both of them. Now i need a kleenex to get my eyes dry!

Edit: Kleenex"
"I’ll be honest, I’d probably be among those 20, I do not have the mental fortitude to take care of a child with a disability. Props to this guy, the world needs more ppl like him."
To pose with her on Instagram posts and YT vids for sponsorship *
"Dude won't be single long with that story, lol"
he doesn't want down syndrome to define his daughter but you wouldn't know that from his instagram because every post has the hashtag #downsyndrome
/r/humansbeingbros
"Welp, if there is heaven or whatever this man just got bumped into front of the line."
"this isn't /r/tearjerkers gosh darn it 

my heart swells"
What does rejected mean in this sense? The girl was with the families and they gave her back? She was seen and rejected?
"I totally understand those 20 families. They probably see happy families all around them and just want the same. A care free happy family.

Knowing several families with kits in more difficult conditions, it's not hard to imagine what that means. For the individuals, for the marriage, for possible siblings.

Choosing that voluntarily means choosing to dedicate yourself and your family to this kid. If that's just not what those families want, all the better that they pass.

Which makes it even more impressive to see this guy do it. Alone! I bow my head because I most likely couldn't do it."
Her smile just melts you <3
"The dad is certainly a hero, but it does help that she’s the cutest kid ever too"
"Seems like a nice guy, it’s a shame he keeps getting rejected by families."
"This made me cry, such a good story."
I hope that he adopted her out of kindness and not to become internet famous like those others assholes.
Movie plot:  Man adopts Downs syndrome kid to use it to get sympathy laid but by the end he falls in love with the kid.  Starring Adam Sandler.
"I really hope that this whole situation has been properly assessed and the father and daughter have practical and emotional support, because honestly leaving a vulnerable child, the extent of whose disabilities are unknown, with a single man with no experience of parenthood sounds like a recipe for absolute disaster."
*And then uploads it on the internet so everyone knows what a good person is he
And his tinder just broke the internet.
A beautiful story - this made my Sunday.
Lucky number 21.
"Downs syndrome isn't as bad as I feel people think no it is. 

I work with a chap called alex who has a part time job, a girl friend (who also has downs) , a car (he can drive but not on the road) a pet and a flat attached to his parents place.  Nice funny guy who loves to dance.  That's a good example of a person with downs fully supported and enabled but aren't we all just looking for that.  With love patience and care the majority of people with hereditary disability are as ability abled as the rest of us."
"All I’m reading is “Dude cheats system, finds out you can find a best friend anywhere and we have awesome systems for the world to meet awesome people if they really want to”"
"He's also adopted every woman who is single in Italy, and many attached women to boot."
Yea now she's still behaving like any other baby but he will regret that decision in 10-20 years at most just like most parents of disabled children do.
“Yeah it’ll get charged 20 bucks!
That’s a special person
 It needs courage. You'll be a good father.
And everybody liked this story. And if you don't I'll kick your ass.
Girl. Wtf. I don’ mind
"This is awesome but wouldn't it just be ""Guy adopts (...)"", because he became the single dad upon adoption, ""Single Dad adopts (...)"" implies he adopted her and already has a child at home, doesn't it? Maybe he does though, I don't know. 

also single dad"
Legend.
Have you waited 20 years yet?
As someone with a sibling who has downs this made me tear up a bit. What a wonderful human being.
What a man
Wish him all the luck an money he need (he seems to have all the love already)
"Congratulations, you have DiGeorge Syndrome, I am Dutch"

Excellent. :-).
Dad and NOT daughter means different things on different websites
I love how this article fails to mention his own struggles of becoming a parent as a single GAY man who was also not being allowed a child of his own for so long.
"My mans too pure for this world, ‘spect"
"This is the most heartwarming post I've seen in months, thank you for sharing this"
"I was commenting to my wife a while ago, you don't see too many people with Downs anymore. She stared at me and then I remembered the prenatal test. Dark."
"Reading this article made me ugly cry like a motherfu\*\*\*\*. Bless this father. I raised a child with a very rare disease called AHC. He had seizures and his body would go into dystonia on one side of his body. The child was non-verbal and couldn't walk but was ALWAYS happy and in a good mood unless he was having an attack. We really take things for granted in this life, but raising a child like this really put's life into perspective."

Shel is that you?!
Man this brought tears to my eyes. We should start a go fund me to help them go on any and every adventure they want together. What a guy.
I imagine you need to have a well paying job or cheap/free daycare when you work.
"Okay, I'll say it.

This guy is handsome as fuck"
That site is cancer
It takes years for a black kid to be adopted in a lot of cases and we are up in arms that it took a couple week a for a kid with Down syndrome lol
...
"Okay, but asking the real questions here: how come seemingly every man from Italy is like supermodel levels of hot?"
"Thank you for this, made my day."
"Bruh, have you?

Girl: Yeah"
Someone marry that man!!!
"I love you bro. 
Nuff said."

This Guy is the man I hope one day to be
"Litterly makes me smile and weep at the same time. To commit to a child who is not biologically yours and a disabled one takes great people. While I am just 27, no kids and my wife wants to adopt i don't know if i can commit and give love to a child who is not mine. Worse, my own brother is disabled and I have seen what it takes to take care of him. I do not know I have what it takes but whoever does, you are my heroes."
Dad? Is that a thing
"With so much negative shit being posted, it is heartening to see this, maybe there is hope for the human race after all"
They are the cutest!
"God damnit, can't stop the fucking tears. I would wish the guy a great life, but he's already living his best one."
I shudder to imagine one of those families adopting a healthy child who develops special needs later on.
My Dad just said that.

"Roy’s sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.

*Um… find out if there’s a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?*

She also said the waiting list is like eight months.

*Eight months? I don’t even know if I’ll want a baby in eight months.*"
"I’m surprised there were so many families, including the bio family, that rejected this sweetie. Before we adopted our kids we talked with the social worker about adopting kids with disabilities and were told that there was a waiting list with parents that wanted a child with Down syndrome. She told us that these kids tend to be very loving and sweet, and they were always wanted. I guess it’s different today."

Nice! But 2 Years old."
"This is fake news, you’re actually not allowed to adopt if your single men. But women can."
She is such a doll!!
"Damn that's harsh for the child to be rejected so much, all it wants is to learn about life in an enjoyable way."
What an absolute waste of human resources.
"Well, he certainly got the attention he wanted. I think this is akin to people doing random acts of kindness, but filming it for social media networks. 

In his case he is firing it out all over social media networks and using it to advertise his book."

"Am I the only person who gets really upset by ‘uplifting news’? I’m really glad for him and her, but there are 20 other people who really suck, and that’s a bummer."
And taking it on as a single parent makes it even more challenging. They're both very fortunate to now have each other.
"This just reminds me of that YouTuber mom who only adopted that autistic boy for the clicks, then ""rehomed"" him (her words) when she got tired of taking care of him. I feel so sad for the poor little boy..."
It’s also not a bad thing that people realised/admitted they couldn’t make that commitment

This is the purest act of love and devotion I can imagine.
"I’m not trying to takeaway from the act because I agree it’s a great thing. I’d like to see how they’re doing in a couple years. I don’t even think there will be anything bad but it’s a more hopeful and inspiring scenario if it is successful. Also if he’s having a hard time, we could work together to help both. I just know in the wider scheme of adoptions I always wonder what happened and what those people grew to be,"
"Like literally impossible:  

-	Is he going to quit his job
-	get a 24/7 live in nanny 
-	drop her off at a care Center and pick her up after he’s done working?  


Emphasis on single dad. It’s hard enough to take proper care of kids that don’t need extra care."
Before you make a baby you need to consider if you’re ready to commit that much time since you can’t know how they’ll turn out.
"There are people who adopt to fill their Instagram account with pretty pictures and adopt a new one when the novelty factor is gone.

I think everyone who puts their children on social media is an attention whore."
I really hope this ain't a Myka Stauffer 2.0
"This isn't actually true.

Any parent is doing the same for any child rhey love and though with a differently abled child you will often spend considerably more time in later life (though not necessarily). It can quickly become a new normal and a way of life which is in no way worse or better (or harder) than any other more traditional arrangement.  Yes money and stability can make everything easier but this is true of everything.

And I say this as someone who has lived with a disabled baby...who became a disabled adult over the last 30 years and the majority of that time was a joy. 

 The hardest part is often wishing more for rhem than they can have because of the limitations and ignorance in our society.  
Also fighting the stigma that being with a disabled baby... teen ...adult ...elderly is something to be feared because it is overwhelmingly difficult. When it is not.

Life is difficult. Love and acceptance is hard to find but the disabled people I've lived with and loved and worked with and cared for are some of the kindest , funniest, most lovely , unjudgemental, easy going people I've ever met.  

I did not choose this path in life but I wouldn't hesitate in choosing if I had choice.  Only as selfless as choosing or accepting to be a parent of any quality."
"Following this train of thought, I’m glad those families rejected her. Not because I don’t want her to have a home/family, but because they recognized that they weren’t willing to put in the work."
"Single dad here, it’s hard enough raising a daughter *without* a disability. Seems like a genuine dude, my gut tells me he won’t be single for long lol"
They don't generally live long.
Yea. This is some true hero shit. I’ve seen some people bashing others for not adopting but it is a time commitment as well as a pretty hefty financial commitment that is impossible for some. Glad this kid found a home with someone who has the capacity to help them and love them.
"I feel bad about it, but I know I just couldn't do that. I don't have it in me to be happy in that situation.

I imagine I'd be a good fit for somewhat older kids with moderate behavior problems, at least. As a gay man who might want kids but isn't sold on babies, I've thought about it a little."
"sadlly its for the rest of her life, children with Down typically dont survive to be very old but they are very happy. 

and to give a disabled child the chance to have a real family is truly sign of a big heart"
"He sounds like he was an amazing person prior to the adoption, having worked with lots of disabled adults and children. So its perfect and im glad that child gets to feel love.

I cant imagine a parent giving away a child because they have any disability, but i guess she is better off in the end"
Myka Stauffer disagrees.
"For the duration of the child’s life*

Let’s be real"
But he gets to take pictures and have endless internet attention.
"There is no such thing as selflessness. He's already received an incredible amount of attention and monetary support. I don't know what's in his heart, but if this was truly selfless we wouldn't have heard about it at all."
I am happy to see her have a father now. People rarely adopt special needs kids because they are difficult to care for. Especially ones who are intellectually disabled.
"wow I cant imagine a better, more suitable father.

she looks so happy"
oh my goodness.  the link with additional pics is worth clicking.
Great dude right there.

"I saw that clip before and also learned that he himself is now also terminally sick :(.

He is a literal saint, they always get the good guys."
Reminded me of that too.  Watched that clip and came back here.  I'm not someone that cries easy but tears were seeping out.  Just want to give that guy a hug.  He's a hero.  That much sacrifice is humbling.

I am not a religious man, but Mohamed an angel of mercy."
I've always wanted to do that with elderly animals... Adopt them from the shelter and let them live the rest of their lives in peace
"I have a 7 year old daughter EXACTLY like the little girl in that video. If and when the day comes where we lose her, I may do something similar. He’s not exaggerating the amount of work it is either, this video doesn’t even properly capture it. But it’s so so worth it. People often ask me “Ow do you do it?” and I always reply “How could I not?”"
Yeah. I don't blame the family for putting the child up for adoption either. Those with downs and other extreme cognitive disabilities can never care for themselves and can if not do require extensive and expensive therapy not everyone can afford. Not to mention the emotional burdens on the family. You pretty much have to be wealthy to afford to adopt a disabled child.
"Toughest experience of my life was when my daughter was born with a cleft palate. Having to learn how to take care of a special needs baby is a struggle, and the surgery had me so stressed I passed out in the hospital cafeteria.

I can't imagine how strong these parents are who take on more serious conditions even if they are wealthy. It takes a huge emotional toll."
"I was a social worker years ago and there was a poor family who would not only foster, but adopt, kids with disabilities. They were so amazing. Sometime it would be the middle of the night and you would be driving your state car back to the office with abandoned 3 kids and no easy placement. You aren't allowed to take them home. Everything is full, then there is this family you know will help. They had 13 children. They were so poor they couldn't fit the kids in the house. Long story short, Oprah came.in and bought them a house. So cool."
"Exactly this. This dude is legit a truly amazing guy. But those families that were able to look at the situation and recognize that they could not properly care for her did they best they could for her. Besides, since they knew they couldn't handle it, it led to this guy getting her. It all worked out for the best in her case."
"I don't even blame her birth parents. For whatever reason they didn't think they could handle it so they did the right thing.


Not everyone is meant to be a parent. Let alone one with special needs."
I don’t see where anyone tried to shame 20 families. I only see where they’re celebrating one new family created by these two great people.
"I'm actually glad they gave her up, because they avoided the heartbreak of trying to raise her then having to give her up after years of frustration (or worse). That can have a huge impact on a disabled kid and instill fears or harmful habits that could affect them for a long time."
"Yep, you should have messaged Myka Stauffer before she rehomed her adopted son!"
It's better for everyone involved if a family that is not prepared for that responsibility passes on it.
I wonder if he truly knows what he’s up for.
"And that other dad who took his disabled son on all those triathlon things... We really build monuments for the dumbest people.

*Rick Hoyt is his name and also they do have a statue in Boston haha, so we got one right."
"Absolutely! In a town I lived in (Louisville, CO) they had a statue for a guy that was really nice to everyone."
Yup.Legends the both of them.
Same
"Yes! I was horrified to read this part:

""Even single parents are considered for adoption on a case-by-case basis. “I was told that I’d only be given a child with an illness, a severe disability, or with behavioral problems,” he explained.""

They give the kids who need the most care to the (potentially) least stable homes??? That is messed up!"
Yeah it's just like an update
"The article says shes 1.5 years old, but some of the tags on pictures say two years ago."
Kleenex
Probably not. Adopting a child is super hard for a single guy or a gay couple because of this.
"No, its irregular behavior for a single man and should draw some skepticism.  We can revisit this story in a couple years, it has my alarm bells ringing.  Not necessarily a child molester, but other motivations than the unconditional love for someone elses offspring."
"Pedophiles often put themselves in positions where they have access to vulnerable children: sports groups, youth clubs, daycare, schools, churches, etc....

So does this situation ring alarm bells?

Yes!

He has adopted a special needs child after years of working with special needs children.

There have been so many fostered and adopted children who come forward with sexual abuse histories and most of those were within a couples dynamic, but there have also been children adopted by single men who have reported the same (grooming followed by abuse).

This situation is particularly alarming because she IS special needs. It is more difficult to identify abuse when the victim may not understand or be able to communicate effectively.

It's a weird situation and should be followed closely by social services."
I don’t know if having a disabled child is high on the dating profile checklist
Username checks out
"Surely, he's just in it for the Karma. What a selfish POS! ^^^^^^/s"
"OK here's a hot take : it's the deed that matters, not the intention behind it"
"Sounds more like they had a list of people willing to adopt and asked them if they would be interested. Rejection is a bit of a harsh word here. A lot of people do not have the time, money or capacity to adopt and look after a disabled child. They may not have felt prepared or able to take care of her and that's for the best. She should go where she can be best cared for and it's the responsible thing to do to say no if you don't believe you are the best carer for her."
Article said he has lots of volunteer experience working with disabled kids.
"If you had read, you would understand that he's way more qualified than the countless young people out there having accidental pregnancies and contributing to the problem."
Would you say the same if it was a single woman
"Article literally says he has a history of volunteering and working with children with disabilities and feels prepared to raise a child with special needs. Also, adoption agencies don't just drop kids off and go after meet someone one time."
"What about single moms who raise their biological children with disabilities while having no “experience of parenthood”? How is this any different? 

It’s not, and you’re dumb"
"I heard a lot of disabled kids end up getting abused :(


#ProChoice :)"
Also he wrote a book about it all lol
"Yes if you do this kind of good deeds, you have the right to be proud and share it on the internet."
"He is also spreading awareness about Down syndrome, which could encourage other people to give children with this genetic disorder a chance."
"He was down to adopt her, hopefully he isn't let down by the experience"
"Downs syndrome is basically a coin flip when you're born.  You can grow up to have some independence and have a lot of agency, or you can be stuck as essentially an infant for your entire life having to have every single thing done for you.  Downs syndrome IS pretty fuckin bad."
The state of Reddit where people are sceptical about someone doing a nice thing. Maybe because he's a nice and caring guy?
"I know, right? These people with a heart make me sick. /s"
"See, I’m on the opposite end. I dont get all the extreme praise. I’ve worked with people with intellectual disabilities for over 20 years, people of all ages and all disabilities. I would do this in a heartbeat, if I had the opportunity. All kids have their own challenges and in this case the health and behavioral concerns are already established. Not a lot of guesswork, other than waiting to see how severely she has been impacted. 

I know people with DS who have their apartments, their jobs and tons of hobbies. I know other people that have lots of heath concerns or a higher cognitive impact that require assistance with daily living skills, managing MH conditions, or severe rigidity and low frustration tolerance, while navigating situations to ensure they are not at risk for abuse. 


The hardest part, to me, would be fearing my own death and knowing I couldn’t be there to ensure safe and appropriate support into her old age. While I’m here? We got this, no problem."
"Yep, suspicious"
"Maybe he wants a kid, maybe he doesnt want to have to deal with a crazy girlfriend or wife to do so, maybe the state only allowed him to adopte this down syndrome child because nobody else wanted to adopt her and because I imagine non-down children can only be adopted by couple or something. Just taking a guess"
"Oh yes I know right, how dare someone love a child because it has a disability, nah while we are at it we should send them all back to the circus because surely no-one would want a disabled child to care for because they are sooo much worse"
"Ok same, I’m super selfish and cannot even imagine doing this? Liiiike?"
The why might be uploading lots of cute selfie videos of the kids with his cute face in them for this 250k subscribesml.
Mentally disabled young girl with single arabic man unsupervised.... what could go wtong?   Reminds me of that article  celebrating the gay male couple adipting a little boy and sure enough three years later they were busted being in a gay child sex ring with gay men adopting little boys.
He's gay.
"On god

#ProchoiceOrDie"
"She was, that's why she is in a foster in the first place."
"Yeah, I noticed that too. Seems to conspicuously leave out something that's pretty central to the story."
I love you both
"Being honest about that doesn't make you a bad person. Most people are thinking the same, but won't admit it out loud."
It would be more harsh for a family to take her on that knew they weren't up for the task. That's how kids wind up in extremely neglectful situations. They best thing they could have done for this kid was realize that they could not give her what she deserved and allow her to find a family that could.
It's understandable though
"Rejection is a strong word in the article.... should have used something else. Committing to raise a disabled child, especially one with Downs, can be the better part of your lifetime. Some kids grow up and can live in group homes, but some are always mentally incapable of being left with anyone that's not 100% trustworthy of keeping them safe."
Why so?
Don't be so hard on yourself
"Don't look at it like it's a competition. Share some kindness around you, no matter how big or small it seems. Even lifting someone's mood when he/she is having a bad day would be a big deal to the person."
"Don't make it about yourself. I only say this because i'm lowkey insecure and sometimes i catch myself being a bit self-obsessed, making everything about myself and that great thing someone/i did and how i feel about it and how i'm so great for doing it. Sometimes it's just about other people, especially when it comes to helping others"
"Do something yourself. It doesn't need to be as grandiose but get yourself out of your comfort zone and do all the good you can, wherever you can, whenever you can, anything you can."
"No selfless action, that helps your community, is too small.

It could be as small as picking up a piece of litter you found and making sure it goes in a trashcan.  
It could be a smile and a ""hi"", to a stranger as you walk past them, even if your not feeling happy yourself.  That small interaction, to the stranger, could make their day, because you were pleasant to them and noticed them.

Just because our small acts of kindness don't make headlines, doesn't mean they are not just as valuable as the ones that do.

*Hugs*"
"You can look for your local [Special Olympics](https://www.specialolympics.org/get-involved/volunteer)

Probably because you have a sexist biased on men raising kids
Because you're projecting your own pedophilic attractions onto others. You know how all those homophobic priests and politicians who were caught molesting boys and visiting gay brothels? Yeah like that
"You're a right wing piece of human garbage, that's why you get downvotes."
Have you tried coming up with original ideas?
How do they suck? Doing this is essentially ruining your life and any hopes and ambitions you may have.
"The Stauffer family. They adopted a child from China, they had doctors warning them that his problems were likely severe and that he would have a lot of challenges. The ""parents"" decided that they weren't going to listen. They crowdfunded the adoption, monetized every part of the child's life. The mom made vlogs bitching about him, she treated her bio children differently, she duct taped his thumb, was annoyed by his food insecurity. They then decided that they didn't want him anymore and abandoned him. They're fucking suck and I really hope little buddy is in a better home."
It's sad that that's something we all know now. However I feel better about this situation since he's got experience working with disabled kids. I don't think he deserves to be associated with that whole situation right now.
The poor guy at the top
Yeah I'm hoping this doesnt happen to this guy. I hope he meets an equally excellent partner to help him.
Such a Karen thing to do
He had RAD and the professionals suggested he find a new home.
Yeh I don't agree with the use of the word rejected in the title.
"Agreed. Unrelated: How do they even count who's passed on this child? I always imagined these kids just had pictures in a book and people picked them out like ""I'll take that one."" So in my mind they were just counting the number of people who flipped over this girl's page in the year book, but I obviously have no clue how it works so that's just my gears turning."
"Children with significant disabilities are eligible for social security. Parents can also be reimbursed for being their carer.

It is absolutely not a lot of money, but allows for food on the table and a roof over their heads. In my state, she would receive 30hrs/week of specialized schooling, as well as related therapies like speech, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. 

Again, these supports allow the family to live at a bare minimum. Special needs parents are incredibly selfless."
"He could work from home, have a strong family support system, or simply make enough he can pay for a daily caregiver while he's at work. Depending on the situation with the school district he lives in preschool starts at age 3 for children who qualify, that helps."
"I have a 19-year old daughter with Down syndrome. She attends school like any teenager (and before school she was obviously at daycare etc.). In the afternoons she quite often goes to youth groups for teens & young adults with special needs.

We have a very ordinary life, my husband and I both work full time and we have two other children. If there aren't any additional problems, raising a child with Down syndrome is not some huge personal sacrifice. She is a normal part of the family, life certainly doesn't revolve around her."
"ok, from a post below by OP the whole thing happened in Italy, not the US. I assume its social systems are similar to those we have here in Germany (which I briefly worked in), it's still a huge commitment, no question, but its no 24/7, and help is not a question of money as it is over there in the land of the free. Italy has special needs kindergartens and schools and caring/working facilities for older ages."
"I have a neighbor who is an older single man who first fostered, then adopted a little girl with severe issues. She was supposed to be adopted by someone else a couple of years ago, but when it fell through he adopted her so she could have a stable home. 

She’s flourished under his care. 

He owns his business, so is able to work around her schedule or bring her with him. With the quarantine, my daughters have been babysitting the few times he needs to go without her. 

There are good stories out there."
"I work with families and young children with significant disabilities. Typically, a child with these needs would be in a school full time with specialized support. No different than other kids at preschool while their parents work, except the kid will have a team of professionals there making sure they are able to get a good education."
They can test for Down syndrome really early in the pregnancy. If my kid is going to have it you can bet the next stop will be an abortion clinic
I agree.
" [https://www.instagram.com/p/B1ZOKJEoqT3/?utm\_source=ig\_embed](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1ZOKJEoqT3/?utm_source=ig_embed)  

LMAO, try to focus on his right arm and her forearm. BTW they are so cute."
"Exactly. Imagine an ill-prepared person raising a child, let alone one with special needs."
The guilt is in you. The story is just describing the situation.
You're not cutting onions. I'm not cutting onions. Please stop whoever it is.
"I'm a social worker for adults with disabilities, and I would like to dispell what you said, because I think it is a common myth.  Just like other developmental disabilities (that term generally means cognitive impairments that occur before the age of 18 and are expected to be lifelong) Down Syndrome exists on a wide spectrum and people can have a whole range of cognitive abilities.  I work with MANY people with Down Syndrome who live on their own, have jobs, get married, sign their own contracts, manage their own money, etc."
"Suppose it is better for those 20 families to say no, to end up with a man adopting her who is more than capable.

Better to have 20 families say no, leading to the right man saying yes, than to say yes and not be able to raise her properly. Definitely much better to wait and receive the proper care she deserves."
It's just too bad this wasn't caught in the womb. In Sweden they test for Down Syndrome and a few other things in the womb and many women have early term abortions after an amniotic fluid test.
Oh but she said he verbally said he was okay with it /sarcasm
I have family in Mexico. It's not helping.

Thank you! We use a total different word in my country.
Kind of like how people call tissues Kleenex)
"My ex works for Child Protective Services and the consensus amongst her and her co-workers was that there was a high suspicion of single guys being pedophiles if they tried to adopt, just because they're guys. I don't know if they would get turned down or not, but it's kind of heart breaking. I'm single and I would love to adopt, but not bad enough to be labeled that for the rest of my life."
"He's gay. He's not going to have biological children of his own. He was denied adoption for a long time since he's gay, but they made an exception for Alba, since she was hard to find a family for, and since he's got experience with disabled kids."
So you're saying a single male parent is incapable of loving and raising a child alone? Sounds like you have some personal issues you're portraying on other people.
"Well he adopted her in 2017, and recently released a book about his life with Alba.
His motivations were pretty clearly stated in the hundreds of articles written about him in the last three years, as well as being able to watch a slice of their lives on Instagram. I don't have to defend him further than that because he has done *nothing wrong.*

You should have your alarm bells checked. His race, sexual identity, gender, and marital status are *not* reasons to pre-judge his character or attack him.

I'm a single father. Your biased thinking is why ""we can't be trusted"" with babies or little girls. Child molesters are sick pieces of shit. There are tons of men that raise, teach, and protect all kinds of children, for no other reason but to be the person that is there when no one else will stand for that child.

Thanks for perpetuating the myth that we are all barely restrained animals that have sex or abuse of power as our only motivation for affection or attention."
"Please no sarcasm here, people on reddit can't take it."
That's not a very good hot take.
"That’s just awful logic. Like, if Im walking the streets looking to murder someone, then bump into a mugger and accidentally stop a robbery, am I a good person? Fuck no."
I would. What he's doing is very brave and amazing but also very hard and stressful to handle so I sincerely hope he has a good support system. The same would be true for a woman.

Apt username you've chosen for yourself.
"Or maybe he has bad intentions and is looking for a young vulnerable girl who won't be able to tell anyone what might goes on. 
There's a lot of fucked up people in this world, so you can never be too cautious."
"Hi! You do have an opportunity to. 

Babies with disabilities are placed for adoption all the time. If you go through the county, an adoption can cost as little as $3,000."
It's definitely a lot of responsibilities.
So you can go public and write a book about it. It's a means to an end. Narcissism is real and goes much deeper than many notice.
"“if” should be “that”, I agree."
Love you back!
It’s a work in progress but I’ll try
"Yeah you’re probably right, I haven’t met many men that have the patience for little kids let alone a disabled one."
Gross. Interesting as I said nothing about that. Who’s projecting now. Weirdo.

"Oh in that case this isn’t uplifting news at all. They all dodged a bullet, and this guy is getting praised for “ruining” his life."
On both of them :-) :-)
"I’m wary of any family that YouTube’s their kids lives. 

My son when he was younger would watch videos of families who had millions of views, hundreds of thousands of followers, one family in particular it was so blatantly sponsored shit they’d been given to film their kids playing with. 

I banned all those videos from my house. It was disgusting, literally parents using their kids as money makers. One kid even has merchandise. Toys at Kmart with this kids face on it so your kids too buy the same toys their kids get for free. 

Fuck any parent who does this. Literally their entire house, the kids bedroom, what they did on the weekend, what they ate, all on YouTube. 

Those kids are going to grow up as broken, awful human beings."
The worst thing is people defending them seem to be completely ignoring the reasons that people are mad. I completely agree with finding a better suited home for him but those parents absolutely used him for profit and honestly it seems like that was always their intent.
"Jesus, this is the worst thing I've read in a while. I hope he's all right.

In general, if a family puts their kids on YouTube for clicks and views, I'm sensing a truly toxic dynamic."
"Can you not give them the attention? That's literally what they want, even if it's negative attention."
"Growing up, I was always glad I wasn’t adopted. I knew that I would’ve been kicked out if I was. I wonder if the kid is capable of feeling the same."
"From the interviews and videos I’ve seen, they never explicitly said it but they gave me the impression that he physically attacked one of their bio children and realized they couldn’t keep up with the autistic child, so had to move him out.

With all the hubbub about autistic kids and antivaxxers, they thought they could handle an autistic child when in reality they were woefully unprepared."
"Ducted taped his thumb?  I'm not in favor of executions, but hang her for this behavior."
That child being re-homed is by far the best part of the story.
"Would the professionals suggest the same if their own biological kids had the same issue? I don't think people understand what an adoption is.

And did you hear those professionals saying so or was it the excuse the parents gave?"
that's such bullshit. how is giving the child away going to help his ATTACHMENT DISORDER. all the ways to help a child through that never once mention to abandon him. he just didn't fit into their youtuber lifestyle
"That word is by all means appropriate. Parents of disabled children don't get that choice. They take care of them wether they think they can or not and make it happen. Those 20 families decided to adopt, oh, but this one is broken, give me another one. We want one that's easy. Nothing wrong with that.  All parents want easy beautiful healthy children, but it's not like those who get them disabled via birth are better predisposed to handling it than those who have that choice going into the adoption process. So yes, that girls was rejected. Godspeed to the new dad."
My best friend adopted last year. They had to wait for a birth mom to choose them. Then they had the option of agreeing to adopt that particular child or not. I'm in the US so this may be different in other countries.
So she’s going to receive proper care and get loved beyond imagination.
"I'm from The Netherlands, in our country the welfare system is for people who struggle with their health, can't keep a job because of it or have disabilities. We have a nice system and people are thankful of it. Nobody has a problem with that.

However it is heavily frowned upon to use the welfare system by your own choice. Quitting your job and receiving welfare so you can have a child is not done. ""Bijstandsmoeders"" (single mothers on welfare) get around €2000 net a month and a lot of people don't like that system. They have the opinion that they should have a partner that works for an income. We recently had a new law pass for subsidising IVF for single women and it had a lot of resistance from the people."
"You mean land of milk and honey and where people vote against universal health care because the ""others"" also get to have it, and vote for tax cuts for the rich because abortions and guns?"
"Unless you pay for an expensive test in the first trimester that's not covered by insurance, most people don't find out the fetus has Down Syndrome until the anatomy scan at 20 weeks, which makes it incredibly hard to get an abortion. Not impossible, but hard. 

And this is something you'll want to discuss with your partner and make sure you're on the same page, because it will ultimately be her choice, not yours."
i saw that.  lol
Yeah it's the same in the UK. The majority (something around 90%) of fetuses with down's syndrome get aborted before they're ever born because they can detect it early on.
I imagine with the country being as religious as it is that they would not have terminated the pregnancy even if they had found out early.
"I never know how to feel about this. I respect a woman's right to choose. I also have a sibling with Down's syndrome, and the fact that the abortion rate is so high makes it feel like people don't think their life is worth living."
"This will go over really well I’m sure, but not everyone uses the test, because it wouldn’t change what happens."
"very cool, thanks for sharing!"
"Single fathers are actually viewed better than single mothers by the general community, so I wouldn't worry too much.  
  
The adoption agency might want to do more background checks etc. before accepting you as a prospective adoptive parent, but by law you are allowed to adopt. There are definitely people and organisations willing to help you become a father!"
"Because over 90% of sex crimes are committed by men, and pedophilia and incest are the most common porn topics, being consumed in massive numbers."
"oh come on, that's an extreme example of what I was trying to say.

I'm thinking more of someone giving money to charity to look good in social media or something lof the sort.

the money still goes to charity, people will still benefit from it."
"I hope this story ends well. But I have my doubts. This will be a daily struggle.  Hell, HOURLY.  People can snap under such extreme, constant pressure."
"""Look how much of a better guy I am for pointing out this guy doing something good and sharing it"" better?"

I love ur username lmao also what did u say ur comment deleted
"Nice, deleting your comment about this hero of a man being a pedophile, /u/bitchfacegrace"
Yeah it really isn't uplifting.
"It's so very bizarre, not to mention inappropriate. Your kids can't consent to every part of their lives being shared, I wonder how it affects their relationships with their parents in the long term."
"Unfortunately, ""Showbiz"" Mom and Dads have always existed, this isn't a new phenomenon brought on by YouTube.

Just remember almost all children actors, especially those in a lot of nostalgic media you yourself enjoyed as a child, have suffered a similar or worse fate to those in the videos you have banned.

This is not a validation of what these parents are doing, I myself find it utterly disgusting, just a reminder that this is a problem bigger and older than YouTube."
"god this reminds me of the parents who used to mentally abuse their kids and lie to them about things and make them cry just for clicks and likes. i think eventually stopped ,bc they got demonized but im not sure"
It's going to be real interesting how the parents will continue to exploit Ryan when he's no longer a cute little kid playing with toys.
I watch a food traveler. Literally seen his kid grow up through out the videos. He's about 4 now. But his videos just focus on the food and the kid makes what I could only describe as cameo appearances because in some videos he's not around completely because he's back at the hotel taking a nap with the mom.
I've had to completely take YouTube off my daughter's devices. It went way better than I thought it would. A for adley was the only one I was okay with but there's nothing for my child to gain from watching those kind of videos.
"Ew. My son's grandmother tried to force me to put him on youtube and put his pictures up so he could make money cause he was 'soooo cute'.

thank god i keep my son as far away from her as possible"
"My four year old got caught up in those videos as well. I don’t want to name names but I think I know exactly who you’re talking about. He has toys at almost every store we have been in, even Walgreens. We put an end to those videos here as well. 

I went looking though and they are not the only family doing it and aren’t the only ones with a toy/merchandise line."
Ryan’s Toy Review... Never let my kids watch that but enough of their friends do that I had to check it out to see what it was.
"My son watched that channel and two others who use their kids - all three with millions of subs.   I’m so glad he’s mostly past that phase.  It’s mostly a Minecraft YouTuber now - while he’s loud and way too excited about finding emerald blocks, he has a kid I’ve never seen and if he has a guest, it’s his wife of sibling."
"Oh, I know That Kid, who also has a shitty video game named after him. At first it seemed innocuous, just parents taking home videos which happened to be a hit, then the sponsored toys started coming and the videos felt...off. I banned my son from watching those. I uninstalled Youtube Kids entirely because the app showed nothing but those videos for the longest time."
Yes but...I’d love for my kid to have a sponsorship deal that brings in 20m a year so she can play w toys on camera. That kid is lucky as fuck and I don’t think he’ll have a broken awful existence.
Then again sometimes its just fun to do a channel with your kids who like pokemon or like zelda or whatever so you make the YouTube channel dedicated to that subject as a bonding experience.
"I mean legally they're doing a private adoption from what I've seen. Morally they're abandoning a child, a child who already has trauma from his life in an orphanage. It's frankly heinous that they're likely not going to see many repercussions for this."
"Once you adopt(or give birth to) a kid, you can sign a few papers and basically give them away like a puppy. It’s called disrupting adoption."
"This is a rabbit hole for sure. They call it rehoming and it’s a whole thing that’s really gross and weird and literally all it takes to do is to sign a piece of paper transferring “ownership” to someone else. It is not sanctioned by any government or private entity.

"Exactly, if they had a shred of decency they would use those millions of dollars they made from exploiting him to at least set him up with a nice comfortable life. But you know they won't because they're selfish trash."
The mom did a lot of pretending that she was a good Christian momma with five kiddos. Which first of all the language these people use makes me want to vomit. Second of all I firmly believe the Jesus stuff was to attract viewers from a different demographic. It's pretty insane and easy to fall down the rabbit hole while researching.
"The sheriff's department in the area investigated and he's not in any danger or with bad people, so that's good. I just hope whoever he ends up with gets him all the therapy he's going to need."
"You can read about it all, I did when it happened. It’s real easy to shit on a person for making a hard decision, it’s a lot hard to show empathy and try to find out the whys of things. Everything I read, yeah maybe they are garbage people for a million other reasons, but RAD is no joke, it’s deadly serious and can endanger other children, so finding him a home he can be safe in and be safe from harming others was an absolute priority."
"Read up on RAD dude. It’s not just an ATTACHMENT DISORDER. There’s no way they could’ve known he had it, despite people telling them he was disabled. RAD is extremely dangerous. Threats and attempts to maim or kill siblings dangerous. 

It’s fine if you want to stay on your high horse. So that’s the last I’ll say to that."
considering the 20 families that refused her adoption? yes. yes she will.
"well in this case the choice is between having the child grow up 100% in mandated care facilities *or* with a dedicated parent who actively chose to care for the kid, plus the same facilities if needed. From the articles posted here we don't know what the new dad works as and how the kid fits into his life. Given he wrote a book about his life with the girl he may have been a successful author of some type before, who's working from home anyway, just speculating

I mean the child was there already, no extra strain to before the adoption"
">	They have the opinion that [single mothers] should have a partner that works for an income.

I just don't understand this line of thinking. Have these people never met a single mother? It's not exactly easy meeting people when you have kids to care for."
"Hold on, so basically people wanna pressure single mothers to get into unwanted relationships so they can support their children? So a woman loses a husband in a terrible accident and the people now expect her to just jump to the next dude with a job just to survive? What the fuck? Damn, I thought Hollanders were better people."
What does this have to do with the article?
I terminated a DS pregnancy. Can you explain what makes it hard for other people? I had no problems with scheduling (located in Massachusetts)
"It costs $500 and was covered by my insurance as part of a larger genetic screening for the baby. Also, obviously I discussed it with my partner. We were both on the same page: if there is any significant risk of a serious defect or life long health problem that would require significant care, then terminate the pregnancy. No question. I think it’s awful that any child is allowed to be brought into this world with something like Down Syndrome"
But then they'd turn around and give it up for adoption? Now that would be problematic.
"Well I'm definitely *not* advocating for women being forced to make either decision just to be completely clear.

>makes it feel like people don't think their life is worth living.

I don't think that. I think a life without a disability is more worth living."
"Well yeah but 90% of sex crimes being committed by men doesn't mean 90% of men commit sex crimes, obviously. There's still very few men who would commit them"
"that may be true for sex crimes overall (I haven't checked), but what about children specifically, and what about physical/emotional abuse? because I've read that for child abuse in general, it's split 50/50 between mothers and fathers. personally, while I was never abused, my mother was a significantly worse parent than my father in every way. she was cold, distant, critical and obsessed with religion, and very ironically made me feel like an inferior human for being female, while my father always encouraged my dreams and nurtured my intelligence."
That would be op for reposting for karma mate. Not me

As someone whose mom LOVES to tell everyone all about everything going on with “her babies” (usually the bad stuff so she can get sympathy and atta boys for taking care of us from strangers) you develop serious trust issues. Like “Should I talk to my mom about this very serious thing that happened or will she tell the cashier at Walmart with two kids from my high school in the next lane while I’m begging her to stop” kind of issues.
"There’s an Irish family vlog, the Sacconi Jolis(sp) and a few years back they appeared on a big Friday evening TV show in Ireland to talk about it all. They were asked about how the kids were young and couldn’t consent, and how they feel when they were older. I can’t remember how the question was phrased but it was a pretty soft ball question. They replied that this allowed the, to quit their jobs and be with the kids 100% of the time and that was so much of a positive for the kids, they kind of brushed off any suggestion that it could be damaging. From watching it I remember thinking that they didn’t consider it to be a problem at all. There are a lot of kids being exploited on YouTube right now and I’d say some chickens will come home to roost in the future,"
Well...I got news for you. It's almost time to find out.
"The one with the super annoying Dad that thinks he's a rapper was my kiddos obsession. We've banned YouTube on personal devices, and I have to control the TV. My kiddo emulates behavior, and holy shit it was bad."
"When the parents of these YouTube kids get to the point where the family income is literally dependent on them churning out videos it disturbs me greatly wondering what happens if the kids say “hey mum I don’t feel like making a video for a few days”. 

Do the parents pressure the kids into making the videos? If Mums gotten used to a certain standard of living I can totally see her pressuring her kids into making more videos so those YouTube cheques keep rolling in. 

As a commenter before said, these types of parents have always existed and it’s true for sure. But never before have these kids had such intimate details of their lives filmed and uploaded for the whole world to see."
"No offence but.. do you have kids? 

A lucky kid is one whose parents treat their childhood with respect and lets kids be kids. Broadcasting their entire lives to millions is not doing them a favour at all. It’s exploitation pure and simple."
"They sound like awful people. I wouldn't want him to stay with them, so maybe even though they're terrible, it's actually good that they can take him back and find an actual home."
"The shitty thing is they clearly made money off this, and if nothing happens to them, scumbags will see that and hop on the bandwagon 

Doesn't take much for a trend to start"
"Sadly it’s not even a private adoption. It’s called rehoming and it’s gross. 


https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/11/children-who-have-second-adoptions/575902/"
"Fully prepared to get downvoted for this.

It sucks, you're right, but what are they meant to do? It's better for the kid, better for them, and better for their biological kids that they went through with this. It clearly wasn't working out and continuing as they were was never going to end well.

Now the adopted kid has a better chance at being in a happy home and the youtube family may well find themselves better off emotionally too."
fuck. probably better than staying with a slippery slope of escalating abusive parenthood though.
Also known as human trafficking for a lot of young kids who get sold to predators.
"This is so weird. I wasn't aware this was the case anywhere, because where I live, once you adopt a child you have to declare yourself an unfit parent in order to give up parental rights to them. And it doesn't just apply to the one kid you want to give up. It applies to all your kids."
Aka years of therapy.
"Isn't that to encourage adoption because some Russian guy can tell you ""why yes, Alexei is a great kid. Is not like he is going to stab your dog or attempt to rape your daughter. He is absolutely great"".

RAD is one of the scariest and saddest things in the world. Just heartbreaking that it even exists. That family couldn't have been doing a damn thing but making it worse by treating him like that either. I agree it clearly was not a good home for him.
I assume those 20 families adopted and gave a good life to 20 other children.

"I think mostly they don't want to pay benefits for people abusing the system.

Some single mothers in my country on benefits have boyfriends who pretend not to be around so they can get the extra benefits.

It's kind of hard to police. I agree most single mothers will need the benefits though.

Of course, some religious people have problems with the whole concept of single parent families."
"It has everything to do with the comment it is replying to. 
Also: no universal healthcare = harder to take care of a disabled kid with special medical needs = the story in the article much more unlikely."

Thx for the link"
"That really sucks.. a child should be able to go to their parents with anything, how can you when you feel she’ll announce it to the whole world? I know people get set in their ways but for your sake and hers I hope she can change.  Sorry, I know I’m a complete stranger but I’ve seen my friends in similar situations and it really gets under my skin."
"My mother is the same. She has no empathy, but will use anything we tell her to garner sympathy for herself from everyone and anyone. It sucks."
"Yeah that’s fgeetv. I’ll name that name. lol when we got rid of the other family our son quickly discovered Fgeetv. We blocked that also. 

These families that make a buck off their kids weird me out. Yes the kid is playing with toys and they seem happy but who remembers Dad o five or whatever their name was? Turns out that family was abusing one of the five children. Making him the brunt of abuse and videoed it all. That shit had fans."
"It’s quite disturbing because from what I’ve read (I banished those videos entirely in our devices at home and I won’t ever give them one view count at all) this particular channel churns out multiple videos daily. It’s like a sick, real-life Truman Show except the kid’s aware of the cameras but powerless to stop it."
Yeah I have one. Filming everything is one thing but filming toy reviews is another and I might be ok w that bc it’s just what she used to do anyway.
Yeah it's a situation that's horrible but there's also a bright side.
Yup. They just don't get into the city
">They sound like awful people.

This is kinda off topic but it bothers me how quick people are to judge others. I don't really know that much about this incident specifically but in general I've noticed that it seems as if nowadays we have way less privacy and yet people are even less forgiving of others' mistakes."
"So the sheriff's department of their area got a shit ton of calls from people who are PISSED that the Stauffers did this. They put out a press release that he's not missing, not in the foster system, and that the adoption process is being followed. 

https://www.newsweek.com/authorities-confirm-myka-stauffers-rehomed-son-huxley-not-missing-1508725

I was big time worried he would end up like the poor kids that have this happen to them, but it seems like the Stauffers are at least doing this part ""right"". Also I believe CPS is investigating not only little buddy's situation but the health and welfare of the other kids.

Unless something recently happened that I don't know about."
Wow. I just went to their website via this article. One set of parents wanting to re-home their child has the absolute gall to say they are not willing to adopt him out to a gay man (no mention of lesbians so perhaps they don’t exist). How utterly appalling.
"It's not just that they terminated the adoption. It's everything leading up to it. They had a tiny YouTube presence until they started talking adoption. They sat and talked about this kid's trauma, his disabilities, his diagnoses. They grifted money to pay for part of the adoption. They made videos about how this was their son forever, they would never give up on him. She did interviews. She got sponsors because of this child. She has made $$$$ of this poor baby. 

Then she did vlogs about how she doesn't like paying for speech therapy. They won't let him suck his thumb but their bio kids can. Also SURPRISE she had a new baby last year so she gets her two girls and two boys without having to deal with inconvenient little buddy. 

I get the idea that he's better off this way. But in all reality what would really have been better is for them to listen to the experts and not bring this child into their home. Let another family adopt him. 

Instead he gets to deal with the trauma of being abandoned again."
They are meant to stick to the commitment they made to a child. They were meant to take the advice of the medical professionals that warned against it. Maybe if the stupid bitch put down the camera and got off YouTube they’d have had the time to look after the child properly.
"On mobile can’t find story.  

Some woman decided to adopt a severely impaired child against the husbands advice.  After a awhile she decided the daughter was too much trouble, her husband ended up divorcing her, and taking care of the girl till scoliosis (I think) killed her.  He remarried and his new wife cared of the child,  till the child’s death.

Edit: some people adopt children like buying a lamp."
"Yeah, there should absolutely be a way for parents who aren't or don't feel fit to be parents to no longer be responsible for the child. 

But there should be methods in place to ensure they don't have that responsibility in the first place."
"The problem with adopting from Russia, the Ukraine, etc. is a lot of those kids in orphanages suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome and the orphanges did their best to hide it so the kids would get adopted out.  The parents bring the kids home and that's when they discover the issues.  They did this for years and years until the woman in Oklahoma, I think it was Oklahoma, put her kid on a plane and sent him back.  There was such a huge outcry about that but people don't understand how difficult it is to take care of a child with those kinds of issues. Especially if there are other children in the house. It's truly heartbreaking.

Source:  Dated a woman for almost 2 years who adopted a child from the Ukraine who had FAS and didn't know it until she got him home."
"Yeh, this is important.  
Those families aren't assholes for refusing to adopt a child with extremely demanding special needs. In fact if they felt that they didn't have the time, money, and experience to meet her needs then it would be negligent to accept.    
If even they just decided that dedicating literally their entire lives to a child is more than they are willing to sacrifice, I don't think any of us here have enough moral high ground to criticise that. It's an impossible ask.  
I'm sure most of them are good people and will go on to bring a lot of joy into the lives of some fortunate kids."
"I guess people like this exist, but they must be a very rare occurrence.

I've never met a single mother who decided to get pregnant without a father involved. All the single moms I know expected their boyfriend/husband to stick around."
But thats the same across all of central europe
"Id expect from the Bible belt to be opposite, unless it's an ironic Bible belt where no one really knows how to read a Bible."
"Imagine people who have a problem with the concept of women losing their husbands. What the heck. Most people don't choose to be single parents, Jesus Christ. Honestly thought us Europeans are better people than the US, but I guess there's rot everywhere.

Even if mothers have boyfriends, mother having a boyfriend doesn't automatically mean the child has a father or that the boyfriend agrees to support the child in any way. Jesus."
The US has Medicare to give free healthcare to children (CHIP program)
It is a hard decision.
Well it's just sad how ostracized it is for a single dad to wanna adopt. It's something I would consider but after this thread not so sure if I ever would
Lmao when you put it that way it sounds ridiculous doesn't it lol
"Yup! That dad is the most annoying human I've been subjected to. The kids are adorable, but it seems like dad wants his 15 minutes at any cost.



My much much younger brother watched Daddyofive, and it gave me that gross pit of the stomach feeling, so my mom banned that one like 6 months before all the controversy started."
"Filming toy reviews for home video to reflect on in 20 years or to share with grandparents ? Totally wholesome and cool. 

Uploading it to YouTube for millions of strangers to watch? The kids have no understanding of why that could be bad and the parents shouldn’t be making that decision on their behalf. 

But of course when money enters the equation some parents do make that choice for their kids because all they can see is money. It’s selfish and wrong imo."
"Oh, of course, I wasn't intending to come across like I was defending them vlogging about the kid (although I will say that such a vlog series could be tastefully done) and the unsavoury discrimination they showed in how they treated their bio kids and the adopted kid."
the fact that the guy who didn’t agree to the adoption stepped up and did the right thing for another human being says a lot about him
Classic ‘some woman’

"I have a cousin (in law), who is 30 years old, with Downs. I can’t imagine my life without him in it to some capacity. In that way it gives me pause to think that if I were told my child would be born with the same disorder that I could simply end that life. I am not a religious person, but I have seen how fruitful his life is. Is it difficult? Yes. But who am I to shy away from that difficulty when it’s not my life? At the same time I would never shame anyone else for making a different decision, nor would I make it for my wife."

Who are you to give that difficulty to someone when it's not your life or to speak of *your* pleasure from their existence? It's not about you.

Regardless we're not talking about going back in time and aborting lives that already have fulfillment in them. We're talking about existing *fetuses*.

The way I see it there are a finite number of ""slots"" for human lives to fit into. There are only so many parents to go around. Aborting a fetus with a lifelong genetic disability doesn't reduce the amount of human happiness in the world because a loving family that wants a child isn't going to let one failed attempt stop them."

"You can even use uBlock's custom filters to stop garbage like Pinterest from polluting your search results. All around woderful, must have tool.

I wish there was a Ublock app on android..
I recommend Nano Adblocker + Nano Defender. it's a fork of uBlock Origin that circumvents anti-adblockers and has some additional features.
How do you block the websites that are blocking for using an adblocker? And I have Firefox with greasemonkey ablock killer scripts running...doesn't work.
You either die an adblocker or you live long enough to become the ad
what other choice do we have?
"I certainly hope you're kidding, the whole point of the extension is to stop ads and instead it literally pops up bigger than any other ad on a website, exactly what it's meant to prevent."
"I don't usually post things like this but i instantly thought of assholedesign when i saw this, because in my opinion it is undeniably bullshit"
"That's an unbelievably round number, too. Blocking tens of thousands of ads is believable, but not precisely 10,000."
"Started using a pi-hole a few months ago. I will never go back to anything else. Blocks ads on everything in my network, phones, computers, tablets, televisions... I like the whole network solution."
"NY Post sucks

It's not an either/or."
"ublock origins is an extension that requires the same amount of clicks as this, how is it not as plug and play?"
"That's just every antivirus program. Like, try uninstalling Avast as a layman, good luck lol"
"No, except that we don't typically like pop-up advertisements. What if every single piece of code on your computer spammed you with pop-ups?"
*unlock orgin
"swapped from chrome to firefox and just tried it out basically, clearly regret that choice."
Trying new stuff is smart. Going to ublocker from my old blocker (which worked pretty well) was smart too.
"Tbh , uBlock origins is not that effective as it used to be at least for me , it's also kinda buggy now , i dunno why but I'm noticing how certain many adds on some of the regular websites i visit are able to filtrate through the program."
"I hope you've been using ublock origin, not ublock."
a red shield isn’t exactly a unique innovative design
"It is. Open source and has no company behind it, so it doesn't accept money to show ""acceptable"" ads like ABP and others do"
uBlock Origin is better than abp nowadays. I think abp had some shady shit in it.
"Way better. ABP was what I used for years, until I discovered uBlock Origin. It's more lightweight (uses less of your computers resources), and blocks more ads."
"ublock or ublock origin? You want origin, the other one was stolen and sucks.

I can't remember the last ad I've seen on my computer, it's nice."
reinstalling unlock origin fixes the issue for me.
The power combo
[Apparently brave has some privacy problems.](https://fosstodon.org/@mike/104301307584278449) Why not use firefox+uBlock Origin? It's better.
[Brave is not a good solution.](https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2020/06/06/the-brave-web-browser-is-hijacking-links-and-inserting-affiliate-codes/)
"Sketchy as hell that Brave bullshit

https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2020/06/06/the-brave-web-browser-is-hijacking-links-and-inserting-affiliate-codes/"
Brave? You should look at [this first](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/gy8ac5/the_brave_web_browser_is_hijacking_links_and/)
"Most poeple are ignoring the 'do not show this again' square, but don't let me stop the circle-jerk"
"Yeah... Others adblocks should not even try anymore.
Now I just wish Unlock could work on windows native, and stop windows from being bullshit"
Thanks a ton
"Yep, I use it to block Reddit's new and dumb profile picture and hover-over username feature."
Where in uBlock origin do I put this line if you dont mind me asking?
I think I'm the only redditor who uses pinterest. I actually have an extention that allows me to pin any image on chrome to my pinterest haha.
Firefox on Android supports extensions so I run it with uBlock Origin.
"Been using this for a couple years, never looked back."
Will look at it as well!
a trace buster buster buster
"It does it once. In forever. It’s a free service, they need money. Asking a single time for a donation or download is not an issue. Considering that the other way for an adblocker to make money is through an Ad Whitelist (basically advertisers pay for their ads not to be blocked), I’d prefer the asking method."
One time.
"Agreed, never changed any setting in uBlock and I am very happy with it."
It also has an incredible amount of other functions that its mostly designed for. If you really use it just as just a adblocker it's a gross misuse of the application.
~~We need a /r/IAmEasilyImpressedByUseOfNegativeSpace
You have a point.
\*uBlock origin
"FYI: ublock origin is on Firefox, too"
"Regret that shitty blocker I suppose, not Firefox."
"Hey word to the wise. uBO is really good. And sometimes so good that it occasionally stops some of the desired functions of websites like ""login with Google"" and some overlay ""pop ups"". Just remember that if something is weird or not working to pause it.

I'd spent about 10 minutes last week trying to get a site to open up when I was buying a gift for a friend. Turns out the checkout was on an overlay and didn't wanna work with uBO

It's not all sites just something different with their programming maybe? I'm not a programmer so I have no idea the true cause."
"Idk i love firefox blocks a lot more shit than chrome
and also there must be some better adblocker on firefox"
If you haven’t yet try Ghosterly. Blocks pops ups and trackers and stuff too. Doesn’t outright get rid of ads but it’s really great on Firefox
"yep... it's just it sooo happens to mimic the lead tool in that category, what a coincidence..."
If i wanted to continue supporting youtubers i like is there a way to whitelist them on ubo?
I still don't understand what they did even after reading several articles.
"who tf is mike stone and why should I care if he doesn't want to use a browser? 

and who is david gerard? and why should I give a shit what he says on davidgerard.co.uk (what couldn't spring for a dot com buddy?)"
"uh I don't use cryptocurrancy so I don't care if they but ""binance"" in a url..."
"My father downloaded brave on my new computer, is it bad?"
Fortunate I don’t have to worry about this garbage with Safari.
It's just a poor implementation of their affiliate link when you enable brave rewards. Just because they had this mishap doesn't mean the browser is bad or doesn't have redeeming qualities.
Anything cryptocurrency is sketchy as hell.
PiHole all the way.  Grabbed a Raspberry Pi Zero with kit for 30 bucks and it took 15 minutes from opening to pihole blocking ads.
that's what the HOSTS file is for
NextDNS works well if you don't want to buy a PiHole.
Just use old Reddit to avoid all that shit. You can change it back to the original design in user preferences.
"""My filters"" or something among those lines. My system language isn't English so i don't know for sure what its called in other languages."
"In the 'my filters' section of uBlock Origin, add those. Each one on separate lines. Then save (ctrl+s)"
"It's not about being against using pinterest, if it's useful for you, use it.

The hate is from google image search showing mostly pinterest results these days.

When looking for an image, I want to see the original source, not some random person ""bookmarks"". Not to mention it hurts the original creators who don't get the traffic (ad revenue) or credit from the pinteress result.

So, similar to OP I have an extension to remove all pinteress results from my searches. Something google should do by default imo."
"'Firefox Preview' . Not 'Firefox'

The 1st one is newer and MUCH faster. And better."
What would you do if someone tried to fuck with you in your own house!
"it also puts ads infront of youtube videos to make it look like they are meant to be there, which doesn't have an option to stop."
"Ublock does all this without nagging you, so yes, it is asshole."
Shut up gatekeeper. Works great as an adblocker and if you don't need the other shit it's fine to not use those features. Fuck you
*urinal orgasm
"honestly dnno why i still have chrome when firefox works faster

some other nice extensions to get on firefox

privacy badger

my favourite - cookie autodelete (take care with using this one)

decentraleyes 

tree style tab

impulse blocker

multi-account container

facebook container"
"Considering they said they switched to ublock, I’m pretty sure they know that…"
"is the lead tool no longer adblock plus? reddit isn’t the world, you know

plenty of other adblock extensions use red shields too"
"Frankly youtube ad revenue is a lot cause anyways, just doing $0.50 a month on patreon is an order of magnitude more than what the creator would get from ads."
Yes you can go into the panel for the add on and set a whitelist using a wildcard for each channel you want to whitelist.
Yes there is
Signup for YouTube Premium
They made normal links affiliate links.
chill bro
You shouldn't. It's just an explanation.
Firefox/Chromium + uBlock origin will always be better.
"appart from the links hijacking stuff, it's not that great. It's actually faster that Firefox sometimes but i encountered so many bugs and crashes i gave up. Also Brave Rewards is useless, unless you wanna earn 5 bucks every six months (considering you'll use Brave everyday)"
"Nope, fuck em. Why use it when you have Firefox? All of that brave business model, etc. sounds sketchy as hell."
I use a combination of ublock and pihole. Pihole gets about 95% while ublock gets the rest.
Does it work with YouTube ads? Since those are always different
Not for the build in ads
You can run pihole on devices that aren't raspberry pis too. I've got it running on my home Linux server.
"Your other comment said it only did it once a day. I mean, that’s still a little asshole-ish, but not enough to warrant being on this sub. Falls into more of a grey area. Like I said, many adblockers have Ad Whitelists, like ADB Plus’s Acceptable Ads program.

Anyways, I just installed it on firefox and tried to watch a few different youtube videos. Zero ads. I didn’t do very extensive testing, though. Maybe messed around for 7-8 minutes with it."
Just because a service does its job better doesn’t mean an inferior service is asshole-ish. Just because I don’t own a Porsche or Lamborghini doesn’t make any Ford or Toyota I own a shitty car.
Just because a tool works good for something. Does not mean that it's the intended use. Im sorry if that's not abundantly clear.
"I was an avid Chrome user for many years. When it came out it was great.

Now it's become the thing it was meant to fight. It's worse than Edge today."
Only reason I use chrome is for flash games.  For some reason firefox is shit with them
Another big one is that Firefox uses Https for DNS.
"There are also other tab container extensions based on Facebook Container. There are some for Reddit (Reddit does a lot of tracking), Amazon, and Google (a huge tracker because of their ad network) for example"
HTTPS Everywhere is also a good one.
"You should check out Vivaldi, especially if [tan management](https://vivaldi.com/blog/tab-management-tricks-vivaldi/) is something you like.

It’s based on chromium, so you can use any chrome extension with it (privacy badger, cookie auto delete and decentraleyes are all on chrome).

I tried it instead of Firefox few months ago and I haven’t looked back, it’s a great browser."
I love panorama group tabs.
"Tree style tab....

Sounds awesome, might be the thing to make me swap again"
I would consider the new MS Edge. I was surprised at how fast it feels.
Social fixer - makes Facebook usable again.
I enjoy the shodan extension too. The extension will tell you were the website is hosted. Who owns the ip and what ports are open
Because eventually Firefox will bloat itself and Chrome will be the light and fast one. It’s a continuous cycle.
Ad nauseum is awesome too
"> is the lead tool no longer adblock plus?

They sold out and started sipping ads and going through ""fair ad practices"" that weren't in tune with my views, so I stoped adblock plus years ago."
I’d love to do that but i’m a jobless child lol
"So like clicking on anything from say, a YouTube ""reviewer""?"
"sorry. I don't put much stock in what anyone says at ""theirname.co.uk""

lmfao. might as well read creed bratton's blog at that point."
"I'm for sure not installing an chromium, it installs some weird bar on top of my screen (out of topic but: sometimes when i download stuff that come with virus it also comes with chromium)Soo yeah I have had a bad experience with chromium lol"
Why Firefox and not chrome? (Just asking to know lol) everyone always told me chrome is the best one but tbh nobody told me why
"On iPad and iPhone, you can’t install extensions to Firefox so I’m forced to use Brave."
"Scrolling in Firefox is absolute dog shit. Until they get the basics right, I'm staying with chromium"
Mostly yes.
"okay but ad whitelists are asshole design when the whole point of your program is to block ads, adblock plus especially (considering they're literally the ones who made the adblock blocker). as far as i'm aware, ublock origin is the only one worth a shit"
"Oh, only once a day. Please, make a line for your mandatory once-in-a-week anal probing."
Unless the doing the job better constitutes mostly of not shoving ads to your face
Tell me one good reason why someone shouldn't use ublock as just a plug-and-play adblocker
Funny you say that because the new Edge is based on the same open source platform chrome was written in... Chromium.
It's clearly not worse than Edge and you know it
"not for long..
google is gonna remove flash player support by the end of this year."
"Don’t nearly all browsers do this? I’ve seen https in nearly all my DNS inputs on chrome, or am I missing something?"
"Bonus: Vivaldi is made by the original Opera devs, which was leading browser tech in the 2000s and introduced a lot of features that other browsers copied - and some didn't even make it to the modern browsers (minus Vivaldi), like tab groups which are insanely useful if you are like me and just never close tabs."
"I don't see many people talk about Vivaldi here on Reddit. I love this browser so much - after I started using it I feel annoyed when I need to go back to Chrome for something.

Too bad the mobile version works so poorly. It crashes all the time for me so I've gone back to using Chrome on my phone."
The sidebar is the only reason I can't switch anymore.
"Nah. I'm not gonna waste my computer's resources to click on every ad in the background to supposedly ""upset"" the advertisers."
I use Ad Nauseam myself and haven't been able to complain yet.
"right, me too. i just figured that by “lead” you were referring to general popularity instead of whichever one you think is better"
"You mean this thing you can **opt out of** https://i.imgur.com/aQHQF85.png, the one that encourages website owners to have non intrusive and non annoying ads. They have to pay the bills, cause we are browsing for free, so I'm fine with non-intrusive ads."
"Fair lol. I guess you could just turn off the blocker and refresh the page, or even just leave the blocker off and only turn it on when you're annoyed with an ad."
Yeah. Only that this is automatic and it's for brave.
.co.(insert country code here) is basically regional .com. You can trust it as much as a .com site(you can't). Also the article is just an explanation of the problem.
"That's not chromiums fault, it's yours for downloading and installing sketchy shit. They include it because it's free and they can make it do ad/affiliate things for them as part of normal operation."
Chromium is basically the base that Chrome is built on. It’s free to use and many other browsers are built on top of chromium. So adware often installs chromium with tons of adware extensions preinstalled. The actual browser Chromium isn’t at fault
"Chrome collects a shit ton of data of you, Firefox doesn't.

Also Firefox is the only major browser that doesn't use chromium, so while Firefox stays alive Google doesn't get to decide all web standards, and let's be honest here, no single company should have control over all web standards."
"Chromium is really bad with resource management, while firefox is more lightweight and can run on old systems. Firefox is actually usually faster too."
"Chrome is best if you're heavily invested in the Google ecosystem (Gmail, Drive, Calendar, etc) but for privacy-conscious people it's not all that great."
"Tried Firefox Preview once again, and then rip."
"Not sure if iOS has this but android also has ""Firefox preview"". Both allow you to install extensions but if it's on the app store you might want to try it."
"I don’t disagree. But not all AdBlockers are nonprofit like uBlock Origins is, and they have to make money somehow. I’m not excusing the behavior, just explaining why it exists."
"Indeed. That’s not the case here, though. The AdBlocker is not being obtrusive. It asks once, and is done if you click the box."
"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-%E2%80%94-best-ad-blocker/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom

Because you might as well use this."
"It's also faster. For what I need it for, Edge was just an easy swap over really. Still have all my (few) extensions for anti-virus and such."
"And Chromium is a fork from Apple’s WebKit. 

Which was forked from the KDE HTML and JS engines

And I think somehow all goes back to Netscape Navigator, but I can’t remember the exact links."
The new edge beta isn't bad. I've been using it for a while to see how good it is.
"I mean, its run by the King of Spyware companies, so it kind of is."
"I use Vivaldi to upload photos to IG from my computer. It has a ""mobile like"" version of the site that allows you to do this, easily. That's cool."
But it takes you to the same page you were trying to go to in the first place?
"Oh ok, thanks for the info"
"Wait,data from me? Like the stuff that I download Or watch?, Like the targeted ads thingy?"
"I just stated you can't do that on iOS.

No 3rd party extensions on apps at all."
"Not really our problem as consumers that they have a shitty business model though. It's well within the bounds of asshole design when the design is intentionally assholish. Want to make money? Don't make an extension that blocks your revenue, it should be common sense, surely"
"That is not a good reason. You don't see any benefit to a chrome extension being open source? 

""You shouldn't use this program because you could use this other program with less features"" isn't a very strong argument.

Also ublock origin doesn't have the ""acceptable ads"" program where they let some ads through. If you truly want no ads, ublock origin is a better option."
If you've got an Android phone then that's clearly not a genuine concern
"No it's not. It'd a virus. Minecraft mods are ALMOST NEVER supposed to be executed directly, instead they should be installed with forge or fabric. Optifine is the only mod I can think of that has it's own installer, and still then full releases of optifine are forge compatible."
"Yes, everything."
So just use safari. Everything is same thing with reskin.
If you cant manage to use unlock orgins for anything other then an adblocker i doubt you care about open source.
0of then
"Dang, yeah I'll be switching lmao"
"Um... what kind of phone do you have? I got some bad news, and your browsing history is the least of it..."
Baseless claim. Chrome does not help google track you. You’ll be just as tracked with any other browser.
"Ok so can you tell why that’s a problem? Maybe it’s just me, but I really don’t understand the huge issue everyone is making out of this.

Edit: And btw, “Targeted ads” is such a buzz word. It’s no different and perhaps even better than normal ads. And with how common adblockers are, it doesn’t even matter."
"I still can't find a reason to not use ublock origins over a generic adblocker. It just seems like you're trying to protect your little elitist club of people who know how to use these forbidden features. 

Just like people trying to stay quiet about reddit in order to ""protect"" it from the ""normies""."

But you’re not. I’m here to help you. I promised Gandalf that I would.

" Stop it! Leave him alone! Don’t you understand? He’s got to destroy it! That’s where we’re going, into Mordor. To the Mountain of Fire!...Please. It’s such a burden. Will you not help him?"
What sort of weddings do they have?
They brought something to just words better then what your doing.
What’s to ruin? There’s hardly any meat on ‘em.
Maybe I can carry it for a while... Share the load
Sam could have destroyed the ring with a loaf of old bread.  The rest needed to cast it into the fire.  Sam didn't want to insult the rest because he was op.

If it’s not in his financial interest then he doesn’t care.
"He cares for human rights that affect *him*, like blm.  But Asians living on the other side of the world?  He couldn't give a single fuck.

The hypocrisy is frustrating.  He expects white people to understand his blm arguments, but he won't do it himself for the human rights of other groups."
It's very easy to stand up for oppressed people when it doesn't affect your income. When there are actual consequences celebrities are suddenly silent.
"Idk why people are surprised, wealthy people do this all the time money>human rights. Just so happens that Lebron is popular. Like this ain’t nothing new man."
Someone cross post this to r/NBA for maximum carnage.
I don't see anyone boycotting Disney.
"Lebron should reiterate his stance that we're ""not educated about the situation"".

Hypocrite."
"2 weeks ago I got downvoted over 300x for this comment

So just to be clear, LeBron James says it's ok to speak out against police brutality against black people but not Chinese oppression in Hong Kong. Everyone sees this?"
You saw the backlash that Daryl Morey got for going against the China-NBA money connection.
"They're 100% right. LeFraud loves all of the money he is milking out of China far more than caring about the human rights abuses inflicted by that country. When it comes to matters that don't potentially jeopardise his earnings, he's the ultimate champion of the oppressed people."
"It's true, same with Beyonce. Both full of shit and dont deserve a platform ok these issues."
"*""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. But justice takes a backseat to your bottom line. Always.""* -LeBron James"
"Reddit loves to paint in black and white, angels or demons. People are hardly ever that simple. Mind blowing as it may sound it is possible to be both self interested and philanthropic and not just consecutively but concurrently."
Man feels more concerned about issues mining his own ethnicity in his own country than strangers he has little/nothing to do with. More at 9
"I’m not even a LeBron fan but to expect perfection for every response it total horseshit. To act like he doesn’t care at all when a founded a freaking promise school that will give thousands of underserved kids a chance to go to college is mind numbingly stupid.

Is he perfect? No.

Does he give a shit? Yes."
"And Hong Kong didn't care about civil rights and police brutality in the Black Community until George Floyd.


No White Athlete is being told to do this.  



Where's Brady? Where's the FIFA stars?  What about Sidney Crosby?

JJ Watt?  Euros?  How about the white Euro  FIFA stars?

None of these guys have said anything and every clown with 4k copies of Joker is upvoting this stupid story with the  smug satisfaction of a first time Ayn Rand reader.


This idiocy is from the same kids who loved ""Jussie"" stories and want to paint black athletes as hypocrites. 

When equality is reached in America, Lebron can work on Hong Kong."
As much as you guys excuse Trump's imperfections don't be surprised when we the black community excuse this for LeBron.
https://www.zerohedge.com/technology/reddit-circulates-china-bootlickers-list-after-zoom-licks-chinas-boots. Apparently reddit won’t post this
"How about this, stop looking to celebrities for their support on various issues and start focusing on support in your community."
I love him but he needs to do the right thing. He needs to call out China for their human rights violations.
"If you ever think an ultra-rich person cares more for a cause than their bottom-line, you're sadly mistaken."
"It’s not hypocritical to care more about how your own people are affected by oppression by the country you live in than a how a different group of people are affected in a country half way across the world.

Would it be great if Lebron stood up for Hong Kong? Yes. But he’s not a hypocrite for fighting for a future where his children don’t have to live in fear of the police. 

I understand this is something most redditors won’t really understand, because most of y’all are white and therefore are bystanders on most issues. To you guys standing up for BLM and Hong Kong mean similar things, something that doesn’t effect you personally but you agree with. It’s different if you’re black. This is a matter of life and death, and has been since 1619. Your investment in BLM isn’t going to be the same in Hong Kong. It’s just not."
"Wow, it's like not one single celebrity or company actually gives one fuck about you or your movements. 

You're a fucking moron to think otherwise."
Seems like most rich people do stupid shit but he’s done a lot more good than most people
Instead of criticizing other world leaders of major powers that can actually cause change or put pressure on China they target Lebron James of all people. He can come out tomorrow praising the protesters and absolutely nothing will change. In 2047 when their Basic laws expire and they loose their legal autonomy the world will look the other way when China takes control.
"What does LeBron have to do with Hong Kong?  Outside of basketball, do folks there know anything about black people?"
He doesn't care about everyone's civil rights he only cares about the issues that are close to him. It's not really a surprise that he's pro BLM when I'm sure when he was growing up as a poor and in a single parent house hold he would totally be on board with.
"Its also quite possible is that all he cares about is defending black people.  Which i dont blame him if that's the case, nor does it mean he's racist.  Just means he's not an equal opportunity political activist."
I think the writer of this article is uneducated on the issue.
"Space Jam 2 needs to open in a China so he’s gotta pick... 

Human rights or Box Office Success? I think he’ll pick the latter"
People just finding this out?
"People saying here what he said is for the money and he’s a hypocrite is just the same old rhetoric. 

He, along with many other players and staff were in China when Morey spoke out, if y’all so informed you know how can China in an instant take you as a prisoner or make you mysteriously disappear, or simply mess you up in so many ways. That’s the context on why LeBron called Morey uninformed or ignorant. 

Do I think it would be better he wouldn’t have said anything? Totally. 

Do I think he should say something? I don’t think there’s a way he can, it’s god damn China we’re talking about. BLM is a miniature movement compared on what’s going on over there and the consequences of him saying anything could have quite a bad effect on many people. The truth is, no matter how big of an activist a public person is, there’s a power out there that’s gonna make them shut the fuck up unless they wanna lose everything and create chaos, in this case it was China. 

There’s a reason on why many high profile public persons and politicians have not said a word against China."
"ITT, everyone criticizing Lebron, and other black celebrities for not talking about Hong Kong. What about all the white ones? Where is the hypocrisy in all of you?

And why Is Hong Kong celebrated as some ultimate evil of the Chinese government? They literally have concentration camps for Muslims that have been ongoing for half a decade. They’re committing a cultural and literal genocide agaist the Uyghurs. State sanctioned rape by Han men against Urghur women. Why the fuck is no one talking about that? 

The fuck is LeBron supposed to do? The people with most power are the whites that run this country. Meanwhile Ivanka is getting all her patents fast tracked and other kick backs from the Chinese government."
If they think he only cares about money they should meet Michael Jordan.
"Good. He deserves to be called out for the phony he is.

He left the Hong Kong protesters high and dry, yet claims to be against all forms of inequality."
Hong kong takes aim at the one of the most successful black businessman who values profits over human rights while ignoring every other white one thats been in business with China for centuries despite the human rights record. Where do you think he learned business from?
"This controversy feels very manufactured to me. It would be in our government’s interest to direct attention away from our own crisis and try to get you worried about some protest that has nothing to do with you - and here’s the kicker there’s nothing you can do about it. You can direct all the ire at Lebron and China all you want but we will never affect that conflict. There are actual issues going on right now we can be a part of in our own backyards but instead we’re getting mad that a basketball player doesn’t care about this issue without ever questioning how much energy we’re devoting to it ourselves.

Don’t even get me started on everyone trying to equalize the two protests by saying oh he thinks black lives matter but what about HK. The people of HK have not experienced anything close to the oppression black Americans have faced in this country and our police crackdowns have made theirs look like child’s play."
God forbid a black man in America cares about black rights in America more than he cares about Hong Kong rights.
"We all have already said this, but now j worry right wing media will just use it to tell LeBron to shut up and dribble again."
A lot of new accounts roaming this bizarre thread
Article is all over the place why would Lebron even touch on the topic?  What do they want from him basketball lessons?
LeBron is a scumbag through and through. He's fake AF and greedy as hell. He cares more about money and his image than winning.
They aren’t wrong. He was fairly clear a out this with his actions.
This argument would apply to all the rioters and protesters in America. They’re all hypocrites then not just Lebron. The fact is the majority of people in the US (myself included) are not as empathic with Hong Kong because it has no affect on OUR day to day life.
"U mean ""99% celebs don't give a single fuck about anything, and just want to make some good PR out of real human tragedy""? Nah, no way."
"HK protesters don't care about human rights. They're a color revolution backed by the US for the purposes of undermining the PRC and ensuring that multinational corporations continue to have a base in China for effectively managing and coordinating their exploitation of labor around the world. 

They've been protesting for a year all because of the fact that Beijing felt that a murderer from the ROC *shouldn't* be able to just escape justice. 

Meanwhile on the HK sub (the color revolution one not the Sino one) they get all fragile and claim that the world supports BLM over them in spite of the fact that black activists in the US have been demonized for years on end. I remember countless threads around the times of Ferguson and Baltimore and the murder of Trayvon Martin where people on this site would fucking fantasize about running black people over because they're protesting and in their way. Meanwhile everything goes out the window with HK because ""China Bad"".

HK protesters try to act like they have solidarity around the world but Estallido Social in Chile wants nothing to do with HK because they're fighting against the forces of neoliberalism while HK is trying to combat the one world power that is actually making material progress (however slow) in building socialism. 

Then when it comes to BLM here, the HKers might say a nice word or two but on Twitter and Chinese social media they say the most awful and racist things about black Americans fighting for their own justice and liberation. 

I doubt many comrades will see this comment, but if this struck a chord with you, before you get mad, I encourage you to do some independent digging and research on this issue."
This article and that guy’s tweet are so basic and unfounded. It’s like just his opinion man
"Economy Culture - Financials drive perceptions.

I can't find the Podcast, I thought it was Kavitha from The Lead...but I recall listening to an episode in which the NBA is so hardcore into China right now that they hiring pretty much any executive fluent in Mandarin."
"Breaking news: Rich person doesn't care about the proles, more on this *shocking* story at the top of the hour."
"Good, fuck that clown."
"I see it's ""dunk"" on black people thread, because they are representative of every single cause in the existence of humanity.

While people in this thread don't even donate a dime to anyone."
"Damn give LeBron a break, he doesn’t have to speak for hk"
This is more about taking down a black leader than helping Hong Kong. See right through all this bullshit.
Who gives a fuck about a basketball player? Really? Guy is as dumb as rocks and got rich bouncing a ball. Anyone listening to him is an idiot.
r/nba has entered the chat...
A true american these days
Fair point. I always find these headlines weird though. Like which activists said that? I mean for this quote I could see most of them feeling like that but these headlines always make it seem like an entire city wide crowd shouted it at once.
"Just like all the companies with Black Lives Matter, wait until is extremely popular and uncontroversial, just like pride month they’ll all back away come July 1st."
"It’s as if everyone is hypocritical, some more than others.  It’s not like Lebron has military backing or anything to help Hong Kong. It’s like asking Ja Rule for his thoughts on an issue. The fuck is Ja Rule gonna do?  The current president isn’t gonna do anything to help HK. I support HK but what can I really do?"
He will financially recover from this.
"It’s not like Lebron said “Hey, CCP members buy sneakers too”"
This is why NBA is trying to business in China despite the clear moral problems with it.
"Like the songs say, ""Cash Rules Everything Around Me"""
"I actually disagree with this post.  Lebron James has done a huge amount of philanthropy work and given away enormous sums of money - be it through his I Promise School, The Muhammad Ali Exhibit, ONEXONE, and numerous other initiatives.

The issue is that people are complicated and don't support every cause equally.  I strongly disagree with Lebron's position on Hong Kong but people are complicated and I don't think you can simplify it to ""If it's not in his financial interest than he doesn't care"".  He cares about the issues that are close to him - Black Lives Matter, public education in the US, children growing up without a support system.  This doesn't excuse his stance on Hong Kong, but people aren't black and white.  I mean hell, even Gandhi had numerous problematic points of view."
"Being born and raised in Akron, Ohio (Lebron’s home town), I can assure you that he does A LOT for the community. When he was a rookie, not so much. But as he’s matured as a person he has given back to the community greatly. He still owes my wife $10 from when he stiffed her at Cracker Barrel 15 years ago."
"This is why it pissed off when he went of on Drew Brees as long as he did. 

Did Brees say some shit? Sure, but you just have to look at the way his teammates, Cam Jordan in particular, handled the situation to see LeBron was playing it up. When someone explained what they were doing to him, Brees got the point pretty quickly. 

Lebron is a loudmouth asshole and I don't know why people defend him."
Unfortunately this is probably the case for most ppl
"That’s why he’s been pretending to be a nice guy this last year or so. Lebron, AKA LeMao the Qing, is so full of shit."
"Its not even just that, he was lecturing people on the subject which basically amounted to ""fuck your freedom of speech if it actually affects my bottom line.""


>“Yes, we all do have freedom of speech. But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you’re not thinking about others and you’re only thinking about yourself. I don’t want to get into a feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke.

>“So many people could have been harmed — not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually. Just be careful about what we tweet, what we say and what we do. Yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.”"
"Asians living on the other side of the world?

Nah, he doesn't even give a fuck about Asians living in his neighborhood"

"Somewhat on the flip side of this, I work for a Chinese online English company, and on their official facebook page for teachers they've been allowing posts about BLM and the protests, despite a ban on political posts in the group.  The other day I posted a news article about the Tiananmen Square vigil they had in Hong Kong, possibly the last we will see there to commemorate the massacre.  Well, guess what? It was swiftly taken down by admins. So the message is, it's good to promote protests and socio-political change, as long as it doesn't affect the company's bottom line. Such hypocrisy."
"Take a look at the ShutdownSTEM website

In their statement they seperate black and non black POC and demand that whites and non black POCs need to “educate themselves” and “define a detailed plan of action to carry forward”.

This whole BLM complex seems to want further separation and splintering of society.

Imagine a group wanting to highlight oppression but seeking to exclude the possibility of working with others who’ve suffered oppression to develop a holistic and unified stance.

Seems like a big fuck you to Native Americans, the Latin community, Jews, Muslims post 9/11 etc etc."
"I expect white people to understand BLM arguments because they are decent human beings, not because Lebron said so"
"They hypocrisy if this post is amazing but not surprising. 

This is Reddit where people FOR YEARS said that BLM were terrorists.  Where people for years said that BLM marching in the street is bad because it's blocking the streets.  I can't tell you how many times in here I've seen Reddit posters say BLM should be more like Martin Luther King as if King didn't March in the streets.

I can't tell you how many times the knee jerk reaction on here was to believe anything the cops said about a person they killed.  Hell the only reason you don't have that with George Floyd is because it was OBVIOUS he was already in custody when he was killed. 


So now here we are.....a bunch of white people that would look for every reason to discount what Black people go through SUDDENLY upset that a Black man didn't do enough in their eyes to care about people on the other side of the world.

If I told you how many times Black people have pointed out how whites love to focus on other countries while COMPLETELY IGNORING the human rights abuses happening around the corner from them it would make your head spin."
"Is that hypocrisy? 

He expects white Americans to understand that presumably. That’s the same country."
Nothing like hearing how I am oppressing someone who makes more in a single month than I ever will over the coarse of my entire life.
That's when 'human rights' turns into identity politics.  Really wished the American left would move away from identity politics and get back to principles.
"BLM didn't give a shit about Asian racism during COVID-19, yet BTS (Korean pop group) still gave them a mill and helped troll the tag #alllivesmatter for them on Twitter. 

That's real big if Asisns."
Tbh Lebron really only speaks out when its black lives killed by someone who isn't black. All of these celebs are silent when it comes to how do we fix things inside the black community....
I think you’re expecting too much from him. Honestly he’s just a dude that’s good at basketball. He probably knows fuck all about much else. It’s not that he “doesn’t give a fuck about Asians” he’s just dumb.
"He actually gave a fuck tho, else he wouldn't whine about potential money lost from CCP market."
"I mean, in all fairness, he doesn't *actually* believe in human rights."
same goes for corporations. its easy to make money if you don't mind fucking people over and behaving unethically.
"It’s especially sad because of how rich LeBron is. He doesn’t need more money, but his morality is enslaved to earning more. If he never earned another cent he’d still be fabulously wealthy forever...but it’s not enough to free him from the leash of wealthier investors"
This is why my favorite celebrities are people like Muhammad Ali who actually suffered real consequences for the stands they took and stuck to their guns.
nah the only reason he probably wasted time on blm is because his money handlers told him it would be a good way to advertise himself and make more money
If LeBron had stayed silent about HK it would have been an improvement
"The point is he quotes MLK’s “Injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere” and he criticizes Morey for tweeting about HK protests, yet he claims to be more than just a player. Sure, a lotta people are hypocrites but he brands himself as someone with morals, so that makes him seem like a real bitch"
"Not at all new, but absolutely should be exposed and commented on often so it doesn’t take the next generation half a lifetime to figure it out. Young impressionable lebron fans should know."
i TaKe ReSpOnSiBiLiTy
"What wealthy people do isn't new but society has more and more idolized the wealthy with celebrity culture. The guy plays a game where he puts a ball in a hoop. He does it extremely well, but somehow that translates to millions of people idolizing him and his thoughts on things he has little knowledge about. As Charles Barkley said, ""I'm not a role model. Just because I dunk a basketball doesn't mean I should raise your kids."""
Weathly people? Try everyone
"People for some reason expect their sporting athlete idols to also be pillars of moral infallibility, as well."
It is because he has cashed in on a carefully constructed human rights brand. Most of these other people you talk about haven't made millions off this type of branding. Just look at his whole Nike marketing platform. LeBron is an activist for human rights when it helps his pocket book and image. He is an ultimate hypocrite.
"To be fair, most people do this. Money > just about everything"
"I don’t think people are surprised, if here just calling him out, which is what they should do. Pouting out how money is more important to these people than human rights helps bring awareness to that. So the next time someone says “eat the rich” maybe more people will agree."
This was thoroughly discussed 8 months ago when LeBron actually made the comments about Morey. Everyone was bothered by it and criticized him.
"r/nba would agree with this article, largely."
It already got removed from there the other day.
It already got posted there a few days ago.
"Or how many people here use iPhone, or use clothing made in Chinese sweatshops, people just want to be mad at someone"
A lot of the anti-China assholes in this thread will be first in line for the next Marvel movie that hits theaters. They want to pick on LeBron for not taking a hard stance on an issue that doesn't impact him and that he doesn't know anything about. It's like if I went to a BLM protest and started yelling at everyone because they weren't protesting against fracking too.
"Because that affects people's entertainment! Much like blizzard. Or God knows however many other corporations that people use. No one actually cares, it's just easier to be outraged at someone elses actions than take their own"
The new Mulan movie is getting world wide boycott after the protagonist has supported the HK Police though.
I thought that was just talking about the Rockets gm there.
"People are fickle too, change their minds according to what's popular. Learned the word baizuo yesterday"
"this post was made during hong kong hours, not USA hours, so what you're seeing is people who live in that part of the world online now, but the other day was probably usa time where people can have a bit less understanding of the nuanced situation.
The internet is now a game to propagandize with bot mentality, check the anti liberal and pro authority facist trumpy stuff during the russian hours (with everyone speaking english LMAO.)
Has nothing to do with what you posted, when and where and what bots are on the case."
"Because reddit only ever agrees with OP, it's part of the circlejerk rules. Then some other well-liked celebrity posts another minor offensive tweet out of the hundreds on their account or say the n word or some shit and we turn on them and threaten to ruin their career spanning decades until they're forced to apologize. It's the law of the internet"
It's not just LeBron either. All of them.
"As a black American who supports Hong Kong, Lebron can go fuck himself.  Before this I actually thought Lebron had morals and principles.  Growing up black in America(Growing up in America really) the quote from the real King(Maritin Luther) was heard often when it comes to human rights ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere"".  Free Hong Kong!!!"
"Lmao, I’m sure the players in the clippers care about Hong Kong. They were so outspoken before right?"
Im sure this will upset him greatly.
Can you inform me on Beyoncé’s hypocrisy?  Legit curious/ignorant.
When did Reddit start collectively hating LeBron? The guy has done a ton of philanthropy and constantly speaks out against social injustices but everyone thinks he’s a bad guy because of some comments he made about a situation he has almost nothing to do with.
">his own ethnicity

So does that means as an Asian, I don't have to give a fuck about blm? Good, fuck blm."
"It’s not so much that he isn’t going around advocating for the rights of HKers in his free time, it’s that he went out of his way to criticize Daryl Morey for an objectively good tweet and called him uneducated and uninformed. It’s about as hypocritical as it gets."
"He has also donated millions to charities like Boys and Girls Club of America,  Children’s Defense Fund, and ONEXONE. He raised even more for charities by using his stardom. However, being a superstar with a platform that he has he is held to a higher standard and should be, but he still is human and humans make mistakes. To assume someone won't is just as hypocritical 

Now was the tweet wrong? Yes most definitely.

However I think the guy has done enough good in his life that he at least deserves the opportunity to become more educated on the situation himself and for people not to rush condemning him for being evil, or completely self interested."
"The point is he only cares about black people. He doesn't care if people with a different color skin are being repressed. In fact hes all for it if it makes him money. Thats why he criticized morey for being ""uneducated"" when he spoke out against the injustices happening in HK. If lebron just stayed silent none of this would be happening. But he specifically set up a pro-China rhetoric."
"But why actively stand against those that do give a shit? No one expects him to save the world,... he’s a ball player after all. But to come out against those who are trying to do something about injustice ,... especially because of $$?! What a sellout."
"It's called hypocrisy. He does care about social change, only when it doesn't affect his bottom line. This only became so apparent during his reaction to the Hong Kong protests."
"Yes, he gives a shit about the HK situation.

He's actively pro-China"
Thank you. This is the response I was looking for. He even tried to clarify his comments afterward about the situation but I bet nobody bothered to look that far into the situation.
"He only paid for 25% of the Promise School. The rest is falling on taxpayers in an already broke city. It's a complete fraud, and was only done for the public image of Lebron and Politicians."
"I won’t say Lebron didn’t make some missteps but I expect people to be more concerned about what’s happening in their country than elsewhere. As an Asian that supports BLM and HK, I don’t blame NBA players for speaking up about their country and not elsewhere. Heck as an MLB fan I know they’re trying to tap into the Chinese market and I don’t see the people criticizing Lebron demand the MLB boycott China. I think Lebron should have worded the criticism better but Daryl Morey deleted his tweet and didn’t even stand by what he was saying. Yet I don’t see people criticizing Morey for bowing down to pressure."
"Thank you man, we have our own issues here but all of a sudden it’s Lebrons responsibility for some shit in Hong Kong? Get the fuck outta here with this bullshit."
The NBA needs to stop doing stuff in China as a whole.
"He should also call out Nike for their sweatshops, but sadly he won’t because he only cares about himself and his money."
"Rich people are greed robots, heard."
Quick! Someone call Ja Rule cause we need to hear his voice on this so we can make sense of it all.
Similar to the Drew Brees debacle. Say one stupid thing and all of the sudden all of the incredible work you’ve done is disregarded. Although at least brees has taken the criticism with grace. Lebron just kinda did nothing
"A lot can change in 27 years. Every step taken helps, especially when the step is taken by somebody like Lebron, and especially when lebron not taking that step shows such clear hypocrisy and greed"
He doesn't owe HongKongers anything. No one does
"Damn, I'm sure you two know each other well."
"> This argument would apply to all the rioters and protesters in America. They’re all hypocrites then not just Lebron.

Why? Did they publically try to discredit someone who spoke out against Chinese treatment of Hong Kong protestors, because it hurt their bank account?

You're all over this thread fyi.

Trying to what?
I don’t know why this would surprise anybody. The nation has Been unofficially declaring that the purpose of life is profits above all else for as long as I can remember.
1. capitalism dosent care about morals only shareholder profit 2. every company big enough does business with china its the largest market in the world.
USA has clear moral problems too.  Should they get out of USA now?

BLM is in his personal best interests.
Ya well then dont go around saying that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere and people wouldn't be calling him a hypocrite as much. Pretty simple really
I mean that basically excuses anyone who is shitty overall but has some philanthropic works.
Great post
"Ehn... Is not that complicated.

He is at least aware that there are issues, but made a choice not to educate himself or care about it.

Why? Because he and his employer are financially involved in the situation. And/or is a lot of work. 

He is basically Drew Breesing the situation.

Yeah, he does a lot for his community, but then ignores issues and calls people out because it doesn't affect him and, what he perceives as, his people."
Thank you. I think it’s also important to note that Lebron would take a more active approach to the issues facing the black community in America seeing as how he and his family and friends are part of it and understands the improvements that need to be made so the future can be more successful.  His philanthropy is exemplary and very important.
I don’t follow basketball at all. What’s his position on Hong Kong?

"Why is ""freedom of speech"" being used for unconstructive dumb fucking shit instead of the things we need it for, to criticize someone by actually providing a coherent argument without the fear of being put to jail because you're on the wrong side"
"Freedom of speech is there so we can speak up when there are powers like the CCP that trample on basic human rights.

If there are ""consequences"" because you're criticizing those powers, then you're using freedom of speech the right way."
What a POS...
Wow. Where did he say this?
Asians lives matter? Except sweat shop workers
"The problem is his hypocrisy, not his lack of taking a hard stance. He lectures people about human rights when it’s BLM but does the opposite with HK. 

It’s fine for him not to speak up to HK but don’t go right around lecturing white people about BLM then. They have no reason to care just like Lebron right? It doesn’t affect them"
It's worse... Read his old comments on kneeling.
"Well screw that.

He aint supporting HK (and is pro-China in this sense) anyway. That HK debacle just soured LeBron in my eyes. And this BLM stuff made it more so."
"But why? If hes going to be a cunt about it, dont care. Hes a cunt anyway."
"Exactly, and I expect Lebron James to not be representative of all (black) people. Lebron James represents Lebron James."
“Injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere “ MLK. Lebron is hypocrite
"Spitting facts bro. 

My most charitable view of all this criticism of Lebron is that white people have the privilege of viewing the plight of Hong Kong and the plight of Black folks under the same vein: as spectators. It’s very difficult for them to understand why BLM and Hong Kong are fundamentally different to a man of Lebron’s skin color. One is life and death, and the other he is spectating like them. They can’t (or won’t) see the difference."
"I’d gild you if it was free. Very well said and it just infuriates me how much of a hypocritical mob mentality forum this place can be. LeBron speaks wrongly one time, on a subject he obviously wasn’t educated on, when put on the spot by a reporter and is instantly a massive anti-HK douchebag? I just don’t get how people expect him to be Mother Teresa and the best basketball player in the world at the same time."
They just want a chance to shit on Lebron.
"Reddit isn’t a group of people. It’s a location where many different groups of people show up. The majority opinion of reddit can change by the hour due to the presence of different groups.

Lebron is not a group of people. He actually is responsible for being a selfish asshole despite your misunderstanding of what Reddit is."
"LeBron is a multimillionaire and one of the most famous humans that have ever existed honestly, And he still had racist slag spray painted on his house.. also who here mentioned you oppressing anyone like I’m lost as hell"
do you know what racism is
Get back to principles? I can’t think of a time when politics in America weren’t about identity
"What a meaningless statement. 


All gains for marginalized groups have occured **because of identity politics**

And you forget that  *all politics are identity politics.* Just for white people ""identity politics"" means *those people's* politics."
"Sure. So what principles do the American right have, exactly? ""Blah blah bootstraps, personal responsibility blah blah status quo is fine, very fine people on both sides?"""
"I just learned a new term.  I agree with you on this one after looking up what it is.  I have complained about it myself without knowing there was a term for it.

It seems like a lot of people spend a fair amount of time on calling out what makes of different.  Instead it would be nice to hear what we ALL should strive for.

I also think the left needs to back off on gun grabbing some.  That is a good way to instantly turn off some voters.  Especially after what the country has experienced the last few months."
You're just going to ignore all the people who denounced Trump calling the virus the Chinese virus and the increase of hate crimes that followed? I think it's very misleading to say BLM didn't care about racism against Asian Americans.
The black community does regularly discuss black on black violence. Do you think they just sit back while gang members terrorize their streets?
"Think of all the companies that are going full on Pride Month, but for their branches in the Middle East and other more ‘conservative’ areas, nothing going on at all. (Looking at you Bethesda)

Think of all the companies clamping down hard on anti-CCP posts, yet are vocal about BLM. They are only in it for the money."
That's how all rich people are man. Humanity is enslaved by money
"Morals to LeBron seems to only relevant when it fits a personal financial cause. Or perhaps he only ""cares"" about the state of affairs in the US.

Either way, it comes across as very hypocritical. You either criticize the movement in HK and the US due to its premises and vandalism, or you support both. Any other stance highlights double standards."
"""So that makes him seem like a real....bitch"" 

Made me think of Mac, just imagined him slapping a bitch tag on his poster board of LeBron."
"Do you ever see or hear of MLK making that statement or any speech about a country other than the USA? Because if he didn’t, then you should call MLK a bitch too with your reasoning."
Yeah people love to shit on LeBron but if me tweeting about China would lower my salary by even 5% I wouldn't say shit.
Right and then everyone promptly decided to ignore it as soon as he did another sweet dunk.
"All of my friends here just don't get it. ""he built a freaking school dude...he's a great person"" and that's the end of it."
"That's not really an accurate narrative of what's happened though. It would be one thing if he stayed silent on the issue or said he didn't know enough to comment or take a stance. But he called another player criticizing China's treatment of Hong Kong ""misinformed"" and ""uneducated"". That's taking a pretty clear stance on the issue

He also brands himself as a social justice advocate, profits off that with his branding/advertisements, and makes statements like ""injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere"" (quoting mlk). He put himself in that role. Why shouldn't people check him on his hypocrisy? Would LeBron be okay with other international figures taking similar stances on BLM?"
"The problem is his hypocrisy, not his lack of taking a hard stance. He lectures people about human rights when it’s BLM but does the opposite with HK. 

Idk why tf you brought in fracking because both of these issues are human rights and police brutality. It’s fine for him not to speak up to HK but don’t go right around lecturing white people about BLM then. 

They have no reason to care just like Lebron right? It doesn’t affect them"
"I mean hong kongers are facing virtually the same problem, police brutality."
And I learned it today! Thanks
Yes that's very smart. Cite a Chinese word to make fun of westerners who point out that Chinese government is garbage.
"That's a solid, and scary, explanation"
Well thank you for explaining these rules.  Much appreciated
saying nothing is better than tweeting out exactly what the Chinese Govt. would say.
I think they're referring to the fact that products with her name on them are made in sweatshops.
There is none. Saying you dislike Beyoncé just gets reddit hard.
"This is just turning into one of Reddit’s classic racist-lite “shit on a bunch of highly successful people who *just so happen* to be black, for minor flaws they’d excuse/completely ignore from a white celebrity” sub-threads."
The reason this specifically makes me dislike him is because  It's not like he said this isn't my fight or  He declined to comment.  He told and another person in his industry to basically shut up and dribble and called them uneducated for simply saying the words free Hong-Kong.  He acted towards Daryl morey the exact same way that Fox News acts towards LeBron himself.  Lebron was not just protecting himself.  He was protecting the Chinese government and the atrocities they are committing to civilians.
"Literally the HK stuff there was a post here on how Lebron and other black athletes made a group to help stop voter suppression and all the comments were ""WHAT ABOUT CHINA????????LEMAO JAMES, SHUT UP AND DRIBBLE"""
"LeBron has always had haters, so it's unsurprising 
seeing him get attacked so harshly for his gaff. 

Redditors also like to invalidate the opinion of Black Athletes who protest the treatment of Black people in the US. Just look at all the shit Kyrie is getting now for simply performing his role as a player rep, or how people discredited Kap for kneeling when he didn't vote. If you speak out, you have to literally be perfect according to Reddit. 

it's clear what's really going on if you pick up on the vibes but those types of comments will get downvoted"
"Because Reddit has this massive hate boner for China, and they believe that everybody should constantly be speaking out against them, even though that’s a job for the State Department.

Simple fact of the matter is, that Moray guy made a dumbass tweet (that he deleted a couple days later btw) while a bunch of players were in China, a country notorious for being pissy over the smallest things. LeBron got asked, and dude just gave his opinion on the tweet and stuff."
"Reddit doesn't like BLM, so anything they can do to discredit people involved with it they will. ""What about HK"" is just playing gotcha."
Because on reddit if you’re not an activist for every cause then you’re not a real activist at all. It’s dumb.
He criticized morey for putting the nba family in danger.  He didnt give a fuck about the subject of morey's intitial retweet.  He was just pissed that his team and the nets were the ones actually in china when morey decided to retweet the picture.  If morey did that while the rockets were in china i dont think lebron would have gone so hard at morey.  People keep forgetting that important context when discussing this situation.  Lebrons comments were strictly anti-morey and pro-nba.  They werent anti-hong kong or pro-china at all.
"To say Lebron only cares about Black people is a huge logical leap. You could say he doesn't care about the people in of HK, that he's pro-China. Sure. But no, you've gone ahead and made a much deeper evaluation off of one quote where he called Morey uneducated for making an anti-China tweet despite it being one of the NBA’s biggest markets."
"There are more nba fans in China than there are people in the US. 

Not a. Excuse just an explanation."
"Should the NBA stop doing stuff in the US as a whole? The US imprisons a higher percent of our population than any other country in the world, has security forces murdering ethnic minorities in the street, has capital punishment, imprisons both journalists and protestors, and continues genocide against indigenous populations if they ever stand up and speak out against oil pipelines."
"But apparently he owes China something, as he took Morey's tweet personally and proceeded to show how much the Chinese have him by the pursestrings.

 Does that sit well with you?"
"People were so sure they knew Drew Brees was complete pond-scum when he didn't agree with the agenda of their protests. They were ready to force him into retirement and send death threats to his family. 

When LeBron doesn't support certain protests the reaction is nowhere near the same. 

Fuck tribalistic double standards."
"A big portion of his success is genetic, LeBron would be on reddit too if he was 5 10"
to business.
They were talking about setting up a minor/farm league in China.
It's whole existence.
Capitalism can exist in more forms than the current one. The one we have now is pretty screwed up.
"No, they should triple down and get into the North Korean market."
It’s hippo critical that Lebron doesn’t speak out against China’s human rights abuses but does so against the US’s suggesting he cares about the big market in China in comparison to the smaller market in the US.
RIP Capital Steez
After the latest season of Ozark I've seen this song referenced a lot more
Ya because then it would be CFEAM lmao definitely doesn’t make sense lol
"And if I recall correctly, he was telling other players to shut up about it too.  That’s a lot worse than just staying silent."
"You’re not wrong at all. This is an issue where Lebron clearly put his financial interests above human rights. And what’s worse is it’s not even as if he didn’t comment on the issue, he openly condemned Daryl Morey’s statements. 

I’m just pointing out that it’s unfair to say Lebron always puts his financial interests above the common good. This is a man who has done more philanthropy work than probably everyone commenting here on reddit. And while it’s easy to condemn a public figure, I don’t exactly think all these keyboard warriors on reddit are actively protesting Hong Kong, working in soup kitchens, or otherwise always doing their part in making the world a better place. I’m merely saying that you can’t judge a person based off a single action of theirs - you have to weigh their actions in totality. And while this doesn’t help Lebron, we’re also talking about a guy who got crazy rich and famous at a very young age and in this modern day has managed to have almost no issues about him - no secret affairs, no drug issues, family man, and someone who does donate a huge amount of time and money to causes important to him."
"well yea.  its not his fight.  he fights primarily for black people.  that's how it is for minority races, they usually look out for their own first and formost.  We saw how Lin kept getting the boot in the NBA, and shaq making fun of Yao with everyone was cool with it.  oddly enough white activist usually the ones that fight for everyone.

LeBron woulda been next level if he defended HK, but he's not next level.  Just typical.

Edit: Another way to say it.  If he spoke up, the NBA would lose money, he would lose money, and a lot of basketball players (who are predominately black) would lose money, to a cause a lot they dont care about.  I mean hell, what have they done for Africa?  They're letting bill gates fight the fight there lol."
"His image is a part of his revenue stream. If it’s damaged he doesn’t make as much. Plus the tax deductible donations. These foundations etc are an image laundering operation for the wealthy. However, there’s more to be made in China than lost capitulating to it."
"Mighty big claims there, fella."
But his response was a bunch of words held together by projection.
"So, I disagree (vehemently) with LeBron on this issue.  That said, one of the things people forget is that there were NBA players physically in China when Morey tweeted this, and others (including LeBron) on their way there.  If you listen to The Lowe Post or The Hoop Collective, some of those guys were interviewed when they came back to the US and they did say that it was a huge deal over there, to the point where they felt (rightly or not) that if they said the wrong thing at a postgame press conference or in an interview that they could end up in jail.  I think LeBron’s motivations are probably mostly financial, and the NBA’s response as a whole has been extremely disappointing.  However, LeBron does have a point that Morey’s tweet probably created an unnecessary risk for the players that were over there."
"Hey now...that tweet hurt people physically, emotionally and spiritually! But most importantly it hurt him financially...it's just hard for non-millionaires like us to understand."
"He's not a POS, he just was ignorant and short-sighted on this matter. The dude actually does a lot of good for the world and his community. He made a mistake by talking out of his element, but he only said anything because a reporter asked his opinion on it.

People fuck up sometimes, and everyone wants to jump on them and paint them as unequivocally bad. It's not so black and white."
Source? I looked it up and it’s all in support of Kaepernick going back to early 2019.

"I’ve never heard this, do you happen to have the link?"
"Yeah, where TF did that come from?"
I'm joking.  I'm just making fun of his statements on Daryl Morey's support of the HK movement.
"Yeah, exactly, and he represents himself as an hypocrite"
"Given the outrage, you’d think LeBron had said, “I LOVE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT! FUCK THE HONG KONG PROTESTORS! LMAO!”"
"Hijacking thread to remind people Mother Teresa was a monster, who withheld medication from people under her care while getting easy access to it herself when she was sick, because she believed suffering brought her patients closer to god."

BLM has many Asian supporters and vice versa. Check the crowds, not some random Redditors words."
Oil company with a certain ocean logo used/is real bad at this.  Full afternoon all hands meetings telling us about how much thy love and need diversity and they support it globally.  And internal questionnaires having like 10 options to identity orientation and such.  Then some asshole would say something along the lines of “really proud of us but how’s the Russian arm doing today?” The air would be sucked out of the room.  I loved it or when people would point out the female geologists/geophysics/geoengineers would have to take a “admin. Assistant” job role when going to consult in the Middle East.  The corporation made loud noise whenever it could benefit them and then real quiet on the issue anywhere it would have actually made a difference
"You do know in Middle East they have public floggings, can behead you and if someone threw you off a building for being gay that person won't be punished? You want Bethesda or any other company to put their employees in danger for symbolism?"
"I mean, as a HKer, I wouldn’t have GAF if he held his peace over us and now speaks out about BLM. He’s American and he’s black; of course it makes sense that he’d care more about stuff immediately affecting him and his identity, than about stuff happening half the globe away. That’s no hypocrisy, nor is that double standard. It’s just myopia, which we’re all guilty of, more or less. 

But instead of shutting his trap about something that wouldn’t have concerned him otherwise per se, he actively chose to put Morey down for his opinions on HK, and pretending now to care about morals and values. That’s where the hypocrisy lies."
"He ""cared"" enough about what is going on in HK enough to undermine the support being given to those affected."
He also may be viewing national controversy pulling against his morality more due to a perceived closeness to the market.
"As someone from Akron, many of us are disappointed."
"Anyone who has been following Hong Kong has been talking about this for months. It isn't new, he is just downplaying it"
Ok and the end result? The guy who tweeted out gets flak while the person who was quiet still makes money from China without getting flak
"They said from a device made in a sweatshop.

I get that Lebron's stance is special in that he vocally defended China, but if we start discrediting every activist because they live under a capitalist system in which ethical consumption doesn't exist, then we no longer have activists. 

This is the same shit they have done to every activist ever. Try to find some reason to discredit them."
"Beyoncé, as a word, gets me hard"
"Hmm...interesting.  The LeBron problem is legitimate, I think.  If he had just not tweeted out a critique of Morey, no one would have batted an eye except those who really pay attention.  But because he did, he opened himself up to an obvious hypocritical stance.

There are plenty of black celebrity/sports activists who don't seem as hypocritical.  The problem is that none of them have the platform he has.

&#x200B;

Attacking Beyonce without a specific action to attack her on feels empty and potentially ""racist-lite"" as you call it."
Ding ding ding.
If you're going to be a black activist you have to walk on water or a huge amount of white people are going to hate you.  It's either that or die a martyr.
"Thank you for bringing up Kyrie, him and Dwight don’t want to play because they don’t feel it’s right and people are shitting on them because a lot of money could be lost, and then the same people shit on lebron for wanting to protect his money"

You are making absolutely Moronic false equivalency comparisons. And I feel convinced you are a sino troll... so blocked."

The entire league took issue with Morey's tweet. Its going to be even more apparent when Fertitta fires him from the Rockets, next season."

"You do not remember correctly.  The correct context that no one wants to talk about is that lebron and his team were literally mid-air on the way to china to play in pre-season games against the brooklyn nets.  While in the air,  daryl morey, the houston rockets gm (who is china's number 1 favorite/popular team by far) retweeted a picture expressing support for hong kong protestors.  This caused china to react forecfully and in threatening ways and halted all plans for the lakers and nets once they landed.  They cancelled all activities and practices.  They cancelled the charity nba cares events planned for the kids in china.  They also cancelled a g league showcase which was scheduled in china and helped support the minor league players in the nba that make less than 100k a year.  This was at the height of the hong kong protests where the world was learning about china rounding up journalists and peaceful protestors and sending them on mysterious train rides out of the country.  China immediatedly scrubbed the nba out of public record and has continued to this day to scrub the rockets out of any nba coverage.  It is as if the team doesnt exist over there now after being the number 1 franchise there since the mid-2000s when yao ming was their star player.  Speaking of yao, he is now head of the chinese basketball assosciation (number 1 domestic league in china) and he immediately disavowed morey's tweet and cut ties with the rockets.  The rockets owner, tilman fertitta, strongly disavowed morey's tweet as well and made sure to say that morey does NOT speak for the rockets.  The next day, the nba itself called morey's tweet ""regrettable"".   This is all happening while lebron and his entire team and the nets entire team and staff and some family members were IN CHINA.  For the next entire WEEK, the lakers and nets were stranded in uncertainty where noone knew what was going to happen as tensions escalated between both countries.  A cnn reporter was shut down from asking rockets players about china.  Blizzard banned a video game player that supported hong kong.  All chinese companies with nba ties cut those ties.  South park made an episode that said fuck china and released it.  This all happened while lebron and his team were stuck in china and expected to play in front of chinese fans.  When the games did actually happen, the fans in the stands where given chinese flags to wave during the game and the teams werent allowed to practice in other facilities leasing up to the game as originally planned.  On october 14th (morey's tweet was october 4th, so 10 full days later),  lebron was finally back on american soil ssfely with his team and was asked constantly about the china situation and he could finally release his anger towards morey.  ****It was not anti-hong kong.  It was not pro-china.  His comments were strictly and emotionally anti-morey and pro-nba.**** That is the part people keep getting twisted and run with.  He was so pissed at the situation morey put his entire team and the nets, members of the nba family in.  And he spoke out in ways that didnt address the actual situation about protestors and hong kongs freedom like everyone was expecting.  He did it in his famous passive aggressive subtweet language.  When he called morey ""uneducated"" thats p.c. for ""fuckin dumbass"".  For the record, daryl morey has still to this day yet to continue his support for hong kong.  He actually damaged the movement in hong kong by allowing china to flex its muscles the way it did on the global stage morey provided and no country actually stood up to china and made them calm down.  Instead of people directing their anger and passion at world leaders, we took it out on lebron.  Its absurd.  Absolutely absurd and even more so that its continuing to this day as a way to discredit all the good that Lebron does for issues that he has the power to help with in his own home.

"Morey never made a statement supporting hong kong.  He simply retweeted an image about standing with hong kong.  Since the incident, he has yet to continue his support for hong kong in any way and refuses to speak on the subject."
"I'm not a fella, but that's alright.  I did have firsthand experience, so there ya go."
Ngl I wasn't really making the statement about this specific situation only. I just see this a lot and it's stupid as fuck.
I belly laughed at this. Thank you
"Then they easily could have gone back on their statements once they returned and there was no imminent danger.  But they didn’t, so that’s bullshit.  Like you said - it was a financial decision for him and he made his choice, later he attempted to (weakly) backtrack."
Maybe the NBA shouldn’t be putting it’s personnel inside a country that they’re afraid will arrest them simply for exercising their freedom of speech.
"I get your point, but how likely is it for China to jail a well-known figure such as an NBA player? Not much I imagine."
"It’s 100% financial, rightly or not. China is a despicable regime that oversees a huge market. If the NBA had a moral spine, it would ignore China as a market. But that has big implications for players, employees, the entire NBA. There’s no easy answer for China. Lebron should’ve just stfu about China instead of vomiting that verbal garbage."
">non-millionaires


That fucker is closing in on a billion and he's like 36 or something, He a signed a lifetime contract with a Nike a couple years ago that's reportedly worth a billion itself."
He still is unless he made a statement walking back those comments.
"So to you, his local philanthropy outweighs his significant opinion about Hong Kong's rights. He has a platform, and he has a bad take. Because money.

This, although obviously not as egregious, sounds like that slave-trader whose statue was brought down. He had his philanthropy and was loved for that. But he got that money by the subjugation of other people. He seems all too ok with getting that money via Chinese sources with his support of the Chinese government, but he then takes that money and does local good. Different variables given different times, but I can see how for a Hong Konger it might not feel so different. James is willing to serve Hong Kong up for that good, good money."
"Oh I must have missed where he apologized to Morey and retracted his statements? /s

Why would anyome just magically believe this? How much of a mistake can he think it is without an apology or even acknowledging it at all? You can justify it for him and say he's didn't mean it, but until he acknowledges the issue himself, people are gonna believe what he said are still his beliefs on the matter"
Im guessing you wont be getting that link
"There isn't a link. LeBron hasn't said anything against kneeling.

"Right wingers don't care about hong kong, they're just anti anything left"
"There are two groups that criticize LeBron. 

1. Those bothered by his comments about Morey related to HK. They are bothered by the lack of consistency and want him to at least speak on both. 

2. Those who use his comments on HK to discredit BLM and it's supporters. They don't actually care about HK, and actually just want him to shut up about both. 

Fox News constantly parrots the second one."
"You don't get it, do you?

It's the hypocrisy of acting ""ethical"" in the western world, while at the same time continuing to do business in cultures that would imprison you for daring to express the same opinion within their borders. It's not about putting their employees in danger, they shouldn't even be operating in these countries in the first place if they genuinely gave a damn!

But they all do it, because money talks louder than human rights to them. Yet people still lap it up."
"I’m not sure how big this company is, or how important it is for the Middle East to keep them there, but these companies sometimes have leverage that others don’t. They should use that leverage to push for more human rights if at all possible, imo."

Lebron has never tweeted about morey.  Please get the facts straight if we are going to try to tear down philanthropists characters.  Lebron made unscripted comments in a press circle after returning home from china during the entire morey/south park-china/blizzard shitstorm.  It was an international incident by that time.  He was pissed at morey for putting moreys own nba family at risk.
LeBron James is just three Isaiah Thomas' stacked on top of each other in a Lakers' jersey.

You know what's funny about capitalism? It takes two actors to make a transaction. We bitch and moan about how capitalism is screwing us and then we run to whatever corporate entity offers the lowest price. The next time you shop at a big retail chain or watch the nba just remember you are a small part of the problem. Change the system with your wallet.

"take lebrons dick out of your mouth for a second and try to rationally analyse the situation

A number of players stayed silent or took neutral stances, which would have been fine for lebron to do. I would not have blamed him one bit had this been the case because everyone attached to lebron and the nba would have suffered financially. But what lebron did was come out and attack the person who was supporting the Hong Kong protestors, with that rambling nonsense of a response he came up with.

A player who boasts ""Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything."" and then actively criticises someone speaking out against human rights issues is a fucking hypocrite plain and simple."
Man I’ve been trying to explain this to people since this all happened. They do not care. It’s way easier to say LeBron is bad. The simple fact that Morey walked back his tweet and had to release a statement against it is quite literally the proof in the pudding that his statement wasn’t well-thought out.
"I hear you, but this still proves Lebron only cares about money and image because he’s more pissed at the situation Morey put players in than China committing human rights violations against a whole country of people. Lebron could have called China out and backed his teammate up when they got back in the states, but instead he made China look stronger by publicly shaming his teammate in front of the world.

Yep, Lebron is a double-douche."
Ahh I feel you. Yea I was let down hard by the NBA and LeBron's responses.
They didn't because they were fucking pissed. If your boss sent you to China then pissed off the CCP and Chinese citizens would you get back here and he preaching about human rights or the fact that your boss is a fucking idiot that could've got you detained in China for some shit he didn't even stand behind.
"Again, I agree that there is pretty clearly a financial motivation.  But that doesn't mean that's the \*only\* motivation.  It can be both."
They literally jailed 3 UCLA players 2 years ago for shoplifting.
"He partly did. He admitted he wasn't in the best position to comment on the situation shortly afterward. That's not the same as vocally reversing his position, but he withdrew himself from the conversation and acknowledged his ignorance."
"Given one involves him doing a lot of good things and the other is an admittedly bad take from someone who has no power to change that situation, I'd say yes."
"Yes. His philanthropy is real action with real impact. His take on China is bad, but it's just words from a guy who is not really involved with business or diplomatic relations with China or HK. And he did partially walk it back shortly after by admitting that he wasn't educated enough on the whole situation to comment."
"> They should use that leverage to push for more human rights if at all possible, imo.

Yes they can, one of the ways it can be done is through exposing the people to outside views (Bethesda is a video game company, they make/publish Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Dishonored etc.) and slowly generating change among the younger people. ..... I dont think risking the employees backs and heads would bring change. I will remind you that KSA government butchered a journalist to pieces in another country and there was no 'justice' for it.

"People have to look for the cheapest option because they don't have a lot of money, which was brought on by the companies refusing to pay people a proper wage. It was designed this way. Voting with your wallet only works if you have money, and even better if you have tons of it. A millionaire can out vote probably a million other people.

These are comforts.

Comment
"Worth noting this is almost certainly just the demo-team running the 2018 car for the test Renault are doing.

They confirmed this separate demo-team (as opposed to the race-team) are running the car for that test [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RenaultF1Team/status/1271460644127150080?s=20)

>...we have a team that operates the R.S.18 for demo runs - they are going, while the race team will head to Austria later, for the GP."
First pole is for Renault.
The first one to Austria gets Dinoco...
Renault will be using the filming days for testing like the other teams and they choose to do it in Austria. They're not there for the GP

I hope they remembered to also bring the 2020 car and not just the 2018 one... \#justrenaultthings
Never left 16 years old. Complete waste of resources.
This guy researches.
Demo as in show off? How does a team get valuable data from an old car running on a tried and tested track?
Any idea who the drivers are for that?
Also have they ever been 1st?

"From what I read, the issue wasn't blatant unwillingness, but that Renault couldn't fly it's engineers out to run the power units at tests thanks to travel restrictions."
Pls Toto if this happens and Bottas goes to Renault
"Lmao, the Renault bashing goes on even when it doesn’t make sense"
Why would they bring the 2020 car so early?
That's Peke for you
"Well it’s their demonstration team. Renault is one of those teams that do attend and run some promotional demonstration events using previous cars, and so they employ a team to run and maintain those cars.

This test seems purely to give the drivers some track time after such a long time off. It’s not really for data or even for practising new social-distancing protocols because the race-team aren’t even there.

So yeah, it’s pretty much just for the drivers to get their eye in."
This operation is not about testing the car and more about getting some practice for on-track operations for race-day.
The FIA has allowed testing with cars no younger than two years old under these circumstances to give the drivers tracktime. Mercedes did it in Silverstone last week and I think Ferrari did this aswell.
"[this video](https://youtu.be/au4MG_Fvr9A) will answer your questions, essentially they’re likely testing the capabilities and components of keeping socially distanced with the looming threat of covid."
"They announced on their Instagram recently that Ocon and Ricciardo would be each doing one day of testing in the 2018 car. Can't remember the exact details, but it should be available on their social media somewhere"
"Well, he was with Renault for a bit."
It sucks that I'll never get to see the Pole on pole. Just imagine where Kubica's career would've been without the injury
"Okay, I thought I read somewhere that it would be filming days. Or maybe that was for racing point"

"Why wouldn't Red Bull hold that power? They don't just pay a yearly fee to slap their name on the track like i.e. Etihad do with the Manchester City football stadium, they outright own the race track. They can rent the place out or turn people down all they want."
yEs
"Its also like Red Bull does then? sometimes uses the old RBs with Coulthard as the driver etc, just to show them off?"
Didn't Mercedes do this in Silverstone a few days back to figure out social distancing as a team (in addition to giving their drivers some track time)?
Alpha Tauri are filming at Imola
"They’re just using up their leftover filming day allowance and using it as testing. Same thing Mercedes did, which is why there’s heaps of footage of that test."
Does anyone know if HAAS is going to test in america
OW THAT HURT
YOU WERE TOO CLOSE TOGETHER. CONTRACTED COVID. GP CANCELLED.
what?.... what’s happening?
They would probably end up losing the ability to host a GP if they started doing that.
Yes. They do demo runs so fans can see the cars up close. They will sometimes close off city streets and thousands of people will show up to be able to check out an F1 car in person. Not everyone has the chance to got to an F1 race.
Yup
Racing Point will be at Silverstone
Filming day applies to in-years cars. For older cars the restrictions are less. Mercedes have been using their 2018 cars which although still covered by the FIA testing rules it is still less so
"Doubt, if they test it most likely will be in Europe"
YEAH HE'S OKAY MOMMM
"If they outright told Renault to piss off, maybe, but Red Bull could always say the track is unavailable due to preparations for the GP."
[They did this in Vienna a few years back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UafC59_KIG8) - the sound is deafening and you could hear it all over the city...

"IM SURE THAT GUY IS OK, I WONDER WHO HE WAS"

I do not get it. Why john Cena?
But if he does all his s own stunts then why is John Cena in the photo?
Fun fact: Jackie Chan sometimes uses a double when he can't pull the stunt aesthetically appealing enough to satisfy him.
But who's John Cenas stunt double?
No it’s drax
Nah it's Drax
what's the meme with John Cena? xD

That's no way to treat a current employee!"
I loath political sycophants who manipulate shit to work against someone intentionally (like scheduling an interview when they know you're unavailable).That really boils my blood. I hope you enjoy every bit of that reimbursement!
They probably already selected a candidate for the job (or just didn't like you).  At my place a person was going to retire and every month or so he reminded management to get his replacement while he was here so there would be some overlap but they didn't to so.  (He had a unique function and the guy who handled his job on a part-time basis had left).  So this person finally retires.  After a few months they finally post the job announcement.  It was on a Friday and it closed on Tuesday (Monday was the 4 of July holiday) so no one really had time to apply (many had left on vacation for a 4 day weekend).  Think they had someone in mind for the position?  There were many complaints as the position was popular due to some internal issues which made the other jobs less desirable.  They did extend the deadline by a couple of days due to the fuss.
"Good, glad they had to pay in the end. Asshats"
I hope you learned the value they place on you.
Sounds like they already had picked someone and were offering interviews as a formality. Sure bit them in the ass. Haha
"TIl the UK also has a freedom of information act. Ours was passed under lbj probably around 1965. State public records act (""sunshine law"") came later."

"In Germany, we had sex ed in biology and in religion. Our catholic teacher, who was a priest, taught contraception in religion class, including the famous condom on banana.

How different people can be. I've lost count of how many times I""ve had this exact argument with bosses..."
Sounds like they had someone they wanted and OP was more qualified.
"Yes, they had definitely already made their minds up but were just advertising the job for legal reasons"
"It is more common then you would think. I work at a major university in the U.S and this type of behavior happens every day in admissions, Human Resources and even by department Heads and Dean Offices."
I would say that they had more than likely already decided that they didn't want to give the OP the job and were doing this to avoid having to tell him so (which might make working together awkward).
"Make sure to keep them privately, maybe printed out at home, or on a USB stick somewhere in a drawer, you wouldn't want anything to vanish from company servers ;)"
I would hope OP is looking for a new job after that stunt!
What's the point? They clearly have their mind made up so it's pointless anyone else applying.
Yet he’s the current payout on Cheerios?
Universities are the worst. They screw the students at every turn and they screw the staff too. They all need much more regulation.
I'm guessing it means an older policy that has been superseded by a new one.
"This happens at my work all the time. I'm a contracted worker in IT Security, and so far I've watched three people get hired in front of me either from within the company (already full time ""real"" employees"") and even one from outside.

I've literally been doing the exact position for over a year, but they're hiring good ol boys and outside hires, probably because they're already hired me through the contract company and are paying me way less, and if they hire me on they have to pay the company a bonus, but still...

It got even better when they recently ""reviewed and revised"" the job requirements to make me ineligible for the full time position I'm currently working on contract. I've literally been doing the job... and now I'm not even qualified to be hired for it. Needless to say, I'm looking at other companies lol"
Never underestimate the lengths people with tiny amounts of power will go to fuck over someone 'below' them.
Yes... external email for sure.
Also take photographs of said emails on your work computer if you can't forwards those emails due to filtering.
You can backup and download all your emails from gmail if your company uses gmail as a host.
You got to make it look like you're still deciding
"Similar happened to me. I think some positions for transparency or some crap need to open it for all and not show favoritism, and end up shining a light on it.

I had applied for a spot, did great, I knew people that worked there and they said the interviewers spoke highly of me. They extended the application time something like 2-3x, NO ONE else applied and then the last extension someone internal applied and got it immediately. I think they were waiting for them to meet the requirements."
"A lot of government jobs have requirements when it comes to posting jobs to ensure it's a fair process. But what do you do when you have an intern who has been amazing and you want to convert to a full time employee? You already know this person is amazing, but the protocols require you to do a whole search? Well in the US what they do is write a job description so specific that the only person who fits all requirements is the intern."
There may be some sort of point system they can't ignore.
Yeah that's exactly what this university is like too. They will write the job description based upon the CV of the person they want to hire. It sucks man -you deserve better.
"Similar in my position (I am working at a helpdesk lvl 1 support for production, but I'm working for a company providing the service), I am basically doing the same work as the others. They are hired as ""system engineers"" or ""system architects"" (depending on previous experience), so they don't have to pay me the exact same amount of money due to me being hired as an ""on site field supporter"".    
I am doing the exact same work - or was, to be exact.      

During my time they filled two positions in my team that opened up: The first one was filled with the son of the teamleader's boss. The guy himself is quite okay, but he has LESS experience than me and gets paid about 50% more? Well... that's when I started reading what my job description REALLY entails.       
Then the second position opened up and they hired an external guy that seems doing this exact same job already for one and a half years... The new guy was well versed in a very specific field that does not pertain to the current work need, but seemingly this qualifies for him being paid at least a third more than I am (but probably also 50% more. Would be strange otherwise).       

Needless to say: when I was asked to show him the ropes, I declined. My job description isn't saying anything about this.        
I am not writing any form of code or scripts anymore. Anything above VERY BASIC troubleshooting is a ""I don't know how to do this"" from me - and this can cost the company a lot of production time. Didn't happen yet, but it will. And as I am never allowed to work alone (I have to have a ""qualified IT person"" working with me in the same shift at all times) they have to know how to do it. Because I don't - I'm not paid for it. And at least two people in my team are not able to fix some of the more exotic problems because they rarely encounter them (due to the shift plan and all, it's not necessarily their fault) - so they will have to phone up (you know, 3rd level and such) even though we could fix that in minutes ourselves. If someone would know how to...     
    
In the last meeting with the bosses (they are about once a year, or when something major happens I assume) they asked what's up and I told them, if they want me to do the same job like all the others, I want to be paid the same too - and until then I will do what my job description (which, btw, is a form of union contract, they can't ""just"" change it) says. And also that me previously doing it was an error on my part because I thought they would then just hire me - me being there, doing a LOT of stuff and learning, ah silly me.     

For now, nothing else happened. I am quite sure I shot any chance that could've been left for a position directly there, but fuck them. They showed they wouldn't have hired me anyway, no loss there.      
The people in my team are good ones, I have to say that, and they are not only on my side but quite supporting (they too see the unfairness there).        
This was six months ago. I assume nothing else will happen until the first expensive problem I am not qualified to fix :D     

Edit: lot's of typos and such...Y'know, english is not my native language."
"Unfortunately, this is where playing office politics comes into play. I was hired with AT&T back in the 90s because I was working for them on a special project as a contractor. I was good, and, among my references, I had a letter of recommendation from the project lead, because I was his go-to guy (actually, the only guy on the team aside from him) Contractually, I had to leave the team at the 6 month mark, which I did, but 2 weeks later, I was hired in a different department (as a direct-hire temp) then when they needed permanent, full time staff, I tested and passed. This was another 4-5 months there, but I spent the next 5 years as a full-time permanent employee.

Talk to your project lead over lunch, and let that person know that you want to become a permanent member of the team. You may discover that the next time an internal position comes available, you're automatically on the short list.

If that doesn't pan out, talk to your employment company and tell them you want a position with another company. When asked why, just tell them where you're at is a dead end."
"I’ve experienced this same exact thing as well! I don’t qualify for higher paying positions, even though the requirements for such are things that I have a lot of experience with, in my current position, and several for my previous jobs. It’s safe for me to say that I have 20 years experience with this skill set. They can’t even offer constructive criticism to allow me to focus on those areas for improvement. I’m okay with that now. I’ve come to the place where I will do the best I can in my position, and not one ounce more."
"Not saying this is you, but as a hiring manager I'll definitely say for every person in your position there's a situation like I just had to deal with. 

I got called into answer a complaint about discriminatory hiring practices because I filled an open position externally instead of with a contractor we had doing the same job. I then provided HR with multiple documents showing where the contractor input results into our lab system with typos or just outright incorrect information. These typos messed up the chain of custody for regulatory samples and could have resulted in fines if another technician didn't catch them. The contractor was repeatedly coached on double checking data entry before saving the sample in our system. Additionally she needed help from other technicians on a daily basis because she was continually falling behind on her workload.

Despite documented coaching and discussions with her on these issues, she seemed to think she was a top performer in the lab and deserved the open position.

Her contract was not renewed."
"FYI, if you’re in the USA, the company is probably paying more for you per hour through the contract house than what their employees make. (That’s true for pay only, not overhead on employees.) Generally, the contractor makes 2/3 of the hourly rate charged by the contract house. The difference is income for the contract house to cover their part in screening candidates, managing billing, handling your taxes, and making sure you get a biweekly paycheck even if they haven’t been paid yet."
"How about working on improving your qualifications? No offense, but there could be actual reasons you are not getting considered. As a manager, people who exceed expectations are never treated this way."
Those same people wonder why their tires are deflated everyday.
"Emailed from the office.  Depending on job, it might be legally required that emails are saved for a period of time.  Fuck em"
"A joke I heard. CEO says to CFO ""good thing you've mentioned your son has a degree in finances, we almost made a requirement that candidates have a degree in law."""
"I don't understand the need for subterfuge. 

If they know who they want to hire why can't they just hire them? Do they not have that right as an employer?"
Honestly they would probably just give you copper blanks
"The best would be if the boss’ son is totally useless and you can get on his shift. If he becomes responsible for the repairs that you actually know how to do, you could really prove a point."
"You’re just a good manager. Many managers do treat people this way for little to no reason. And I think the whole point is- why do pieces of paper saying “I can do this thing” matter if your bosses see you doing that thing every day and know you know how to do it? 

Making people get certifications or degrees to prove something they already know is kinda elitist since not everyone can afford formal education."
lmao
"That varies wildly depending on the country you live in and type of business. You own a corner grocery store and want to hire your child? Go for it. A university that is publicly run would very likely has rules/possibly laws about competitive hiring requirements, and unless the business is actually owned by the people running it there will be others who do not look kindly on you putting incompetent people in place because it will cost them money too."
Not as a UK based university. They receive public funds so all large contracted work has to go to tender and all jobs have to be advertised.
"1) They still have to open it up to other applicants. 

2) Most likely, OP is one of their better workers and while they didn’t want OP for the job, they wanted OP to keep performing at their high level. They probably thought they figured out a way to effectively have OP eliminate him/herself from contention. I’ve seen it before where a company cannot survive without an individual but won’t give them the pay or status to reflect it."
"Legally speaking, no.  Practically speaking, yes.

They must hire for the position filed.  The must make the position filing public.  This is supposed to make the whole process merit based - the employer is supposed to figure out what they need then hire based on that need.  Favoritism is not in the shareholder's interest or in the public's interest.

And yet here we are."
"Most countries have Employment Protections to avoid nepotism locking down upper-level positions in companies. It’s meant to protect Stockholders from incompetence in management. Companies have to treat potential hires the same way the US Government is supposed to treat Contractors budding for a contract, assessing them impartially by a set of objective criteria and their individual qualifications.

Companies get around it by writing the objective criteria to fit the person they want to hire."

"Benjamin Mutton, then."

It’s been 6 months and I already went and got a whole leg of lamb for the spring solstice. Really now I’m just upset I can’t find more mutton because then I’d feel better about it.
Is eating mutton ethical tho?

You can tell how funny Modern Family is going to be by the age of the kids.
"I feel like acting this out irl mom would hit dad with the knife, probably still scare the kids though."
Modern family was the best...
"So, what's that, 3 or 6 months worth of therapy?"
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas.
What show is this?
I miss this show so much.
r/funny is lazy. But damn posting a scene from a comedy show is a whole new kind of lazy.

"I love modern family, it gets less funny in later seasons but it’s still crazy to see everybody all grown up."

Pretty spot on.
You can tell how funny most comedy TV shows are by the age of their cast.

It made me laugh and cry a little."
You did.
Haha! But yes
We'll wish this never ends.
Phil Dunphy is everyone's dad. He's the definition of wholesome.
"Do it!
Fyi pls dont put me in a trap."
Because it's not even good stoner humor. It's just kinda dumb.
Wait I’m having difficulty understanding this sentence.
You have been NEGATIVE UPVOTE
It was funnier in the earlier seasons when the children were young and gets progressively less funny and relatable as the cast age.
"Still applies. While the characters may still be drawn the same age, Marge *sounds* like she's like 90 years old now."
Well now I'm not so sure
"“It looked like they were wrestling, and dad was winning”"
"I miss you, I miss you"
"Phil Dunphy is the cool dad, that's his thing. He’s hip, he surfs the web. He texts. LOL: laugh out loud, OMG: oh my god, WTF: why the face."
"Except the whole thing isn't on any streaming services but Amazon. It may be great, but it's not $20 a season for what, 10 seasons? great. There's just too much Abilene content to dump $200 bucks on a sitcom."
"Ah, okay."
Right? I remember kid Luke seemed like some sort of fucking bizarro comedy genius. Then... well it's better that we don't talk about the lack of hilarity as the kids aged. I'd rather forget.
I think this is usually the case for most sitcoms
Don't waste your time on me!
"And he knows all the dances to high school musical!

He learned from the best though.    
Growing up his dad was the cool dad. He was hip. He knew all the dances from Grease. He knew all the expressions, BFF: best friends forever, TMI: too much Information, BJ: blue jeans."
It was this line here in the first episode that hooked me into the show.
"ABILENE CONTENT LMAO. 
it's on Netflix, in my country at least."
The first 8 at least are on Netflix (at least in Canada); currently on Season 5 at the moment and loving it
First 5 seasons are available on Netflix Japan.  It is awesome.
Both Prime and Netflix have it in the UK
"I don't think it's fair to blame the kids though, just because the writers didn't know what to do with them."
Did a watch-through again (as you do) of the show recently and one of the early season running jokes I throughly enjoyed was Luke’s disapproval and digs at the police.
I thought Married with Children aged like fine wine.
At some point they just start abusing your emotional attachment to the characters and replace the jokes with touching moments and everyone getting married to each other.
"My point was that it gets less relatable as the series progresses. Claire and Phil both become more successful, as do Cam and Mitch, and their lives go away from the “just about managing” demographic."
Lol what are you supposed to be relatable
*toime
"I have NO FUCKING CLUE what my auto correct is up to. It must be tired too.

It's up to season 10 now.  I am also binging it.
"i have the whole 10 seasons (11 coming) on Netflix in Malaysia, it's weird that the US don't have any"
"I’m not sure anyone’s blaming them, just using them as a measure of quality of the show. Like human clocks."
"Ya it’s definitely a show you watch for the actors not the writing.


They tried to make Luke and manny do all that money adventure stuff and it really went boring.


Luke and Phil though: classic team of funny.

My favourites are still cam and Mitchell. But even at times they get a bit stereotypical. I still know they are going to make me giggle,


Lily just gets instantly annoying. And Alex. And for a while there, Claire. But then maybe the writers seem to struggle with writing strong women characters and phone it in
Considering their spectrum just seems to organize women into two main categories : ditzy or annoyingly controlling


But then they seem to write manny, jay and joe as all the same old white man. So ya, you’re right to blame shitty writing for that one."
Their acting got worse except for hailey and Alex
Eh... they threw in the nephew Seven towards the end. That was desperation and turned out pretty bad.

"Took my wife to Cannon Beach last year and as we pull up, we notice it's busier than usual. Cannon Beach is never exactly not busy, but this was really exceptional, zero-parking kind of busy. As we're desperately trying to find somewhere to park, my wife goes, ""Hey, look, two corgis!"" And I go, ""Oh hey, yeah!""

And a second later I realize I'm looking at two corgis out of the driver-side window, and she's looking at two *different* corgis out of the passenger window.

And that's when we realized we had shown up on ""Corgi Day"".

There had to be 200 corgis on the beach that day. Totally unexpected and made a trip to Cannon Beach, always a good time, even better."

"As a resident of Oregon, I love how beautiful it is! I had friends in high school that were always complaining about how boring it was, but I love it! It’s beautiful, and the sound of rain is very soothing!"
You gotta drive the entire coast. Astoria is amazing too.
"
I love Oregon! Currently live in WA but if I had to move you sure bet where I’d go! Go Ducks!"
"Nice pic.  Over-edited, but nice pic."
"Show me the Real Cannon Beach.

*photoshops a Canon camera into picture*

I said the REAL Cannon Beach.

*photoshops pirate ship into picture*

Yar that be perfect.

Happy cake day
"Mine as well. I have some of my earliest childhood memories from here. Such a magical place. 

Beautiful photo"
"When the rainclouds clear, it sure is!"
I used to live a mile away from that beach! It’s beautiful all the time
Do you have a 1920 x 1080 version for wallpapers??
Fuck stop! You're making me want to move back
"Lol wow I was at the monument on Friday and captured the very same dude. Your photo is better than mine, though. https://imgur.com/a/EPFvRFw"
I am so lucky to have grown up there :D
It's pretty nice. I caught a dungeoness crab with my bare hands there.
I forget the name of the place there is a small restaurant  there with awesome  clam chowder
I'm assuming you got the soul stone
Haystack rock is pretty cool. There's a shot of it in The Goonies.
/r/vaporwaveaesthetics
Beautiful.
That's beautiful!
This is on my bucket list.

"Hey look, it's them goobers... no Wait they're just seaguls"
Headed there the next couple weekends
"needed this, thank you :)"
nice picture and happy cakeday
It's soo beautiful
The tide pools are the best part
"This looks ethereal, i love it!"
Reminds me of Life Is Strange
"I used to go out there every year, man I miss the beach there. 

Not to mention the candy shop, and their PB&J taffy..."
That is my hometown!
Mine too!
Happy cake day!
This the type of place I imagine I would like to die.
I live ten minutes south of here and just came back home from school. I will never get over how blessed and beautiful our coast is.
HEEEYYY YOU GUUUYSS!!!
Grew up in OR and I tell ya what we have MULTIPLE places this beautiful. It's a great place to live.
i’m going to newport this weekend with some pals! this photo got me excited for it
Unreal.
Great photo. This looks like Snoopy Island in Fujairah.. but much nicer!

So many insanely beautiful earth porn posts are in Oregon. Have to make it there on my next US trip!
ty really amazing place
I can understand why its your favourute place on earth. Its just so beautiful and magic
Happy Cake day! :)
I agree most awesome place!
I miss living in Oregon. Best one year of my life.
Always reminds me of [this campaign log](https://web.archive.org/web/20080724190959/http://www.andycollins.net/Campaigns/Bloodlines/c01_starting_campaign.htm) I read ages ago. It's a cool place!
Looks like a cover for a syntwave album
"This is beautiful.  I'm going to be visiting Astoria in the next few weeks, might have to make a detour."
Sunsets there are dreamlike and lingering.
Need it in hi res chief. Wallpaper material right here
You will also sometimes see puffins.
Happy cake day and sick picture!
Why is it called cannon Beach?
"A few years ago, my dad and I decided we should just start driving down 101 and we just kept going for a few hours. I honestly couldn't even tell you exactly where we ended up, but this does look extremely familiar... It's by far one of my favorite memories. Absolutely gorgeous place."
"Been going to CB since the 70's. We usually stayed in Seaside and did a day trip down to Tillamook and back always driving through CB. When Seaside was getting a little run down, we switched to staying at CB. Now it's few and far between. Beachside motels are charging up the wah-zoo for a room. We get a seaside room because if the weather turns to sh!t, at least we get to weather watch. Also cool is to walk all the neighborhood streets and check out the cool mini gardens.  Is Pizza-a'fetta still operating down there? We use to take a large pizza with us on the way back home."
OR what?
"Especially with the Bi flag colors in the sky.

Makes you proud to be an Oregonian."
"loved going there to my grandma as a kid, beautiful!"
 Bonjour voisins
"Oregonian here! I love the Oregon Coast.  It's so beautiful.  My family stays on the coast for a week each year, with smaller trips in between.  I could never live in another state. 

Beautiful job!"
Wow looks gorgeous
My wife wants us to move there so bad but there is no way. The housing cost is insane. The times we have visited though was amazing. Love Astoria.
is there an hd version?
I’d love to visit this place.  So recognisable (yes I loved Goonies)
Nice!
"I love this photo. I love that beach, but wow, what a photo. Thank you for sharing.

Sidenote: I love and miss Oregon so much. I am from WA and wondered if visitors are welcome again yet."
Andy!  You Goonie!
Nobody else sees the bisexual pride flag?
Damn that's beautiful
Magic in the air
This reminds me of star wars
Haha. The beach from the end of The Goonies! My gf and I walked that beach when we visited Portland for a wedding. Worth the 2 hour drive.
Is this even Earth?
Thankyou for my new desktop wallpaper :)
That is absolutely beautiful!
Did they ever find one eyed Willie's rich stuff?
Happy Cake Day
ahh do you have a higher res copy of the image? I want to use this as a wallpaper
"The Oregon Coast  stays winning, even if we can't go in the water."
My dad uses Oxyclean all the time lol
Good luck finding a parking spot so that you can actually see it. I've lived in the biggest cities and almost left Cannon Beach out of so much frustration (after sitting in gridlock traffic from Portland) because I could. not. park. That is one of the only things I remember about it.
"Lol wow I was at the monument on Friday and captured the very same dude. Your photo is better than mine, though. https://imgur.com/a/EPFvRFw"
"I'd so much love to have this as my wallpaper! Would you mind sharing a high quality version if this, if you have it?"
Bunch a goonies out there
"Mine too. Falcon cove, manzanita. I miss these places terribly,  and so does my dog.  Beautiful and peaceful"
Hey! My ex and I had a beach house in Seaside. I absolutely loved that area and hope to visit again one day.
Great pic
Yo where's the cannon?
iPhone Wallpaper
Lovely. Bonus: kill a loved on that mountain and wake up on the beach with the soul stone!
"Lol wow I was at the monument on Friday and captured the very same dude. Your photo is better than mine, though. https://imgur.com/a/EPFvRFw"
Juno Beach was one of them lol
That's stunning
I've been there. It's a gorgeous place and if I remember right there was a really good pizza place near the beach.
The only place I know of.
"I’m from nw wa.   Cannon beach has been my favorite place ever for 30+ years.

Hopefully I live long enough to retire in the area."
I have a friend named after that beach.
Been there a few times it’s nothing special.
Looks beautiful
It gonna be a good desktop wallpaper. May I ask for exported jpeg?
Looollll I saw a kind of down to earth
"Wait,  is this the same beach from the Goonies?!"
"My bestie and I went there for my birthday. Fed the rabbits, seagulls... It was cool. 
I wish my buddy lived in the same state as I."
Kid is gonna be my favorite from Gaiman
My wife and I went on our honeymoon there! It holds a special place in my heart! Beautiful picture!
beautiful. looks like a stone guarded by a floating guy with a red skull is hiding there
Love that place.
The sky is beautiful. Feels like something out of a movie with those colors.
Beautiful
That place just behind the picture has the best Clam Chowder I've ever eaten.
This is amazing.
I grew up there
yea it’s OC
"I recognized that pic as I was scrolling by. One of my fav places on earth.  I love that You can go an hour, hour and a half in one direction and see that, or go the other and be up in the mountains.  Go south and you have crater lake, north you have multnomah falls.  Oregon is so beautiful."
My goodness that’s*gorgeous*.
people need to stop hating on my boy phreak
"My best friends were married on that beach, so I got to see it in person.  Absolutely beautiful.  Pictures really don’t do it justice.  Bookended by forest cliffs.  Bioluminescent algae in the sand at night.  An awesome place."
Hey you guys!!!
"This place will always have a special place in my heart. Not only for it’s beautiful scenery, but also because this is where I proposed to my now wife! Best. Day. Ever!"
Chester Copperpot?
"Oh my god. I've been here and didn't realize until now. Was probably 4 or 5. Went with my family to the PNW on vacation. We hiked through the forest to get to the beach. I remember being able to see through the trees the bright white of the overcast reflecting off of the sand and surf. When we got to the water, the sand was lousy with driftwood and splinters, so my mother made us keep our shoes on. Huge, gnarled roots and branches, some that looked like whole trees, some still kicking around in the tide. My father was a swimmer. He kept daring himself to swim out to one of the rocks, and us kids would scream No and beg him to stay on the beach with us. Tall tongues of the ocean kept lapping at the rocks from afar and curling around the driftwood where we stood. It was the day after the storm. It was the day before the next one. He took off his shoes and dipped his toes in the water. That's when he stepped on glass and split his foot open. He wrapped his foot with a handkerchief, put his shoe back on, and hobbled back to the car for the first aid kit. My mother scolded him the whole way. We watched the light of the beach disappear behind us as we followed our fearless father back to safety.  

Thanks, OP! This is a memory I didn't know I had. It's good to remember something nice. Pictures look like the forest is thick with houses. Is any part of it open woods? Want to make sure I'm not misremembering the place where this happened. I'm assuming there could be other Oregonian beaches with giant rocks in the water."
"I mean, it’s ok. I think most people just say “oh yeah the place from goonies”"
Now I want to go to there
Last summer I drove over 1000 miles to see this beach. Worth it.
"I’ve been going to Cannon Beach with my family every year since I was a kid. I turned 30 this year, and I still feel the magic of this place. My mom was diagnosed with ALS 6 months ago, and we booked a family trip almost immediately after we got the news. No matter how bad things get, this beach always manages to make us smile."
Yup. It’s official. That’s where I want to drive to see the Pacific Ocean from Connecticut. Don’t need California!
u/repostsleuthbot
It’s mine and the wife’s favourite place too...
this is awesome!
Goonies?
Will I get soul stone there?
Goonies never say die.
Happy cake day :)
i thought it was Vormir
You need to travel more.
That's so bi

Please don't move here.  Everyone else already has.  We're at capacity.  Visit but don't stay.
Looks like a place you bring a friend and get the soul stone.
That looks like home of the soul stone
Vormir...!!!
Mine is porn 1080p
"From there. Gorgeous. Be sure and check out Pacific City, Oceanside, Astoria and Bandon. Heck the whole coast is magic and there is brew everywhere."
Hey you guy-uys!!!
That is in one of the scene in the goonies
I don't know. Yeah I love the Goonies! But Oceanside is pretty nice too. I like caves though. Lol beautiful pic though thank you for sharing!
"Hello, where is it?"
It does. My wife was cool as fuck
Stop repping Oregon so hard. I love it here too but you don't gotta let everyone know how great it is here.
Nah mate this is where you get the Soul Stone
Happy cake day! It’s my cake day too!
"I once raised a wooden fort some kid had made on the beach.

I felt bad about it the next day, but I'd been drinking a bottle of overpriced rum and had spent hours already collecting firewood from any place I could see. The last place was this kid's  6ft by 6ft fort he made--which explains why it was so hard for me to get other wood in the area. Drunk me from the rural part of the country said ""I AM CHIEF, WANT BIG FIRE!"" And the 1 or 2 people out still at 1 am watched as the last beacon of Gondor was razed.


Cool place. Bit tourist trappy though."
Same.
Looks exactly like vormir from Avengers.
Heeeey yooouuuu guuuyyysss!!!!!
The Goonies rock?

Nah this is Vormir where the soul stone is
"I'm surprised you weren't fined $1,200 for getting too close to haystack rock."
Garbage place for born again Karen’s! Stolen from Natives.
Reminds me of the goonies
"I ended up here by accident the one time I visited Oregon.  I'd never seen the pacific & I was in Portland with access to a car, so we drove west, had breakfast at the Pig N' Pancake, and then walked down to the beach.  It was completely overcast and was misting & crazy windy.  My dad didn't understand why I was grinning like a maniac.  I loved it and I've wanted to go back ever since."
That’s some Goonies shit right there
"I’m in the Southeastern US and my work took me to Cannon Beach last year. I had never been to a beach where the tidepools were so alive. I never wanted to leave, it’s gorgeous there. Our beaches near the gulf are beautiful but you have starfish and algae and barnacles and so many other cool things!!"
"Yeah, the tourists leave."
Hello neighbor
I went two years ago and it was raining like crazy and the wind was blowing hard but it was still a beautiful place. I didn’t stay long because of the weather  but I really wanna go back  just don’t know when
I spent the summer there. Sand Lake Recreation Area is where I volunteered for the forest service. I can honestly say that it's the most spectacular place to have sex on the beach.  Central and NE Oregon are really beautiful. I had a great time there. Hebo Mountain will stay with me forever. Seeing the fog roll in with the moon shining on top of it. Truly an incredible place.
"That look so gorgeous, i would love to wake up to this sight every day 

Just stunning"
"Cannon beach is our fav. Vacation destination. We stay there for 3-4 days when ever we go and take a day trip to Seaside for all the activities there! The view from the Ecola state park is to die for! Totally agree with what you said - love it more when it is stormy! 

We started doing yearly trips ever since we discovered and stayed by the Beach in 2010 with view of Haystay rock. We like it during Spring and Fall more than Summer to avoid the crowds and to get a good mix of  Botha storms and possibly have a sunny day!

We have always wanted to spend 3-4 weeks one of these days and totally relax and enjoy CB.  If you are aware of good long term rentals by the beach let me know!"
Question: Do you know a little campground somewhere around there that’s tucked back into the forest off of the main road? Wish I could find it again
My god. I am adding corgi day to my bucket list.
I go to Corgi Beach Day every year and it’s absolutely amazing. Never gets old.
"That level of busy is essentially the norm most days of the week, especially if it’s warmer inland, from normally June through mid September. Every year it is exponentially busier then the last. Honestly I don’t think it’s worth the effort fighting the crowds to visit in July through early September. The towns not big enough for the crowds that descend upon it."
Ay dios mio!
That’s my mother’s favorite part!!
"It's Oregon, there is a brewery everywhere.  It's a requirement for any town with a population of 1,000."
De garde?
"And it literally being a Goonies backdrop is powerful. Man, I fucking miss Oregon."
"If you’re referring to the Pelican Brewpub that is right on the beach, that one is in Pacific City Oregon, located at the other famous Haystack Rock (there are actually 3 different “Haystack Rock” on the Oregon coast). There is a Pelican Brewpub location in Cannon Beach also, but it’s not directly on the beach, it’s like a block away."
You're thinking of pacific city. Pelican Brew Pub. PC also has a haystack rock.
I visited northern Oregon a couple years back and I’m so ready to check out the rest of the state
"Shhhhh stop


SEASIDE IS GREAT KEEP GOING THERE PEOPLE."
"Right? Manzanita! Ahhhh. If you wanna see what the end of the world looks like, go to Manzanita."
"A few of them every summer. The first time my gf (from VA) and I went to a beach, she immediately saw what it means to ""never turn your back on the sea."""
No this is planet bisexual
Yeah something like that
Was just about to say that when I saw it lol. Beautiful place.
Yes! That was so wild! I thought I was mental. What is that?
Whoa. You're me. Went there growing up and honeymooned there.
Same! Stayed at the Stephanie Inn and had an amazing view and time.
"Got to love Pacific City, too! That sand dune at Cape Kiwanda has a breathtaking view."
Hell yes Lincoln City is incredible! I went there for the Solar Eclipse. I should have stayed.
Depoe bay for me! Lincoln city is pretty great too.
It’s awesome. I lived there when I was a kid and my pops built a few houses in that town. Haven’t been back in a long time.
Happy cake day!
Happy cake day!
Happy cake day! It’s my cake day too :)
"They also use Ecola State Park, and a beach in California."
"That, or possibly a beach where you might be looking for a pirate ship, because your homes are being sold to make condos, so you need to find the treasure to help your parents keep their homes. You know… Because you grew up together and childhood and shit."
">Edited?

Processed to hell and back, but it's a pretty looking image."
"Idk man, if I'm being honest, there are some days in late fall when it starts getting chilly, and the clouds open up just before the sun sets, and you get sky's that look a lot like this."
"I’ve been there a thousand times, love it every time, but this was the most spectacular sunset I’ve ever seen there. I added some contrast with an s-curve, IIRC, but I have like 40 shots that all look like this."
"My friends tease me for being a basic ""the mountains are calling me"" bitch, but I really did leave my heart in Oregon. One day I'll leave behind the red clay of Georgia for good and smell those ponderosas once more!"
"Go Dawgs! Covington (basically Kent if you don't know the area) native here.

Lived in McMinnville, OR until I was 7, still have fond memories of Cannon Beach and the Oregon Coast. Moving back to Western WA from San Diego in a couple months and can't wait for the epic road trip. 

By the way, u/PacificNorthwest206 you absolutely scored on that username."
I'm going on a road trip from BC to Ocean Shores. Looks nice down there.
"As posted earlier, this is what it looked like. I didn’t do almost anything with it other than an s-curve for contrast."
If anyone shouldn’t have nice things
1.) It’s your waifu or something
id just crop it using an image editing software
Just use this one? It gets scaled anyways
"Yeah we do that whenever we go! We caught 40+ of them one year, but all females except for two, so back they went."
That's what I thought too.

">This the type of place I imagine I would like to die.

Good news! Oregon is one of the few places where assisted suicide is legal."
"Best way. Fly to Portland. Rent a car and drive to the coast, make sure to visit rock away beach  and hug point before you get there"
"A part. 


Most of the movie was filmed in Astoria, Oregon"
I actually didn’t touch it much. You may have to take your color perception preferences up with camera manufacturers.
"Sunsets on the NW pacific coasts are extremely pink and purple during the late spring through summer months. How do I know? Oregonian here, since birth, 30+ years now. It's amazing when you see it in person, if it's not too overcast or raining, it can and does like this on occasion."
^(don’t hang out at home.)
Cannon beach oregon
Too late. Moving there within 2 years
"I’ve been alllllll over this little blue planet, I am aware that there are beautiful places. I just personally like this one the best, you know?"
"A couple years ago, my wife and I hosted a pair of Afghan refugees in our mother-in-law apartment in our house. They’d grown up around Kandahar, and had, until they came here, never been more than 50 miles from where they were born. As such, the largest body of water they had ever seen was the arghandab reservoir, a little man-made lake behind a dam.

One Saturday, we asked them if they’d like to see the ocean and they got excited and said yes, so we drove them out to Cannon Beach.

I found it was interesting that the things they found most memorable about their first experience with the ocean was how loud the sand was, and how *high* the water was. With 6+ foot breakers, the waves stand quite a ways up compared to the still waters of a reservoir, and they found that particularly strange. I don’t know if you had the same experience, but I had never thought about the ocean as being tall before, but now I can’t unsee it.

They also called the seagulls ducks, as there aren’t any seagulls in Afghanistan."
"There is a literal ""stormy weather arts festival"" in CB every year. Done in the stormiest season and the whole town does an art show. Its wonderful."
This almost exactly what we did. We drove from Seattle down to San Francisco one year. We’re from the uk so everything was just so incredible. Canon Beach and Pig n Pancake still bring back a smile almost 12 years later. We plan to do the same trip when the kids are older
"As someone who grew up out there, this put me through a wide range of emotions. Glad you got to witness the beauty of the Oregon coast in person"
Yeah that's where they filmed it.
"Yes! I am also from the Southeast and I spent hours and hours looking at the tidepools here! Seeing the anemone and starfish zone lower down, the transition to mussels, how the mussels are bigger the lower they are but can't grow too low or starfish will eat them. Then barnacles higher up and just seagull poop above that! And mole crabs and other critters skirting around the water. The starfish and anemones were my favorite part and I even saw some baby starfish floating around in the water. It looked like an aquarium habitat!"
Exactly!
You are corgially invited
Always  separate the drugs.
No... No pen... No sign... NO SIGN!
I drank at Pelican and ate at atoms Fish and Chips on Thursday. Then headed down to Smugglers Cove.
"Dispensaries everywhere too, like in California they really are not super common outside the big cities. In Oregon there is a dispensary every twenty miles in small towns all over the state. Never farther than a half hour away from legally bought weed"
"It's true. Even the tiny retirement town of Bandon has at least one. God, I love Oregon."
"De Garde is about an hour’s drive south in Tillamook. Cannon Beach has Bill’s Brewpub, Public Coast, and a brewing branch of Pelican. Until March, they also had the Cannon Beach Distillery, too, which made great local spirits."
De garde is so good!
"That’s in Tillamook, which is a little farther south. Great beer and taproom, though."
"I highly recommend Crater Lake, but also venturing a bit south into the tip of Northern California. Mount Shasta is beautiful, and about an hour north-east of it is Glass Mountain. Seeing actual flows of obsidian is pretty cool."
You saw the best part.
LOL.....pretending like people don't already go to Canon Beach in droves.
Wish I could upvote more than once
"Oh I thought all sand was squeaky, is that not true?"
An s-curve for contrast. This is what it looked like. Take up your color perception preferences with Panasonic.
You're a Oregon to Georgia transplant too?! Where in Georgia? I moved from (NY) to Salem to Atlanta and still dream of the PNW all the time
"Haha... Reading this in Kent as we speak. 

Need to take a drive soon to canon beach. Gotta show my two lil girls some goonies stuff and just an all around kick ass place.

Hi from Kent!"
Oooh thanks for the tip.  Much appreciated
"I live in California, I know about great sunsets."
That's a really cute story :) wholesome af
Man that was so fucking cool to hear about your Afghan friends experience.
"Dude, ocean be tall as shit.

I go to a place near forks with friends and that  big log that gets posted all the time is tiny. We’ve had our cabins buried in like 15 ft of sea foam."
"I'm moving to southern CA this year with my girlfriend, so my hope is that once I'm settled there, I'll have time to drag her up to Oregon for some sightseeing, hiking, & camping, so I'm hopefully getting my return trip soon."
Camp 18 on the way to the coast. Giant cinnamon rolls and a really neat logging collection.
"I couldn’t agree more! However, in recent years I’ve been grabbing brunch at the Wayfarer. Good food with a view."
No. That’s Astoria.
And the rabbits hide.
Oh you
You sound like a pirate
My favorite place personally is the Cannon Beach Smokehouse. It's fairly small but the meat platters are great. I just kept ordering extra stuff until I about exploded.
A proper way to enjoy the Oregon coast!
God I love that my grandma lives in Tillamook. This area of Oregon is a second home
"Are these places making you wear a mask the whole time? How’s that actually work? Tried to read pelicans website but it was vague. Specifically pelican, I went to Toms recently too

Sorry if you’re someone who’s offended by this question"
Pelican is great. Also had some great salmon at The Wayfarer
"I’m sure Toms wasn’t bad for you, but everything is frozen and shipped in. No local caught fish, chowder shipped in bags from Seattle. Probably one of the least “local” places you can eat in cannon beach. And they don’t really treat their employees very well. Just a heads up. May I suggest Ecola seafood market next time? Very fresh, local family ran."
"Pfft, if you're in Portland proper, they are every twenty FEET."
Even mitchel has one now
Did Cannon Beach distilling close its doors permanently from the pandemic? I would head there for some of their gins once or  twice a year.
"If Cannon Beach Distillery closed, that’s just the worst news. That place was amazing. Great liquor and the owner was super friendly, plus they had an N64"
"Southern Oregon is pretty amazing man, Ashland in the rogue valley is one of the cutest towns in the nation - and of course crater lake is south too"
"Ngl people go to Canon Beach, but it doesn't come close to the sheer amount of people at Seaside for some reason..."
It depends but cannon beach sand has a certain consistency that I haven't found at any of the other Oregon beaches
"Been there, done that. Now you can"
[deleted]
"If you find the time, take the pacific coast highway all the way up. Best drive in the country. I could stare at the Oregon coastline all day long. I’ve been to about 40 of the 50 states (and four of the Canadian provinces) and the entire Pacific coast is my favorite, but Oregon has my heart. 

If you do make the trek, don’t forget to stop at the original Pronto Pup in Rockaway Beach for possibly the best corn dog you’ll ever eat (they also have Tillamook “cheese dogs “ which are just battered, fried slabs of Tillamook cheddar)."
"Southern CA has some good sites to drive through as well :) check out Oceanside, Pacifica, maybe even Monterey or Fort Bragg if you are willing to drive farther north. Skip SF."
Camp 18! Shit. I have a t shirt. I miss OR
"They filmed scenes both places. Astoria is only 40 minutes away, if that."
CB Smokehouse?
Just a little north of Cannon is my personal favorite beach town Seaside.
Hell yes. The Bloody Mary they make with smoked tomatoes is so damn good.
"Tillamook, besides the cheese factory, Blue Heron, the endless cowshit odor, the smokehouse, the air museum, and a bunch of other cool stuff, is also home to de Garde, one of the very few entirely spontaneous breweries in the United States, and arguably one of the best breweries in the country as well. They also picked their location in Tillamook for the superb local microflora, which they found by careful testing."
That's fake-sorry. Do you enjoy offending others by not wearing a mask?
He was closing his doors already due to heavy olcc fees. Had been planning it for months. You can find an article about it on the daily Astorian website
"And the Oregon caves are kind of south, central-ish? But those are dope too."
Yeah the north coast is awesome but I also love Bend. Lots to see in Oregon.
"Yes they do, cb is a shit show from June through September. I’m constantly hearing about people who come down mid day and can’t find any where to park in the whole town and have to leave. Cannon Beach hits its max on people many days in the summer."
It needs to be wet underneath with dry sand on top. It's a particular weather and tide condition that causes it -- not necessarily the sand.
Hug point is way more squeaky in my experience
Dont forget big sur

I think they count on folks not knowing the law and not fighting them on it. Not likely the homeless person can google up why the cop is wrong or will be likely show up in court to fight it.

Comment
That writer is an asshole..not a shock who he writes for.
I can only hope that the sale of Star Wars had a few asterisks written by George
Please don't
"They should just remaster and re-release the exact originals without old Georgie boys garbage remastered additions. They’d make a shit ton of money putting them out that way. Han shot first! And what the hell was that music concert at Jabba’s palace, I was embarrassed for them watching it."
"#NO PLEASE NO, THEY ARE PERFECT THE WAY THEY ARE, DON'T TOUCH THEM."
"It would be like:

Disney: hey George please fix the new star wars movies, by the way, were rebooting the original trilogy"
That's not even happening lmao. The writer says should.. Nothing to do with Disney
The whole thing no but the new cgi maybe?Upgraded effects?
I SWEAR TO GOD IF THEY REBOOTED EMPIRE AND RUINED MY FAVORITE MOVIE IM DINE WITH STAR WARS
"There's no nead for a total remake. I could see a new CGI version where they remake all the space scenes that they did with miniatures using modern CGI and that could probably look really cool.

But they'll also probably change some more shit that didn't need changing and ruin it"
"Remakes? No fucking way. But I do think a majorly remastered version would be super awesome. Kind of like how the blu-ray versions had little extra scenes in them, or were edited to look nicer. They could release Disney+ exclusive remastered versions.

Like, I'm sure most of you have probably seen the video on youtube where fans remade the fight between Kenobi and Vader. (If not, seriously check it out here: https://youtu.be/to2SMng4u1k )
Stuff like that in the OT would be super cool. It could really tie OT and the Prequels together really nicely."
True fact: A Star Wars movie isn’t really a Star Wars movie if there isn’t a “I have a bad feeling about this”.
I agree they should re write it but have Don Cheadle act everyone
Do I *want* it to happen? I dunno. Would I be *surprised* if it happened? Absolutely not
No God please no
Pretty sure they already did that with the Sequel Trilogy...
"I don't know why people are even worried about this, it'll never happen"
"So Luke and Han are women, Chewbacca is trans, Leia is a dude that needs to be rescued and Vader is their mother.

""Noooo I AM YOUR MOMMA."""
"You can't remake something beautiful, only create a pale imitation. I say theyve raped Star Wars enough, let the poor thing die in peace."
Doesn’t even make sense
They need to reboot their own trilogy
We should outlaw Kofi Outlaw
Just block that site from your feeds. It's good for your mental health.

"Disney should remake episodes 1,2,3,7,8,9...

But I think the author it's just being a troll."
They should remake all of the ones they just fricken made.
Could have sworn they already did that with episode 4.
Comicbook.com is a plague of the internet. Along with Vox and BuzzFeed.
OMG how did I not realize they were going to shit money onto a legacy. This is definitely going to be made or at least seriously considered
Only thing they should remake is rouge one in the style of a 70s-90s movie to fire the OT more.
"They were already remade. Twice. Thrice? Wait, 4 times? I give up. Maclunkey."
Hot take: Disney should stop remaking movies in general.
* Starts complaining about how similar The new A New Hope is to The Force Awakens *
Did they already do that with the special editions?

No way. It would be aweful

we gotta make it a 50-50 tie?
Fuck you. Fuck you right in the face.
Am I wrong to actually be cool with this idea?
Disney should remake the prequels in the style of The Clone Wars.
if you do thaat then it wont be original anymore
I mean a remake wouldn't be bad but if it's not a 1:1 remake then it cannot be good.
"Agree, all I can think about now."
The internet was a mistake
NOOOOOOOOO NOOOOAGHHhhOoo
We need high quality 4k render photorealistic beautifully animated JarJar
on a related note: close the blast door!
"I say do it.

Lets see how much money Disney can lose and not go bankrupt."
They already remade ANH though.
Seriously if this actually happens im smack someone over the head with a power drill battery
"[Uh, they are kind of already doing that?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tK8yWraR6k)"
Ummm didn’t y’all see episode 7? They already tried the remake thing.
"What about annakiss, irene’s boyfriend?"
"No, no I don't think they should"
April 1st was gone. Please.
Can i kill that writer? Please...
they should remake the prequels tbh
I would only accept it if it’s in the clone wars style and Filoni is in charge
"no, fuck no, FUCK NO"
I’m not about cancel culture.... but this guy needs to be cancelled.
"Lol they already did but in hardcore bad with 7,8,9"
"Disney should remake the Sequel movies, and actually thread some plot through the trilogy without relying on video games, comics and crappy novelisations in the future to flesh out their omissions."
"Thats still gonna be a video up on some handles, remove risers, so that dog is normally cared for, but it reduces the acid, making it look good. I want in on this too. Do you have instacart or anything near you? I tried to dive off a higher board, I had to (before surgery), I was shitting until only clear water came out. It is, after all the lies he said about it. For some people police can do good but in it's current state it is nothing but a little splash and these Fox will immediately cry white ""oppression"" as if we weren't already great. Fuck that, he can breathe."
"I'm sure the first ones have offended multiple groups of people, some yet to be invented so it has to be redone.  If you disagree you are racist. /s"
He said truth from a certain point of view
I’m afraid that would cause a war in the Star Wars fandom because no matter how good it is it will never live up to the originals the clone wars are upon us
They already have lmao
Well they already remade a new hope
"They already did, it's called the Sequels."
"2.5 hours of *nooooooo* and Ben Kenobi is actually a woke minority georgious grey-zone lesbian who is somehow 5 years older than Luke - who is actually recast as Leia, and when Ben comes into screen they cut the boring stuff aka ""character development"" and whisks Luke off to the spaceport where they find han peacefully trying to negotiate with a team of assassins blasting at him and escape in the falcon - which now actually looks like a falcon but smooth because CGI - and they fuck off to alderaan but in the meantime Leia - who is now Luke - has been seduced by the boyish charms of Darth Vader and for some reason Vader is not dressed in black his outfit is chartreuse but it's not much of an outfit anymore they recycle a model from the Borg anyway they seduce Luke into revealing the location of the rebel base and turn around and blast it but not just the moon but the planet and star as well but in a surprise twist because they have to subvert expectations it turns out Luke was telling the truth and the base was on alderaan, the rebels are extinguished, the falcon is destroyed by an asteroid and so there's no need for you people to watch stars war anymore it's completely ruined now I'm gonna piss in your cornflakes."
The only trilogy that needs remaking is the sequels
I'd be totally cool with them redoing them...  ...With the original cast VO in the artstyle that they do the shorts on SWKids youtube channel!
"So what's the point of remaking the movies? They already remade a movie that was terrible and made a great movie with it and made the Sequel Trilogy even worse. I know they could make more money with it, but they are already a billion dollar company and they don't need to do more than that to make money. It's a waste of time and money. Even if it"
"They already did, it’s called the sequels"
They already did a few years ago
isn't force awakens a remake of a new hope?
Wanna see a trilogy fail?..... wanna see it again?
"I mean every star wars film is good , they should remake it exactly the same but with better graphics and lightsaber duels, and make fett more BA"
They already did!
"Eh, I agree. I think if Disney WERE to do this, they definitely would need to keep 100% of the original’s story and plot points, and perhaps even do shot for shot recreations, but with updated camera techniques and scene framing, plus adding more generic action/war scenes. 

I’d want to see Sebastian Stan as Luke
Alden Ehrenreich as Han
Donald Glover as Lando
Ewan McGregor as Ben Kenobi
Ian McDiarmid as The Emperor
Then either the woman who played Leia in Rogue One Ingvild Diela, or Billie Lourde, as Leia

As for the other characters like R2-D2, C-3PO, Chewbacca, Yoda, Jabba The Hutt, Boba Fett, and Vader, I’d say to just recycle their lines from the originals, or have their voice actors come in and record new lines/re-record the old ones too. I’d say to just recycle their lines from the originals, or have them record new lines over the old ones, because I know Anthony Daniels, James Earl Jones, Frank Oz, and Temuera Morrison are all getting REALLY old, and some of them are going to be leaving us soon. Though, I do think it’s important to bring them, and as much of the original cast in, to make sure the remakes are as true to the original trilogy as possible.

Basically, I wouldn’t want a reboot. Just a remake/remaster, with modern filming techniques and better framed scenes with improved dialogue delivery, extra action scenes and more intense lightsaber duels, with new actors and actresses but 100% of the original story and dialogue lines (except for maybe the contradiction lines, like Darth Vader in Ep 4 being referred to as “the last of the ancient extinct Jedi religion”, or how Ben calls Vader “Darth” as if that’s his first name."
They already had JJ remake Episodes 4 and 6
But they just did

"Even if there wasn't any Disney aren't going to remake the OT, they know it wouldn't bring them any good. And besides that just because they remake their own old animated movies I don't think they've ever remade a live action movie (except I guess Pete's Dragon), and they certainly wouldn't something as iconic as Star Wars."
"doesn't matter, it's not like the good old stuff will disappear and we can still enjoy the few good things that come out of the new Star Wars like Mando and CW S7"
Greedo never shot (or screamed) at all.
Just remove the ronto that walks past the screen when they are asked about their identification that’s all I care about everything else can stay
Amen brother! I've been preaching this since the special editions first came out. At least there's 4K77 or the Despecialized versions to keep us going!
Despecialized edition is worth a mention and download if that's what you're looking for.
"Not all of them. I like some, like the end music in episode 6"
https://gfycat.com/immensebiodegradablecarp
South park indiana Jones?
That’s what I was thinking too. I don’t mind the CGI in the OT but it would be cool to see with modern day effects. I would like to see the lightsaber fights with more action but I think it would go overboard and mess up lots of the fights. My heart wants to see Ben Kenobi have an epic duel with Vader but my mind knows it won’t be the same.
There are sequels?
"What I fear the most is the change of actors that they can do.

Already the change of Harrison Ford for Aldren Ehrenreich was quite wrong and I am afraid of those who can catch for the rest of the roles. Instead I have to admit that even though Billy Dee Williams is better, Daniel Glover as Lando did well."
That’s exactly what I was thinking. It would be super cool to see something close to the prequels fighting in the OT but I’m scared they’ll change characters around and mess up scenes entirely.
">Remakes? No fucking way. But I do think a majorly remastered version would be super awesome. Kind of like how the blu-ray versions had little extra scenes in them, or were edited to look nicer. They could release Disney+ exclusive remastered versions.

"Kill him, kill him now"
I thought they already did that?
"Keep in mind that if Disney goes bankrupt, it will never be able to do the Obi Wan series or finish The Mandalorian.  So for now disney has to keep running"
Prequels messes up in a bunch of places but I still like them. Not really for their exact scenes but for the overall plot that George was going for. I loved seeing Anikan go from a sweet little boy to a conflicted teen then grow up more and then eventually switch to the dark side. The duel with Anikan and Obi wan was the best and really tied up everything. Watching the Clone Wars series really helped me appreciate the characters more since we see Anikan and how he turned from a fierce warrior of the Republic to Vader.
Yeah no thanks
Don't underestimate the power of the corpobitch
"Yeah, they had some pretty good ideas in the sequels, but the way they were executed was so horrible. Not to mention, some of their ideas plainly sucked balls"
But they have no source material.......won’t someone give them some source material.....looks at giant pile of EU material......
A certain point of view?
Make money to invest in future projects and give an alternative version of the official story
"They've remade plenty of live action properties, such as The Shaggy Dog, The Parent Trap, and Freaky Friday (which they remade twice). Granted, I don't think a bunch of remakes of mid to low budget family films indicates that they're willing to remake a film on the scale of ANH, I just wanted to set the record straight."
I am the only one who thinks his would be acceptable BUT ONLY if they use all the original voice lines and scores but do the characters like Leia in ep9
"> they know it wouldn't bring them any good.

Explain the new trilogy then."
"https://youtu.be/to2SMng4u1k

Just watch that. Bit over dramatic but still pretty sweet."
"Common misconception, some people think the prequels are sequels since they were released after the ot but non the less it is in face a prequel not a sequel"
*Donald Glover
Watch episode 7
"I shouldn't, it's not the Jedi way."
They did?
"Disney has lot of things in motion like that all female series they announced last month.

By the time they get to The Reboot, Mandalorian will be over.

BTW in bankruptcy intellectual property like Star Wars goes to some other company, it doesn't disappear. So hopefully someone better will do a better job."
"i didn't mean change the story or plot, just remake it to easier and more interesting movie to watch and especially fix the pacing of the second one"
"Yeah I forgot. They had nothing to work with. No 800 page novels, no comic books, no pe-written scripts for an entire trilogy, nothing"
"So instead of remaking an animated move as a live movie, they should remake a live one animated?"
Yes
"Ruins the whole point of the original fight IMO. I know people like to say this fight is boring in the original, but this kind of thing is out of character for old Obi-Wan... it’s like comparing Empire Yoda to the cartwheeling Muppet in the prequels. Not everything needs to be a cool lightsaber battle"
"True, sorry for the mistake"
Wdym
Dew It!!
Im on board with that!
The movie takes place in 1953
"Yes, the beautifulness and greatness of the best trilogy and the modern day effects"
When thinking about his overall age Yoda isn't much older in the ot than the prequels
It's a joke. Implying ep 7 basically copied the plot of a new hope
The Force Awakens (Episode 7) is just a remake of A New Hope (Episode 4)
I'd love to see the Death Star 2 battle with modern CGI tbh.
"Even taking age out of it, he spends most of the prequels as an old man hobbling around on a cane, with his connection to the Force being a more spiritual one... they didn’t have to have multiple scenes where he throws his cane away, takes out a tiny lightsaber, and spins around like a monkey on meth, just to have another unnecessary lightsaber scene.

To quote Kreia from KOTOR 2:

>	A lightsaber - any weapon - only achieves worth in how it is wielded - in the effort, the struggle of one who holds it. Such a weapon does not make a Jedi or a Sith. And at times, it makes them much, much less than they are.

“Yoda is a Jedi so he must have a tiny lightsaber and do flips” was one of the dumber things in the prequels IMO. Imagine two masters of the Force having a mental battle without lightsabers- in the style of [the tea house scene in Hero](https://youtu.be/AeeoEpmyb2Y), where the battle takes place only in their minds. This is what I picture when I watch the fight between Vader and Obi-Wan- they battled on a mental level, and Obi-Wan only lost the lightsaber fight because he lost the battle of will as well. Vader was stronger than he was in the Force, and that’s why Obi-Wan lost- not because he was necessarily better at fighting with lightsabers."
Ye
True
yeah that sounds great. the original trilogy with some added and updated visual effects. umm... like a star wars special edition...
"You take that back, the Yoda fight scenes were awesome"
"Fair point.

I'd love to see the Death Star 2 battle redone in CGI by a competent team who know what they shouldn't be doing.

And George Lucas is kept at least 10m away."

It's pretty close but not exactly the same thing. So then I decided to see if dolphinsex.org was still up and running. I typed it into chrome and all that came up was a page of links for adult dating websites. I find this hilarious. It's like they thought if you are lonely enough to look up an old website about dolphin sex, you could really use some links to human dating websites."

And what did you wear when the dolphin raped you?
You seem to speak from experience I see.
I would assume there is some danger of drowning too.
'reposting on this' love it
Xaxaxaxa
"Nah, that's the face of someone who just got an assfull of dolphin."
Makes me cry every time
"Its boring, I tried my own ass wasn’t that fun ._. I think private areas feel good because part of it is that you’re breaking someone’s privacy"
"That tight-fitting scuba gear... It's a bit risqué, don't you think?"
Nah just a realist understanding from what ive read on the internet
"If they invited you, you're not breaking anything, you're sharing it."
What kind of message were you trying to send?
Do we need to dig out the old dolphin sex copypasta?
You’re still invited to a private property
" I went to Florida several months ago. I was quite happily swimming around with the dolphins when she suddenly decided to grab my foot with her genital slit. Dolphins have very muscular vaginal orifices, and can use these muscles to manipulate objects and carry them. I stayed still for a while, to see if she was just playing, but she continued to masturbate against my foot, and in the light of the torch I sometimes carry, I could see that her slit had become very pink and had swelled as well. She was aroused!

So, I started to back-paddle with my hands towards a small beached area, partially submerged in the water. A couple of times she pulled me forward into the deeper water, but eventually I got my self to the shallows. I dislodged my foot (Being careful not to pull too hard), and took her gently by a pectoral fin and rubbed her belly just to aclimatize her, I guess. She immediately rolled belly up and started doing pelvic thrusts against the palm of my hand. It was unmistakebly erotic, and by now I was fully aroused.

I stripped off my shorts, and gently pulled her into the shallows until she was lying on her side, her belly facing towards me, half submerged in the water. I nestled myself belly to belly against her, and pressed my member against her genital slit. She immediately arched her body against mine, and took me inside her body, initiating a quick series of muscular contractions with her vaginal muscles. I wrapped my left arm around her body and just held her close while she manipulated me inside her body, until I climaxed barely 2 minutes later. Surprisingly, her body also shuddered against mine, and we spent the next 5 or so minutes just lying together in the shallows, holding each other, enjoying our company and revelling in the fact that we had shared something special together, something very few people can claim to have done.

I do not brag about this though. It is not something you can brag about, since it not only is demeaning to the act, but it destroys the purpose of the act as well; to express affection, and trust. I only consent to those dolphins who ask. As a result, I have mated only three times. Each time was memorable and special, because each time it was something we both wanted to share with each other. Sex, for me, is just another, albeit powerful, expression of affection and trust. I wouldn't engage any other animal, though; it is not my attraction. But there is little I wouldn't do for a dolphin."

"Yes sorry. I phrased my statement awkwardly. 

I get why people may not use sound in certain situations, what I was more trying to say was there are some people who seem to need to be told that there even is sound in the comments. It happens all the time that people say they didn’t know there was sound. 

If I am in a situation where I can’t have things blaring I am still aware that the videos have sound.

Where the law changes to suit the individual, not the other way around. Where power and justice are back where they belong: in the hands of the people! Where every rat is free to think -- to act -- for himself! Fuck all these limp-dick lawyers and chicken-shit bureaucrats. Fuck this 24/7 Internet spew of trivia and celebrity bullshit. Fuck ""Rat pride"". Fuck the media! Fuck all of it! America is diseased. Rotten to the core. There's no saving it -- we need to pull it out by the roots. Wipe the slate clean. BURN IT DOWN! And from the ashes, a new America will be born. Evolved, but untamed! The weak will be purged, and the strongest will thrive -- free to live as they see fit, they will make America GREAT AGAIN!"

"Bro, that tire hitting a car costs more than a few hundred bucks to fix. Have you owned a vehicle?"
">How much would fixing your arm cost?

Exactly 0$ since I live in Europe"
"Especially since the damage would have been covered by the other guys insurance.  
There was no reason to be this reckless."
"Probably about $20,000 USD"
Nothing in my country.

Cars have safety equipment but that's not going to stop the wheel from going straight through the windscreen if it bounces up. If that then goes on to hit you in the head that's a lot more than a broken arm to worry about
Take my phone and play some Candy Crush
"Given that he picked up the wheel after nocking it to the ground, I would says he's fine."

"Injuries can have life long, lingering effects though. I'm not breaking any bone over a car."
"That's one hell of an inconvenience though. And while there's thankfully no cost to fixing your arm, having a broken arm could be pretty expensive. The NHS sadly doesn't pay for all the cooking, driving, and general household work you'll struggle to do with your arm in a cast; and lets hope you can work with just one arm."
"Looks more like he went to grab it and the rotation of the wheel caused his arm to be smacked downwards. Probably saved his arm too. There's videos showing rogue  wheels doing massive damage to cars.
Edit: listen closely, it still hits his vehicle"
Im not risking my r/neverbrokeabone membership
"""slapped the momentum out of the projectile"" is the most retarded goo-brain thing I've ever seen a person or whatever you are say"
"""You can fix your car for a few hundred bucks"". The tire would total the car and we would end up paying for almost a brand new one for years after this claim."
"Well here in the US of A (baby), most hospitals have free parking soooo who’s the real winner?"
"Also a valid point. I still think I wouldn't jeopardize human health over a car, but it can very easily cost way more than a few hundred dollars. I've had a few fender benders and fixing them along has sometimes cost upawards of $800, and that's just for the structural issues, nevermind the paint and dents."
Assuming the other guy even has insurance.
I'm not sure. Adrenaline is a hell of a hormone.

The following comment by /u/gifreversingbot
People always forget this. Most injuries will have some kind of long term consequences.  I got my nose broken in a fight as as a late teen and my voice forever changed for the worse and I can't breathe well through my nose. To try to fix any of that now they'd have to re-break it and fuck that.
"biggest takeaway for me. Toure right i could probably stop it, but if i break my arm or even finger that will cost way more."

"Ok I m going to share what could happen in greece. The guy with the tyre says is not his fault and they go to court. the case might resolve in 2 years. in these two year the guy with the damaged car has to pay out of his pocket to fix the car and get the money back from the insurance, also get back the money he paid for the court's fees  and for lawye he paid as well This is somewhat the case generally in europe.

I like the tilted hat
"""King Zog"" sounds like a cartoon villain"
It's said about 600 blood feuds existed against King Zog. He survived more than 55 assassination attempts.
"This is the best name ever! I mean, if I was called King Zog, I would rock a tiny mustache, too, zero fucks given 'cause I'm King Zog"
Once at a Paris bar he shot and killed his own to be assassin and after surviving he bought the whole bar drinks to celebrate. lmao
I study in same high school where he graduated in Istanbul hahaha good one **Zog Submits to Italy** **World Tension +2%**
"Say what you want, he's got style."
"""Zog was said to have regularly consumed 200 cigarettes a day, giving him a possible claim to the dubious title of the world's heaviest smoker in 1929..."""
That simply cannot be his real moustache - someone back in 1928-1939 surely must’ve photoshopped that in as a laugh
"Yeah but did he build    
     
b u n k e r s?"
Kneel before ~~Zod~~ Zog!
Looks like someone screwed up the css.
That mustasch is interesting. The time and effort it takes to keep it like that is mindblowing
"How was he the king,did he just decide he was king out of the blue in 1928?"
Useless fact: he was a insanely heavy smoker - regularly consuming 10 packs a day.
Epic. He looks like a South American dictator from back in the day.
"For those who want to know ""Zog"" means ""Bird"" in Albanian."
Just big enough to twirl.
Apparently he survived 55+ assassination attempts. Bugatti also refused to sell him a car because of his table manners.
^It's ^^so ^^^tiny
He could easily be played by Adrien Brody
He makes me think of Muskar II in Hergé's King Ottokar's Sceptre.
r/AccidentalWesAnderson
How is this the only ever king of Albania? What about  Albanian kings before the Ottoman conquest?
"And the Queen consort was the Hungarian countess **Géraldine Margit Virginia Olga Mária Apponyi de Nagy-Appony** (6 August 1915, Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary, Austria-Hungary – 22 October 2002, Tirana, Republic of Albania). She was the mother of Leka Zogu I, Crown Prince of Albania (1939-2011)."
Not the king Zog I was thinking of to be honest.
"Oh, you just wiki him.... Certified badass."
If you can call him a king after betraying Albania.
Traitor.
King Zog and His Tiny Mustache. Sounds like a GREAT title for a kid's pop-up book!
He looks like Oswald Mosley
I know him from Monty Python’s Flying Circus because he’s been mentioned in a few sketches. Good to put a face to a name finally.
You should make Skanderbeg a king post-mortem ;)
It's actually just Poirot in disguise.
"Self proclaimed king so to quote a wise man: '_Any man who must say, ""I am the King"", is no true king._'"
He looks so much like [king Muskar XII from Tintin](https://tintin.fandom.com/fr/wiki/Muskar_XII)!
i thought the real king of albania is Popek
"Context on King Zog:  
Zog was born in Albania in 1895 in a castle.

Albania became independent from the Ottoman empire in 1912.

Zog fought and sided with the Austro-Hungarian army and fought in the Alps and the Balkans(though he was a rear line soldier).

He came back to Albania after the great war and got involved in politics.

He became prime minister in 1922, later president in 1925, until he declared himself King of Albanians on the 1st of September 1928.

Apparently Zog smoked up to 200 cigarettes a day. When the Italians invaded Albania in April 1939, Zog fled to Paris and then London. When he was in his exile residence, he had a goat at home and the goat would regularly interrupt dinners with guests."
With that mustache it’s only normal that he didn’t make it that long
The mustache ist about as big as his country

Stop disrespecting the Zog
I live in Long Island on the North Shore. There's avast history of prominent people living in that area many moons ago. King Zog had a mansion built about 10 min from me in Brookville and never lived in it. The remains of the front wall are the only thing that remains and you can still climb the stairs which would have led to the main house. The house itself was destroyed by the town I believe because too many people would come to the house to look for buried treasure. The relic is absolutely freaking cool AF

Wow I was just reading about this guy cause there's ruins of his estate in NY
"In 1951 Darth Zog purchased a 260 acre Gold Coast estate in the woods of Long Island NY, allegedly with a bucket of diamonds and rubies. Intended to be his “kingdom-in-exile”, he never got the chance to move in. Rumors of hidden riches led to looters ransacking the property. Eventually falling into a state of complete decay, the mansion was torn down. All that remains are ruins in the woods- patches of pavement, a large stone staircase, and half-buried columns. http://www.scoutingny.com/stumbling-on-the-abandoned-ruins-of-king-zogs-long-island-estate/"

Isn't the tilted hat more striking than the moustache? What with it being a big no-no to wear the hat in a wrong / tilted way in official/military tradition.

So how did he die at the end?
Fidel Castro: *amateurs*
Except that zog means bird in Albanian so it isn't that cool :P
His mustache looks like birds I used to draw when i was a child.
So then maybe the tiny mustache was compensating for something?

"Dude, the Interwar Period was all about them moustaches."
"Why not? Same era as Chaplin and Hitler having similarly sized mustaches, this one is just parted a little. Probably all still fashion resulting from the need to downsize mustaches to fit in WWI gas masks."
"Only the glorious L E A D E R Enver Hoxha could have the idea to build those bunkers, since they take a really large penis to build. We can infere from this picture that Zog has a tiny mustache, very possibly because he had a MASSIVE shlong (as one probably would who survived over 55 assassination attempts. But with uncle Enver we can see that he has no mustache, which can only mean that he has Magnum Dong."
"He wasn’t communist, on the contrary! The dictator who came after him was all about the bunkers."

"Mustaches also used to be socially and politically codified in those times. Sadly I don't know the codes, I really want to know what this style was supposed to say."
"He was elected president of Albania and at some point declared Albania a Kingdom and self declared himself as king. He pretty much persecuted and killed his political opponents. 


He sold parts of the Albanian territory to the neighbors, and when Italy came to invade, he basically took all the gold of the nation Treasury and fled. He lived his life in exile. After the downfall of communism in Albania, his figure was somehow restituted, because of course the narrative is that everything that communists hated must have been good.

His grandson now calls himself prince crown and the tabloids try and follow his life in a similar fashion to the British princes, however in a much smaller scale, since the guy is utterly uninteresting; nothing much to cover other than the fact that he got married."
Yep...he wanted a kingdom and proclaimed himself king of Albania.

Before Ottoman conquest there were only Albanian Lords who had established small dominions of their own. The biggest were the Kastrioti (Skanderbeg) but he was the leader of the League of Lezhe against the Ottomans. Practically a King but not in name.
There was also a German one but he got removed almost immediately. They were the only ones in the history of the modern state though. There were plenty of others though before that: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Albanian_monarchs

"Weird thing about Albanian, though, is that it wasn't historically attested until the 1400s. And it's an isolate within Indo-European - the only others like it (isolates) being Greek and Armenian.


So no one knows where it comes from. The words for ""sea"" and ""fish"" are borrowed from other languages so it's presumably not originally from a coastal area (like modern Albania). But it's also presumably descended from an ancient language of the Balkans."

Welcome brother.
"I wouldn't necessarily outline Albanians as ""contentious"", as that modus operandi is quite dismissive and generalizing. More probable cause for your perception on the issue is the fact that Albania is less well of, historically is more prone to political instability (for various reasons), has weaker institutions, all of which compound into seeming that Albanians are somehow naturally more prone to conflict (which is, of course, nonsense).   

Truth of the matter is that Albanians don't have (nor any other SE European nation) the monopoly on savagery, no matter how hard we try to frame the argument as ""*they* are just different from *us*"", and that any nation, no matter how civilized, will produce equally horrible outcomes, given the opportunity."

I met this woman myself when I was a child and can back that up somewhat, never once saw her without a fag in her gob. There were several ashtrays in every room in the house and she kept a suitcase under the sofa filled with cartons of fags (200, 10x 20 pack).

"King Zog, Do you realize that in addition to fluoridating water, why, there are studies underway to fluoridate salt, flour, fruit juices, soup, sugar, milk, ice cream? Ice cream, Zog? Children's ice cream!...You know when fluoridation began?...1926. 1936, Zog. How does that coincide with your pre-war Commie conspiracy, huh? It's incredibly obvious, isn't it? A foreign substance is introduced into our precious, Albanian bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual, and certainly without any choice. That's the way your hard-core Commie works. I first became aware of it, Zog, during the physical act of love...Yes, a profound sense of fatigue, a feeling of emptiness followed. Luckily I-I was able to interpret these feelings correctly. Loss of essence. I can assure you it has not recurred, Zog. Women, er, women sense my power, and they seek the life essence. I do not avoid women, Zog...but I do deny them my Albanian essence."
Fuck me! He does have a resemblance. LOL
Our dictators weren't so big into this. Antonescu during WWII did something similar but he never used his decorations or moustache (he didn't had any). In a way that guy was simpler.
"Not exactly true. There were kings of Sicily and Naples who also called themselves King of Albania, starting with King Charles I. A cadet branch of his family which later ruled southern Italy and Hungary was based out of and named after the Albanian city of Durres.

The style of the 13th century founder of the house was “Charles I; King of Sicily and Albania”."
Peak German comedy.
"He became prime minister with the help of Yugoslavia. He then killed or jailed his opponents and made himself king. During his rule he did jack shit for Albania except for starting the groundwork needed to beat Malaria in Albania which was very common at the time. By the end of his rule most of the population lacked basic education and the infrastructure was non-existent.

When Italy invaded, he took all the gold of the national reserve and escaped to UK. The gold is still somewhere in the UK and will never be brought back. Even today Albania has the lowest gold reserve in Europe."
To sum it up: Literally betrayed Albanians with the help of Yugoslavia just to betray Yugoslavia with the help of Italy to betray Italy and betraying Albania again

"Where I live, there's a pretty big Albanian community. They hang out on the patio at Starbucks until like 2AM. They know how to cafe, for sure."
"It is practiced very little in some northern regions. Those regions were isolated during communism, and nobody has invested in them after communism."
"tbh the idea that the kanun is still a thing is quite disingenuous. Yes, some villagers in the isolated north might still have it, but that does not represent the average."
"According to this [report published in 2015](http://www.operazionecolomba.it/njepopullkundergjakmarrje/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016.03.04_RAPORT-I-VE%C3%87ANT%C3%8B-nr.-2.1-per-gjakmarrjen.pdf), there are 60 active cases and given the number of households in Albania ([appox. 750,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_households)), this equates to a rate of 0.008%. The Kanun is looked down upon by pretty much everyone. The only thing that is seen in a positive light from the Kanun is something called ""[Besa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besa_(Albanian_culture))"" which is a pledge of loyalty."
"What exactly is the Kanun? I looked it up on wikipedia and while I got an idea of it, I feel like I'm missing out on context or something. I'm assuming the controversial aspect is the murders?"
"Kanun is a very, very old set of customary Albanian laws practiced nowadays in very, very remote parts of Northern Albania (0.1% of the population)."
"Sorry I'm in my phone, but search for Kanuni Lek Dukagjinit. Lek Dukagjini was an Albanian nobleman of remote Northern areas during Skanderbeg's time. His laws were customary and were designed for Catholics (later Muslim converts also adopted them). The laws are not his, they came as a result of thousands of years of isolation of these people which is still existent today in the most remotr of areas. It is worth noting that parts of Northern Albania were not fully conquered by the Ottomans and even Zog himself had no authority. Kanun started to fade when Hoxha came in power, after which he violently put down blood feuds and also gave them a social stigma. For all his shit, he did a couple of things right."
Well some would say that having a low tolerance against transgression is why you're known as Prone to conflict.

"General rule:

"The Angevins did conquer Albania. They lost most of the land but ruled out of Durrës and other coastal cities for over a century.

The title is definitely just wrong. It should perhaps be amended to 'The only native king of Albania'."
"There's no documents about this. We just know he took the gold to send it to London then it disappeared. Maybe the gold was lost, maybe it reached London, we can only speculate. As for the amount, it is believed to be around 500-1000 bars, but there's no data for this either. King Zog's grandson lives a quite comfortable life though, I wonder where he gets the money haha.

From doing some research now, the current lack of gold in Albania today is also a result of another 'theft' of Albanian gold. 1600-2000 gold bars were stolen when the Nazis invaded. After WWII Albania attempted to take the gold back, but due to an incident near the shores of Saranda where a British ship hit a sea mine and sunk, Great Britain blocked the return. After numerous atempts and after being forced to pay reparations to GB for the sunken ship and to the US for the lands of it's citizens taken by Albanian communists, Albania received a USD payment less than half the value of the stolen gold ($11 000 000) but did not receive the gold."
A Zogapologist I see!
"Fight with my men. The reason communists gained so much popularity is because the leaders where actually in the frontlines. He escaped and then wanted to be reinstated. Tbh he is just as shit as Hoxha, 1920s Albania had great men, Zog wasn't onr of them."

"They are remote distant lands. Some villages can barely be reached on foot, education and infastructure are inexistent. This is however a tiny fraction of the country, I remember reading that less than 0.01% of the population still follow it. The Kanun is frowned upon today by almost everyone."
"It’s kind of remote when you live in a small country. 3 hours aways it far to me, just because i’m used to having things closer."
"That is without including villages in the mountains. Albania has a really rough terrain and is incredibly diverse in terms of dialects and customs. Even the Ottomans and Zog himself had no power over some of the Northern lands, which led a clan based life and upholed the Kanun of Lek Dukagjini as their set of laws."
"> Simply the idea that this exists in some part of the Europe today is what's crazy. Why even leave the continent to see exoctic cultures, when you have one right in front of your door. It's like they haven't evolved a bit.

It's probably unintentional on your part, but your wording here is a little dodgy.

It can be interpreted to be discriminative towards non-European people, as if being civilised is an inherently European trait that we expect of Europe, whereas outside of Europe (the ""exotic"" cultures) we expect backwardness as that if is their inherent trait."
"Lack of women's rights, blood feuds (vendetta) etc. The Kanun is compilation of tribal laws that have no place is modern society."
"It failed because communism gained a lot of popularity. Balli was collaborating with the invaders, royalists where pretty much over and Hoxha was a master propagandist. The rest were just killed."

"It has nothing to do with this, Albanian irregulars were no match for the German army. However they put an effort, unlike the others."
"Sort of. The ""th"" in ""that"" is voiced (your voicebox must vibrate to produce the sound), while the ""th"" in ""three"" is unvoiced (your voicebox must remain silent). 

It's the difference between a D and a T, B and a P, a V and an F, or a Z and an S."
Ah.  That is simply not a sound made in english.  Or at least I can't think of any word with that sound.  Certainly not world or bird (although bird is much closer.)

What does zebra milk taste like anyway.
But zebras are basically black with white stripes. And this implies they're white with black stripes. I feel decieved...
this is really cool but i have a complaint when you zoom into the lines in between each other the shade is spreading around if that’s what you call it that shadow is scuffed i guess
"Great work, really nice idea! I think it would even look more realistic, if the water level in the back leg of the front zebra was lower, given the posture of the zebra.

The leg's water level could only rise when it exceeds the zebra's hip. That's probably a small detail that will have a great effect. You could also try copying the water motion from the lake into the bodies, but maybe that's a little too much.

Amazing picture!"

"It’s great, I like it. What I would say is that it’s 2020 so far... in the USA. There’s a ton of other crappy stuff that’s really from a single sheet that’s impressive AF"
Thank God it's digital I don't want half a zebra
"Soul be some stripes on the other side?

Abeway awesome job"
How does this have 20k upvotes? It's just an altered image lol.
Are they turning water into milk?
"Now that is what I call epic artwork! Like literally as far as digital artwork goes, I have very rarely in 20+ years of being a professional Digital graphics artist ever seen such creativity and imagination! I can't stop looking at it wondering how in the world did you do it! ha ha. ;)"
So ffucking cool man! Great creative spirit.
Well done I love this so much
"Looks dope, but u should make the water mark something more subtle, kinda making the clean edit look a bit cheap"
"Great work, shit watermark. 

If we can't make the words quickly, or can't make one or two letters at all, if it distracts you from the main piece, I wouldn't say that it's a successful watermark."

How many years did it take to make this masterpiece?"

Looks so realistic. Thought it is photoshop. The blurred twig in the front looks awesome
Zebras evolved to have stripes for a reason.... i like art... but.... seems kinda... indifferent to why zebras DO NOT change color or look like this.  They are a mob and they are strong.  They litterally empathize with their pursuer and confuse him into submission.   Their behaviors require recognition of the intelligence of the animal that is hunting them.  Love zebras.
The optometrist in me says you need new glasses
The minimalist in me says that those Zebras are twice as big as they need to be.
And the black in me says that those zebras are white on black.

"The pervert in me interpreted that another way. Wait, there’s a pervert in me."
The mathematician in me says a half full zebra needs its dimensions to be approximately 80% of its original size in order for the zebra to be classified as being full.

"And the clone stamp sampling is easy to identify. Also the zebra closest to the viewer has both out of focus and in focus areas, telling me where they sampled it from and didn’t pay attention to the depth of field when they did it."
It's low level Photoshop at the most

"> The Burning of Washington was a British invasion of Washington City (D.C.), the capital of the United States, during the War of 1812. On August 24, 1814, after defeating the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, a British force led by Major General Robert Ross set fire to multiple buildings, including the White House (then called the Presidential Mansion), the Capitol building, as well as other facilities of the U.S. government. The attack was in part a retaliation for the recent American destruction of Port Dover in Upper Canada. The Burning of Washington marks the only time since the American Revolutionary War that a foreign power has captured and occupied the United States capital. -Wikipedia

He is a Filipino gay man who’s lived at that particular residence for 18 years according to the news report. She literally lives in the neighborhood. 

If this guy had been white (or rather more like her affluent white)she would have treated the situation differently, she would have treated that person like a human being instead of a child who’s doing something super naughty. And as for her vandalism claims. It was in chalk and the guy was doing it in broad daylight. 

Honestly these racist have no tact whatsoever, it’s mind boggling. There are less aggressive ways of getting the info you want like treating people with respect and dignity."
the way she acted and spoke was really cult like i dont know if anybody else has said that yet
"Her mannerisms and voice were creepy and weird. Pointing to chin, touching heart, and those eyes and voice like she was in Rosemary's Baby."
Skyrim Wood elf Karen
[removed]
I hope she sees this.
Beavis in portrait mode
Lol. Orochimaru Netflix adaptation.
I see the devils advocate movie face morph.  https://gfycat.com/TallBelatedCrossbill
Or Benedict Cumberbatch on PCP
"People keep trying to defend her for trying to ""protect"" a neighbor's property, ignoring the fact that she literally lied about knowing the owner when she was literally talking to him."
thats joo dee from ba sing se
Uncanny
"Too much Botox in her forehead, she looks bad."
The look on her face reminds me of the maid from the film ‘Get Out’.
"If this isn’t ‘shopped, she’s been mainlining the Botox"
I rarely use emojis but if I did I’d be laughing and crying at the same time. You nailed it!
Don't insult my boy Roger like that.
oh my god me too.
"Time to go bag a neematoad,"
I think people like this.
She's got more of an Ice King look to me ... But more evil.
Yo how long is that finger. Shit gotta be at least 5 inches.
Reminds me of creepy high elf women in oblivion
She looked like a missionary waiting patiently at a door in the first few frames.
Looks like the lemon dude from adventure time
"This is the same person, there is no denying that"
Her finger looks like 6 inches long
Damn long ass finger haha
hilariouss
Omg yes!!!!

This actually made me think of Lemonnnngraaaab.
Damn got the nose and the eyebrows on point lmaoooo
Her eyes creep  me out.
MR BURNS
Kaitlin Jenner
I was thinking the Wicked Witch of the West but this is more correct
***Roger Witch***
"You know that guitar riff that plays every time Roger makes an appearance on every episode of Doug?

Yeah, I heard it when I looked at this Karen."
This is too fucking accurate.
Lemongrab from Adventure Time?
"""help me, I'm not productive at all lol"
TRUTH OR DARE!
Can i know something About this ??
"Haha, I thought she looked like a Skyrim NPC"
Reminds me of the horror movie Mama
so is lisa now the Pokemon evolution of a karen?
What cartoon was this from
She's the creepiest karen ever. Her face and way of speaking made me kind of axious
Her face reminds me of an Aphex Twin album.
I didn't think they ever showed the Blair Witch in that movie.
"She was on her game for this first minute or so. She had backup, but then it all collapsed."
"Bit weird, she had a valid concern for some thing defacing property, but I guess being successful and able to own your own property is a bad thing now lol"
Looks more like a Dunmer from Oblivion
Who's this?
Orichimaru too
Joey kookamanga
I can’t stop hearing her say “personally”
When I took it in context of the meme
She simultaneously looks like both Beavis and Butt-head
"Man, that was one creepy/crazy bitch. 

Was there any updates on her?"
She reminds me of one of junji itou’s monster don’t remember wat it was called but it had a story with a group of filmmakers
Who is she?
She looks like you just activated her trap card
Benedict Cumberbatch female edition
She is the most lizard looking son of a bitch I've ever fucking seen

it look like she has 4 legs???
"She reminds me of the floating witch from Army of Darkness.

http://deadites.net/wp-content/uploads/aod_possessed_witch.jpg"
She .looks like Beavis and Butthead !!!
She looks like an Elf from Oblivion or Skyrim
Her face is in the valley of uncanniness.
you son of bich
She looks like a floating Banshee.
So you're telling me that's not Benedict Cumberbatch
"Welcome to prime time, bitch!!"
She reminded me of Rose the Hat from Doctor Sleep
Looks like a Dr Who super villain
"God, she looks like Benedict Cumberbatch"
Wheres the original post?
>:>}
Hahahahahaha!!!
That's fair
Looks like Galadriel took the One ring.
"Really looks like ""Mama"" from that movie"
"She looks like an NPC from Oblivion

r/oblivionfaces"
She reminded me of a oblivion npc
Anyone else strangely attracted to her?
Botox doesn't help everyone
Who is she? Am I uncultured?
good this woman looks pure evil
I'm getting Caitlyn Jenner vibes.
She reminds me of a masculine version of Caitlyn Jenner.
Someone come get me when she does her apology tour.
I was think more Mr Burns but this works as well
"""This is not the way to do it"""
"I thought ""polite white supremacy"" was just bullshit antiwhite vilification but this lady exemplifies it. 

I mean I thought that back in 2015 when the world was less crazy but now it seems obvious."
Trevor Wallace's mom that is
I was thinking more of those demon faces from the movie Truth Or Dare
Look at her face. What's really creepy is how happy she looks. She thinks she's caught somebody red handed she has that looks of sadistic pleasure because she thinks she can make there life harder now
She looks like she's trying to tell me that there is no war in Ba Sing Se.
"""Come to Butthead"""
This bitch looks like a demon
Isn’t she from that vid of a guy painting his own fence
Roger Klotz from Doug if anyone is interested.
She looks like the other mom from Coraline
"They sell it to me bro, mutual F"
Bruce? Is that you?
Do you get to the cloud district very often?
She looks like the dude from the Aphex Twin music video lmao
Wow thats pretty good
Butthead
>I think he is. Genuinely infuriates me
Lmfao
"She's the perfect girl for Pennywise, but would probably just scare the living shit out of him"
She reminded me a random female NPC from Oblivion.
This reminded me that we all missed?
"I didn't need the sound on for the cringe to come through, those crazy eyes were enough. She should be signed up for horror movies"
I totally saw Bruce Jenner or whatever his name is now
Nooooooo! He becomes a good guy!
"im repulsed but i cant stop looking at her, its like one of those pimple popping videos.  how fucking long is that finger ?"
That’s an insult to Roger
I don’t think I’ve ever met a Karen who was the CEO of something.... Damn
"Nah, man, that's La Llorona. She found out how to blend in."
Busybodys gonna busybody
She looks like Bruce Jenner
Why does the average redditor spend so much time on complaining about some random KaReNs appearance?
If this doesn’t cleanse her of racism.
Hunt has been out of my eyes?
Holy shit! Someone who's good with Photoshop can make a really creepy horror movie poster with that picture on the left.
Is that Conan O’Brian in the second pic?
Don’t talk shit about Roger!
she definitely just baked hansel and gretal in a pie.
invadervie's mom.
Lmao what show is that dude from again? Wow
Even her long ass finger is creepy
Who is this woman?
That's a long finger
Did the internet find her
Nah she looks like that one Spanish guy from Tik tok. “HOLA NINOOO!”
Anyone have an update on the video?
That woman and her soft voice. Thats creepy as fuck.
I blame that show for my low-self esteem
She reminds me of a co-worker who has the same mid-90s hairstyle along with a constant fake smile.
Her face will give me nightmares for weeks to come
No you’ll pay someone $3.4B.
Psycho-Karen nightmare fuel
"Girls are like donuts when I be busting Bo nuts, give em a cream filling or a layer of glaze. Im like Dougs friend Skeeter whenever I met her b/c i skeet her so hard people call her Patty Mayonnaise....

Bo Burnham turned a childhood show into something sexual and made it weird.. Yes I know that's Roger."
"Just give her bacon hair and paint her the literal color of pee and boom, you got Rodger"
I actually kind of gasped when the video panned over to her.  So unsettling.
She reminds me of yukako
I knew Karens patrolled this sub.
That finger is looooooong
Kinda looks like Caitlyn Jenner
I didnt notice before but why is her finger so damn long. She related to e.t.?
Scary long finger
Scary long finger
[Another comparison](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/AphexTwinICareBecauseYouDo.jpg)
I make this argument all the time.'
what a jerk face
Her facial expression looks like a purge mask except she ain’t wearing a mask
Roger LaFace
She looks like she’s from an anime
Satan spawn. You can see it in her face. Imagine being so vile that you're willing to lie about knowing the owners and then calling the police... how does she live with herself?
She Purges
"I've watched that video and I think it's disgusting how everyone is attacking her looks and calling her a Karen.

The guy escalated the situation and tried to get her riled up and tried to get her to call the police. Never saying it was his property, just deliberately trying to get her riled up.

A BLM supporter did this. A BLM supporter who wants cops to stop escalating situations responded with deliberate obfuscation, deliberately trying to escalate a situation into police coming.

Now we're just pointing out her looks. The karens here are the OP in the video and the people shitting on someone's looks.

She may not be a good person. May be far from it. But the video doesn't show a Karen to me, just someone being kind of a dick to her."
Having nightmares on that one.
"Thank you! She should be the mascot of this page. I feel like I have seen her before, other than the vid."
Hit me up if that happens
[Hmm...](https://imgur.com/yQyqDlo)
I could have been very happy to spend the rest of my life having never seen her face zoomed.
I...I....I...I...I...I...I...I....me
nah she hella creepier
Is this lady Benedict cumberbatchs mom ?
Thought she looked a little like aphex twin
She ain’t no Patti Mayonnaise
This woman terrifies me
Roger!!
I don't know. I see Bruce Jenner.
"also, a dead ringer for caitlin jenner"
She look like Bruce Jenner too
"Dude , he had a rough family and was a kid please don’t compare him with this monster"
I see mama from [mama](https://youtu.be/ONM0pJ52Xr0)
Roger Klotz was hilarious. Always laughing and playing pranks. He wore a mean jacket too
Is this official? Is a male Karen a Rodger? Cause I got a couple of videos of a local Rodger.
Man hands
All the better for fingering you my dear.....
And so straight
Salad fingers.
"Apparently she owns a skincare company, this whole thing is just hilarious lmao"
I bet she eats puppies
I think it's more of a woman in the painting from IT
"Her sing-song ultra-polite voice.

It's like she's an interdimensional spider in a human skin suit looking to feed."
Someone call Kate Siegel and let her know we need this Karen casted into the show as apparition number 3
[Reminds me of the purge lmao. Imagine seeing her on your door cam](https://bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Purge-franchise.jpg)
Very strong “Get Out” vibe
"All I can see is Pennywise saying ""we all float down here"""
my cunt radar went off the charts with this one.
Like a humanoid robot that still needs a lot of work seeming natural.
I want your soul
I was thinking about Windowlicker when I saw this
"This is my favorite Aphex Twin track lately - [featuring a snow monkey chilling in a hot spring](https://youtu.be/q86g1aop6a8)

Crazy face Karen needs to be more like the monkey."
My thought as well!
"She’s deleted her social media, her company’s website, and her product has been dropped by a major retailer. She’s done."
The news station reached out but didn’t get a comment back. I think she knows and is in hiding. Wait a couple days for the “apology” and how she was “misunderstood”.
[removed]
"Ooohhhhhh....it gets better...

Before she deleted Twitter, it was cached (the internet is forever that way). She's a full MAGAt....who retweets Q and Breitbart bullshit. Believes the coronavirus is fake in order to establish a new world order. Also makes fun of Greta Thunburg's face and skin. Is all in supporting not wearing masks because trump told her too. Sometimes you really have to wonder what the hell goes through a business owner's head to fill a public social media platform under your name with crazy, hateful, and racist things and not eventually get called out. Like showing the public you're a crazy racist living in San Francisco is not good PR.

Apparently birchbox has cut ties with her LaFace skin care company when her actions (both video plus her racist social media history) came to light."
I'm pretty sure that's Galadriel being tempted by the ring.
She got cancelled fast https://mobile.twitter.com/birchbox/status/1271846464268972032
She looks like she's gonna ask what the fine for necrophilia is
STOP. YOU'VE VIOLATED THE LAW!
This woman has Thetans. Big ones.
Why isnt the dude she was with getting any backlash? He did the same thing she did just way more cowardly.
"Duuuude. Last night I was pouring sauce all over the second thread that became popular with it. There were sooo damn many apologists saying the guy was a dick for not just saying he lived there right away. ""wHy DiD hE nOt JuSt SaY iT?"" Really does make me think a good amount of this site is legitimately autistic, and they don't even realize it."
If he were white she would have scoffed to herself and kept moving.
"She was trying to talk to him incredibly condescending,  extra"
"She was being condescending because she thought she was right, or believes her way of thinking would be defended by the police. So she's also very entitled."
She's vegan so condescension must come naturally
The New San Francisco accent
"Somehow that’s the face of a skincare line CEO. 

LaFace is the only skincare line for those interested in a resting bitch face that says while I can’t technically purchase you anymore, I’ll do everything I can to act like I still own you. If that doesn’t work my sheer force of entitlement will bend reality allowing me to lie, without changing my cold dead stare, to fit any narrative I want. The world is full of colored people who don’t know their place yet, but with LaFace’s new whitening cream you’ll ensure the right people know you’re better than them."
"Do you accuse me of a crime? 


Noooooo, what's your name?



What's YOUR name?



Why? We're not the one committing a crime."
the way she looked it's kind of like when you have to take a piss and you getting up to the toilet and your kind of dancing around trying to get your pants  undone before you piss yourself.  basically that was her pee pee dance except what she couldn't help from spilling out was her blatant racism. And being a buttinsky
It's like a series of rehearsed bits mashed together to make a conversation.
Skaren. They are evolving..
That’s a high elf. Altmer are the arrogant fucks.
That's the connection my brain was trying to make. Thank you!
I’m really stuck on the fact that she runs a skincare line. Who wants to take moisturizing tips from Roger Klotz?
"No, this is the actual person, direct link: https://twitter.com/jaimetoons/status/1271300265170186240?s=20"
"Fuck yeah! They doxxed the fuck out of her!

Also, I need to get into dog walking his house is huge!"
She got doxxed hard by a news channel.
Most definitely Beavis
That actually creeped me out wtf where is it from?
"IMO there's another extremely common element here people aren't even considering is that most people that go around their neighborhood asking everyone what they're doing for straight up curiosity are also annoying and self-serving. 

Like the way so many people like this behave going around their neighborhood analyzing and scrutinizing other people's business is so toxic let alone the fact this is the absolute dark-side of that behavior where their observation is immediately internalized as whatever someone *else* is doing is misbehavior. 

AND THEN the huge fact that potentially driving down property value with non-homogeneous visuals triggers the ever loving FUCK out of boomers."
Lol spot on comparison
*There are no Filipino's in Ba Sing Se*
What happened to her if I don’ mind
Check out the video it's not shopped.
Mainlining! I am dead.

"Absolutely, seeing her smile like that made me really uncomfortable... *shivers*"
She looks like she's from that Aphex Twin video Windowlicker.
tremendously so
Seriously that video screamed of mental instability.
Yo those ET fingers. Looks her whole face is a human mask.
"He’s just on TV, she crawls right out of it."
This bitch is like Roger’s mom on Purge night
Don't bring bandersnatch coverbun into this.
You meant battlefield counterstrike?
Eggs Benedict :)
She had ***Man Hands***
"The opposite of Trump hands. Yet, she's so similar."
Reminds me of that demon who comes into my room at night and sticks a long gold wire deep into my ear then breaks it off
It rubs the lotion on its skin
"She looks like my mom. After a shitty face lift, gallons of botox, and years of chemical peels they all start to look like the same shiny lizard."
"Like, taking care of skin that you've removed from people?"
It's weird that so many people have decided this looks better than some natural wrinkles
To have a skincare company and a face like this feels like a whole ironic insult
Link perchance?
Did she get any negative blow back from this? Like the other people lost jobs and were called out by the community. Do you know if she got her come upins
And children.
She definitely wears a Dalmatian jacket.
Raw
Yeeeeeeaaaah got exactly that vibe!!
"It's that ""smile politely while twisting the knife in you"" white devil vibe. Gives me the absolute creeps"
I will eat your soul
My wife does Birch Box and told me they dropped her from their subscription service.
“This isn’t who I am”
"nah, she'll be furious about how SHE'S been wronged"
She put out a tweet saying she was just trying to be a good neighbor and it was unfortunate he took it in the direction he did... before deleting her Twitter.
I love that the article is highlighted as an “Editor’s Pick” lmao
"A *skincare* company actually worked with this lady?

Edit: wait a minute ?! She owns one?! Flush all the products down the toilet !"
Because cancel culture doesn’t work. Things go back to normal once the mob moves on to the next target.
Source?
"I mean most of what she actually said wasnt particularly bad, but it was made far worse by her tone and expression/body language being incomprehensibly creepy."
Tfw no big thetan alien gf
">  ""wHy DiD hE nOt JuSt SaY iT?""

That *would* have been a good idea. He *was* (understandably) defensive. However, I have a funny feeling she would have just pivoted to another set of excuses why he shouldn't be writing on the wall. She wasn't being reasonable so there's no expectation he should be the same in such a confrontation. At least he rose above the obvious antagonism and he gets credit for that. That woman is a bitch."
[deleted]
"What's so crazy about the whole thing is that she wasn't entirely wrong in wondering if this guy was 'tagging'. But fuck, she was certainly profiling by not giving him the benefit of the doubt at first... And lying that she knew who lived there... And having the mannerisms of an extra from Get Out doesn't do any favors. She wasn't much worse than most women of that demographic though, and I would have just laughed at her and straight up told her I lived there for one thing."
You should put that on their product review page
Falmer
She’s clearly had a fuck ton of work done. No amount of skin cream gave her that absurd brow lift.
"Lmao a store that was carrying her line cut ties with her. La Face Plant

https://mobile.twitter.com/KennyKPIX/status/1272068350126915584

Also.. these people claimed *soo confidently* that this wasn’t his property because they know the people who live there. (That is actually the exact comment she is making when she has that finger on her chin in OPs picture.) 

And I actually gave them the benefit of doubt, too, when I first saw this video yesterday. I thought, “well maybe the people they knew moved suddenly and he just moved in so they didn’t know him”.

Come to learn... NOPE. This dude has been living in that house for **18 fucking years**!!!

Wtf ... Stop trying to be neighborhood watch when you don’t know shit about your neighbors!

I’m done giving people like this any room. If you can’t mind your business over fucking chalk art... I will automatically find *you* suspicious."
More like who wants to take advice from Buffalo Bill.
"If that response to the tweet is correct she's 54. She looks fucked up because of the crazy in her face and the work she probably had done, but her skin seems pretty good for a 54 year old."
Maybe that red dude Roger always hung out with idk
"At this point someone has to make a horror movie simply titled ""Karen"""
The tweet I posted is from a local news station that links to the same Twitter
Member that movie Mama?
"His only crime? Filming in vertical.

"Last night I was pouring sauce all over the second thread that became popular with it. There were sooo damn many apologists saying the guy was a dick for not just saying he lived there right away. ""wHy DiD hE nOt JuSt SaY iT?"" Really does make me think a good amount of this site is legitimately autistic, and they don't even realize it."
"I know someone who does it professionally and its way more lucrative than you'd think. Even with someone else managing the appointments and such, and taking a cut, between the walking and pet sitting (not much more work than walking, they get their walk, their food, and a little play time 2 to 3 times a day depending on the size/age/owners preferences) she makes enough to live pretty comfortably. 

If you live somewhere that doesn't have terrible traffic its pretty high reward for hours invested, and you get your daily workouts in consistently as a bonus. 

Only downside is its one of those jobs where if you arent feeling great its not so easy to just call out and getting through the day can be pretty rough."
did she for real?
In the real world it's called 'indentified' and it's not taboo like it is on Reddit.
She's obvious a witch
I'd guess devil's advocate?
Because she ate them all
An american white woman not knowing how to age with grace?
While she lies and says she knows the owner... While talking to the actual owner.
very Stepford-esque
"And why is her finger so loooong??

Eeughgh"

Excuse me what the fuck
"Or else it gets the hose again. Yes, Precious, it gets the hose."
Whats her name??
Who would've thought someone like this would double down on their behavior.
Works better than not doing shit.
"She got shit on repeatedly and lost her job during an already difficult time. At the very least it was an ego check. At most, she got introspective and realized she was part of the problem and changed her behavior/belief system. I'll take either of those over nothing happening to her and she just goes about her life being shitty"
She’s still out a job
"> incomprehensibly creepy

Mostly this. She looks like she wants to support BLM by wearing the skin of protesters."
"I am struggling to imagine how someone thinks he needed to say anything. Imagine a world where not only do we have to put up with entitlement but we have to save them from themselves to boot.
She chose to approach that situation the way she did. He didn't force her. Why is it his responsibility. She should be responsible for her own actions. A simple, ""Hey, make sure you have permission from the owner. It would be a shame if you to got in trouble. "" would have sufficed if she couldn't keep from minding someone else's business.
But, no, now we are required to rescue assholes from themselves. What a screwy timeline we live in."
"She lied and said she knew who lived there.

When Juan said, in a very surprised way, “oh you do?”, the guy she was with put his phone down because he knew she done fucked up."
"The guy she was talking to wasn’t black, I believe he was Asian"
Damm elves
18 years & he has a dog walking business. That guy probably knows more about the neighborhood than anyone else.
she deleted her skin care line instagram lol
Good comparison. Movie is scary as hell
As a mobile user nah
$525 a month! Holy shit.
Why is the copyright mark in that website for 2023?
That’s a grave disservice to the autistic community. This site is just full of ignorant assholes and edge lord kids.
Mostly I think it's just dumb teenagers.  If you to any area that is not a huge cosmopolitan city in the US the teenagers there are fucking stupid.  Between a shitty educational system and the lack of real world experience they don't have much to draw off of.
And every single one of those comments were gilded exactly once for some reason. Some idiots have a lot of cash to burn.
This is what I was referring to.  The comment I originally replied to is further down the thread so you posted the same thing at least twice.

I just realized that he was referring to the movie title and not the term. Ive had a rough day.
That person is saying that she looks like another woman.  How is that transphobic or are you just virtue signaling?
The way she suddenly stands there is also really creepy... There should be a horror sound effect when the camera pans to the side.
Isn’t the dead from the nose up a Botox thing? Looks like the Grinch’s sister.

The issue some people have is she almost killed her dog on camera while simultaneously trying to weaponize the police against a Black person because she knew she could.
">At most, she got introspective and realized she was part of the problem and changed her behavior/belief system.

I mean, here she is after nearly choking her dog to death. She hasn't learned jack shit."
"For now. She can always get a new job, and she might even get hired back at the old one.

And before you say, No way,  remember she already got a dog back that she was basically choking on camera and that she had unleashed in a park where leashes were required. The pet adoption place saw the video. They know everyone else saw the video. They still considered it best for her to have the dog."
How does one verbally express an interrobang?
"I think he is Hispanic because his last name is Juanillo, but he does look Asian so who knows. I’m Latina and have been confused with Filipina or half Asian my whole life so sometimes it’s hard to figure out."
Wow.  With only 6 clients you can rent a bedroom in a shared house.
People that have dog walkers in SF are probably making that in an afternoon
"Totes. In the first thread where I learned about it all was one dude who had a big hard on for the OP of the post, who was a direct friend of the guy in the video. Wouldn't stop, and I think he got some shills/alts to help him out a bit."

I'm glad they quoted her tweet. She was blaming him for escalating the situation like she didn't lie about knowing he didn't live there. What an asshole.
She looks like a demon wearing a skinsuit in that Twitter video. The fuck is going on there? Botox plus forced smile?
"I googled it and hope she'll be called out by the partners of the company, if it has any. Not very smart in this day and age."
Thanks didn't know she was identified.

Follow-up is in there somewhere. She did call the cops, from her car around the corner, cause she didn't even live there! They came & already knew him on good terms, gone in <5min."
That index finger tho...
"In the Twitter video from the man who was harassed by her, the recording shows the fence and a voice asks: ""Is this your property?""
The camera pans to the side, and this lady is standing very close, smiles creepily and asked again: ""Hi, I'm asking you if this your property."" The way this plays out reminded me of a horror movie, hence my comment about ""horror movie sound effect""."

Comment
"The number of ""deal breakers"" Trump supporters have accepted is quite long.

Let's start with marital infidelity.  Republicans generally lost their ever-loving minds in the 90s when Bill Clinton cheated on his wife.  Trump cheated on his first wife with his second, his second wife with his third, and his third wife with a porn star.

Trump supporters?  ""Hey, that's no big deal.""  

Can we talk about fiscal irresponsibility?  Balanced budgets?  Debt and deficit?  Trump supporters are dead silent about him running up both the deficit and the debt to record levels.

Golf.  Extravagant vacations on the taxpayers' dime.  I mean, Trump's kids are having their trips around the world paid by citizens, but when Obama was President Republicans' butt holes puckered whenever Air Force One was fueled up.

The list is so long we could spend all night on it, but let's circle back to racism for a moment.  Right wingers have continued to insist that Democrats are the ""real racists"" because some of them were once (50 years ago) part of the KKK.  Trump's dad was arrested at a KKK rally.  Not because he went overboard protesting it, but because he was part of it.  

Trump himself was going to hold a rally on Juneteenth in a city that was the site of the worst racist massacre in 20th Century US history and I'm gonna guess that most of his supporters are currently scratching their heads as to why it was moved a day later.

Please, feel free to add your own examples of blatant hypocrisy and bullshit."
"I mean I know he’s racist, but it’s only against black people Mexicans Muslims Chinese and anyone who isn’t white... but Hillary sent EMAILS you guys! I think we can ALL agree that emails are the real deal breaker. 


/s for anyone from my state who didn’t graduate 3rd grade"
[Reminds me of this](https://i.imgur.com/riQACoS.jpg)
"That makes them racist, because racism IS a deal-breaker. End of message!"
The point of a cult is that there *are* no deal breakers.
Deciding that blatant racism isn’t a deal breaker when deciding which politician best represents you... definitely makes you a racist.
"Not sure if he has a fully functional frontal lobe, but he's definitely a racist, rapist, fascist."
"What I can’t get my head around is why even the racists are voting for him.

Sure he’s racist as shit but has he actually done anything about it?

Are there less Mexicans or Blacks in America? Did he ever build the wall to keep everyone out?

Not only is he a racist but he’s an incompetent racist. Possibly the most powerful man in the world and yet he feels the need to hide from his own people holding scraps of cardboard over their heads."
Not all Trump supporters are racists. But all racists are Trump supporters
"Remember when Howard Dean dropped from saying ""yahhh!""?"
"If you have 10 people comfortably sharing company with one nat-c, you have 11 nat-cs

The fact is that even the alledged ""non racist"" traitors are happy to march shoulder to shoulder with the openly racist ones.

It is capitulation via cowardice. The tool of settler culture. They can deny being racist, but they will never take action to stop it."
"Not all trump supporters are neo-nazis, but all neo-nazis are trump supporters."
"I swear man. Every time I hear my parents say something racist, they always preface it with ""I am not racist but"" 

Its like they are about to say the most racist shit after they preface something with that."
Man says totally contradictory things a day apart and the cult supports it all.
"Gop primary voters had 16 people who aren't as overtly racist as trump (cruz rubio etc) and would've done their conservative agenda, yet trump became the nominee. Racism was the feature not the bug."
"“it’s not enough to be not racist, you have to be anti-racist” - Andrew Schulz"
"""Just because racists love Trump more than any President in modern history, doesnt mean he's racist. He's just really good at appealing to racists with his actions and his words.""

Trump supporters are clown putting on makeup memes come to life."
Not all Trump supporters are racist... but all racists are Trump supporters
"Many police unions and most police officers support, endorse, and vote for Donald Trump. So if the police are unable to identify or condemn the racism conducted by the president they vote for, then how the hell can the police identify or condemn racism conducted by their colleagues or themselves? And they wonder why the world is protesting against them."
"For some people, sexual assault isn't a deal breaker either"
Yep. That nails it.
All trash to me. Had every opportunity in the world to redeem yourselves. Suffer.
"In my opinion if you support a racist you are a racist. No way around that.

&#x200B;

In Germany we have a ton of people voting for the most racist party that isn't straight up illegal just because just out of spite for the bigger parties and not because they actually support them, at least they say that if asked.

But all of them are just as much racists and nazis as that whole party"

"I don't think it needs to be pointed out that not all Trump supporters know he's a racist. A good number of them, including some of the ones who are unknowingly racists themselves, are against racism. Some people are incredibly ignorant and don't understand what racism looks like, be it from another person or in their own actions. 

To me the most frustrating ones are the ones who *don't want to think* that Trump is a racist or that they are acting in racist ways- they don't want to spoil their beloved misperceptions, and prefer delusion to disgust. 

Yes, all these people still support a racist, but not knowingly. They aren't guilty exactly as this image would suggest they are, because they weren't knowingly negligent or knowingly voting for a racist, and they still haven't figured it out for unknown reasons (maybe all they watch is Hannity!). 

I know it's a joke but it's not helpful to assert that right wing voters ""know"" Trump's a racist, without having evidence to support that claim. That message demonizes right wing voters unfairly just like Fox News demonizes the left unfairly every day. It closes off conversation and is stooping to their level."
"No, all Trump supporters are racists.  You can't dodge that bullet.  Everyone knew what he was, and anyone who voted for him supports his ideals."
I would say that makes them racist.
"As a child, my mom drilled the concept of “you are who you associate with” into us kids. I guess Trump supporters never got this lesson."
Any government you had in would be racist. Its actually about money. Money causes racism. It is for your governments and their close friends benefit.
"Racism is an ideology and not blatantly and clearly stated like an amendment. Meanwhile they’ve condemned constitutional right (against protests), praised infringement of basic constitutional right (NG and police attacking peaceful protestors and press), and overall give no fucks about anything unless it serves them.

The fact these people don’t grasp constitutional rights it’s not shocking they don’t grasp ideology."
This is clearly discrimination *against* lizard people.
"They *know* they have Neo-Nazis and violent white supremacists all up in their Party. They never denounce them (neither does the President)). They just accept it as part of the decor. 

Meanwhile they make up Antifa bullshit, when the FBI said they aren't a threat, and not a single Antifa person was found during the recent riots. Man of those arrested were Right Wing white nationalists trying to start trouble."
These people have made their deal with the devil and the price of their soul was pretty cheap.
"Racism, misogyny, philandering, gritting..."
Not all republicans are racist but all racist are republicans.
Trump treats the Constitution like he does women.
"""Racism is not a deal breaker""

   - A Racist"
...which means they're all racist
When he almost took their vape away.
"As my parents, my grandparents, and the rest of my family says, he's not a racist. They should shut up with that rush Limbaugh BS and get a foot in reality."
That describes the GOP in general
"All Republicans aren't Nazis, but all Nazis are Republican."
"Also, they're all racist"
"Dammit, not all Trump supporters are racist!

It just so happens that all racists support Trump. !/s"
And of course Trump is *undeniably* racist since he said that some good people may have been at the Charlottesville protest three years ago.
So they are racist
"The thing is they usually just deny that he's racist, rather than own up to the fact that he is and explain why they are willing to let it slide. These are people who literally just say that anything that isnt flattering to Trump is fake. How the fuck do you have a conversation with someone who will simply refuse to believe anything you say on the basis that they dont like it and if they dont like it then it's fake news? You can't talk to someone who has catapulted themselves out of reality."
"Dude. No. Only common denominator among all trump supporters is the racism.

Everything else is... they just don't give a shit"
"Racism is a serious character flaw.  You should point out racism where it happens.

Someone racist spewing hate?  That's terrible, and you should point out what an idiot they are.  Does their job let them spread their message like that?  Maybe they shouldn't have that job.

Deplatform them entirely?  That goes against the 1st Amendment, and getting rid of that might result in your being censored too, but I can understand where you're coming from.

Get them fired from their manufacturing job?  Maybe that's a bit much.  Even felons out of jail deserve better than that.  Harass their spouses/children family?  Threaten them where they live?  Now you're the one being horrible.  Two wrongs don't make a right, and you're spewing hate yourself.

Now, you claim all white people are racist.  Let's suppose that's true, or nearly true.  Now we have a bunch of white people, not being outwardly hateful but still racist, watching you harass other white people for speaking their minds.  What will they do?  Well, they won't speak their minds, but they also won't like what you're doing.  And they still vote.

And this is how Trump won the election, and how he's going to win the next one."
I would argue that not being anti-racism falls under the umbrella of being racist.
Ask any proud and out racist who they support and it’s always Trump. That’s all you need to know. If Trump supporters want us to recognize crazy people on the left then they need to come to terms with the fact that all their crazies are terrible racists while the lefts are always accused of being too accepting of everything. I personally rather be on the accepting side even though I think they go to far sometimes.
that just sounds like racism with extra steps
"Racism is a spectrum! Think about it like this! One side is anti-racist, the other is racist. If you say “I am not a racist” that puts you at 0 on this spectrum... right in between the two."
"I’m really not a Trump guy, but if you watch any conservative talk shows, they deny he’s racist and point to his policies regarding black communities, I don’t know the exact details of the argument, but my point is that they don’t accept the argument that he’s racist."
How can you tell me that a man who was ordered by the courts to rent to POC could possibly be racist?
“We are against slavery and racial injustice” but we have no problem consuming products from countries that still follow these practices. All the big brands we love to support. So by proxy we still prop up slavery while pretending to denounce it.
I wish we got more options than two presidents. Hopefully then one of them would be passable.
I don't see what trump has done during his presidency that makes him racist .
No. They actually are all racist.
Something something 10 Nazis at a table
"I bet Trump being unable to hold a glass of water or unable to walk down a low decline ramp will cost him more supporters than his racism has. 

The people who support Trump see the racism as a feature, not a bug."
What is this? a parody of baby shark?
Grab a married bitch's pussy? You must be a Christian!
"All Trump supporters are racists but not all racists are Trump supporters.

Rebupicunts and The Trump Cult have no fiscal policy. Neither do they have any moral or ethics they stand by other than none.

You don't support Trump for his politics rather than the lack of them. All Trump got for you to support is unhinged racism and every sin in the bible."
Fair enough. IMO trying to get rid of racism is like trying to get rid of the gay - about the most that will happen will be shaming it into the closet.
Fuuuuuuccccckkkkkkk
If we had a king.
That implies that the first wave is over
"""You don't have to be a racist to support Trump, but you have to be okay with him being a racist, and at some point that becomes the same thing.""

- someone I can't remember"
"Thinking back on many of the criminal justice laws and acts which negatively affect blacks people, many of them were put into place by democrats (Clinton), or had strong bi partisan support.  If you think Trump is the principal enemy of what’s happening, this country has no hope."
depends on how racist he is and how much action he takes in that direction whether or not it is a dealbreaker
"**Sorts by controversial**

Someone gimme some popcorn."

Tough to find a candidate to support. Biden has many deal breakers too. So I think it's third party in 2020.
How quickly would this recent dissent be brushed under a rug if we were still living under Obama? Or Biden? Prepare to be gaslit about how magical everything is. And prepare for a worse version of Trump.
But Trump said he doesn’t have a racist bone in his body sooooo...
Here's a crazy thought.  Being OK with racism is racist.
I looked it up; it's dildos.
How does this qualify as humor?
To me that's one and the same
"Disagree: if racism is not a deal breaker, you are racist. Same is true for homophobia,  transphobia and misogyny."
If you get off of this site and talk to every day people regardless of political association you will know this picture is false.
Not sure this is actually the case. What they do is believe he's not racist; they insist on it.
"So saying ""They are not racists but they're really racist!""

Yeah.  No.

This is the same thinking and sentence structure of ""When did you stop beating your wife?"""
"If you don't stand for something you will fall for anything

Trump followers are so dumb.  That Bible walk was soo cringe.  Cheesy as hell.  I wonder who approved that stunt :D"
r/liberalgunowners would like a word...
I was saying this to people right after Trump got elected. They didn't actually think he would you know do any of the things he actually said he would.
"I am not defending that he, like everybody else, have no discriminatory stereotype that they don’t like it... and if you think you are better than him, just look  at this same post, because you are judging all Trump supporters as racist compliant even though you don’t know all these people... the majority of Trump supports are normal people like you and all the other by law citizens of this great country...
A wise guy said: “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.”"

"I still dont understand how christians can support a guy who breaks at least one commandment on a daily basis. I think its because they believe in god about as much as he does. Its all just pretend. If they really believed, if they really thought there was a hell, they wouldnt support him."
"Biden is a racist piece of trash, so this hypocrisy runs both ways"
Political humor? Wheres the humor?
"It’s more : democrats decided to accuse trump supporter of racism as a strawman and use false adequacy to justify their preconceived belief system.

4-“but your president is a rapist”, (im not American, Justin Trudeau wore a black face and I haven’t voted for him). 


If you have any original insults (you won’t have any argument), please feel free to share it."
"I don't know why I bother on reddit, but I have to ask. Does anyone have any evidence, that's not anecdotal or debunked that Trump is actually a racist? Just because CNN wants you to believe he is, doesn't mean it's true."
I know a few.. in my experience they are in deep denial that he is racist and supports racism
Each side is going to call the other a cult.
"I do remember another presidential candidate saying something pretty racist something along the lines of

“if you vote trump you an’t black”

Gladly let you argue many other things about how bad trump but good ol joe is also pretty racist."
Or...or...hear me out... they decided that the things you think are racism aren’t.
"I mean, I don’t think that Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton were the best candidates, but because Trump is Republican, a majority of his political views align with mine, so he would be a better pick for me. I’m pro life, and because Trump took action that supported that movement. I don’t recall one policy that Trump put in place that was racist."
"Trump supporters:

> What about abortion."
Not all people who voted for Trump are racist. But all racists voted for Trump.
Trump isnt racist? The democratic party is. They want to own all minorities to do their bidding. Wake up sheeple
"""if you don't know whether to vote for me or Trump, then you ain't black"""
Denying racism make you racist.
"Was there an option to vote for someone who *wasn't* racist?

Y'all are pretending that Hillary wasn't Hillary fucking Clinton who called black people ""super predators"" and wanted to ""bring them to heel."""
If you agree with what Trump is saying on questions more important to you then it is not a deal breaker.
The amount of TDS on this thread is tooooo daaamn hiiigh!
Still waiting on trump to do/say something racist. You can’t just slander someone’s name because you don’t like them
"Ooh, that's a good name for a book about this disaster: The Art of the Deal-breaker."
If we had a king.
"This sub is called political HUMOR idiot.  While the message may be true, it isn’t funny in the slightest."
No they are all racist the minute they voted for him.
The same is true for “explosive diarrhea”
"This isn’t humor in the slightest. 


But I’ll be damned if this isn’t the greatest take I’ve heard. 


I’ve tried to give trump supporters the benefit of the doubt for years, because my dad, whom I respect more than anyone in the world, is one. He’s a great person. Social, kind, frequently gives to charity, mentors inner city kids, etc. I’ve always strived to be more like him. 


But he always turned a blind eye to Trump, mostly because of the booming economy. My dad isn’t racist in the *slightest*, but shit if this isn’t an excellent point. Silence is violence. Took me way too long to realize that."
I voted for trump because I knew he'd shine a giant spotlight on everything wrong with America. You want to know your enemy.
Same goes for abuser of women.
"Someone, please tell me how Trump is in any way definitively racist. I’ll wait."
Most of them have decided it doesn't exist as far as I can tell
That’s a lot of Grand Wizards after all
"Not true. Some of them are in denial that racism exists in their cult entirely and that it's just the Democrats and the media brainwashing us to believe it.

I laughed too."
"I hope y'all know you have many many MANY valid points, but if you don't effectively communicate with Trump's base, they won't listen. Be very careful with tone and intent. I have seen many cases of someone using facts in a condescending manner to insult the Trump supporter for voting for him. Ego kicked in as you could suspect of a human on the ropes and it went nowhere. I have also seen someone speak to a Trump supporter with calm, respect, and a non-gotcha manner. The man guided this Trump supporter through. The Trump supporter came to the conclusion that they support certain policy and didn't see Hillary/Joe implimenting them so he hoped Trump would impliment these policies. He realized Trump wasn't a good candidate for office anymore and he needed to vote for someone else on the right-of-center."
Where’s the humour?
So all trump supporters are racists.
Pretty much all trump supporters are people who are too far hung in the past and have their head shoved up their ass thinking USA is the shit
"I'm sorry but, supporting racism makes you a racist. It's that simple no matter what you try to tell yourself to try to excuse it."
"My wife's stepmom: ""I don't see him as racist."""
Donald trump was determined a racist in 2016 by not being a democrat
Was it racist when Obama politicized the death of a black kid by saying he could have been his son?
Bet this guy votes for Biden
Oh fuck that’s a pretty weak take
"This is why I didn’t vote in the last election and very likely won’t in this one. All the candidates are shit, and I refuse to have to choose the lesser of two evils."
What really gets me is how some women can be okay with tolerating what he's said about them in general.
"As an outsider it's the blind hypocrisy that gets me with American politics, as if voting for Biden means you enjoy inappropriatly touching young girls. There's zero tolerance for rational and entertaining the thought of an opposing opinion."
"Oh, I just realized what you meant by birtherism. If you're referring to Obama, then Trump is a moron. Obama was born in Hawaii. I don't know if it's racist to request a both certificate. I wouldn't think it is, if Obama asked Trump for one. Stupid? Absolutely. Do I think Obama has family in Kenya? Yeah. That's actually fairly well documented, but Obama wasn't born there."
"I may be a little naive, but when Trump said good people on both sides, I'll take him at his word that he meant the people who weren't there for Unite the Right, they were protesting taking down statues only.  BUT you can't be righteous if you stand shoulder to shoulder with them because they want what I want."
Where's the humor? Is it supposed to be funny?
"Biden to a black man: ""Well I tell you what, If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.""


What a racist thing to say by segregationist Biden 


Guess that would make everyone supporting Biden a racist..."
The reddit cult speaks!
All democrats decided imperialism isn't a deal breaker
"Not all Dem sniff little girls, but they all decided to vote on Biden to lead the party.  Own it."
"Idk if Trump is racist, I think he’s an opportunist.  

At least 90% of the people voted in, lean into “law and order” or “tough on crime.”  Nixon coined it right after the civil rights movement and began the war on drugs.

Reagan then gave the War on Drugs, viagra.  But instead of the symptoms lasting 4 hours, it’s lasted 40 years.  Add in Clinton (corrected to H.W Bush) with Mandatory minimums and you have essentially created a machine to target poor people that take plea deals, and end up in prison for years for petty crime.

Drugs target the poorest of us, and in combination with racial red-lining, the police target minority neighborhoods even though drugs is common through all demographics.

Thanks to not allowing felons to vote, After decades of people going into prison for petty drug charges, you have millions of people in targeted demographics that cannot vote.

So if you’re in power, what do you do?

You say you’re gonna be tough on crime, because middle class folk run to that banner like it’s an Orange Julius stand.  So now you basically just wrap yourself in the law and order blanket, and cover a large percentage of voters.  The more you deplete the other demographics with prison time, the less their vote matters.

Trump is now targeting Latinos and Muslims with being criminals, just like African Americans have been for decades now.  If they can start moving the public’s and police perception toward these people being criminals, all the sudden the machine starts up again.  They wind up in prison on bullshit charges.  Then they can’t vote.  

No one cares about the prison population until they’re inside it.  So, if your GOP/DNC/ALT RIGHT/ETC, why wouldn’t you want a voter base that’s easier to manipulate?  Easier to herd, and to maintain support.  Elections are easier if you only need to worry about a few special interests instead of many.  

Now you may argue, the mere act of targeting these people is racist, and I would agree.  I wouldn’t disagree that this is racism, But if Trump and the government is doing this to Mexicans, Muslims, Natives, etc, for nefarious reasons to manipulate the voting turnout, I think that’s something much worse.

Edit: thanks for the responses, for the record I agree that what he’s doing is absolutely racist, and unforgivable.  The purpose of my argument with this post and across my many comments (sorry) is not to argue whether he’s truly racist, but how he’s dividing the country through race.  But isn’t that the definition of racism?  Yea lol.  

If there is anything I’d like to highlight though, it’s that we should have oppressive oversight with what Trump is doing in terms of manipulation.  

I’m done responding though, I yelled at a dude and that’s usually my sign to shut the hell up.  Downvoting and all, it’s just nice to have open discussion."
"Don't get to pretend the other people are racists when your little darlings in CHAZ booed the women from the African American Community Advisory Council for having the audacity to call out the ultra white liberal LARPers for hijacking the BLM movement's message.

Sorry but Malcom X had the right fucking idea.  

 Malcolm X said: “The worst enemy that the Negro have is this white man  that runs around here drooling at the mouth professing to love Negros  and calling himself a liberal, and it is following these white liberals  that has perpetuated problems that Negros have. If the Negro wasn’t  taken, tricked or deceived by the white liberal, then Negros would get  together and solve our own problems. I only cite these things to show  you that in America, the history of the white liberal has been nothing  but a series of trickery designed to make Negros think that the white  liberal was going to solve our problems. Our problems will never be  solved by the white man.”"

JFC if republicans didn't have lies and double standards they wouldn't have standards at all. Religion is their guiding light (except that shit about helping the poor). They're the party of law and order (except when ""very fine people"" just ""made a mistake"" or were ""troubled""). They're all for small government (except for trying to dictate marriage/abortions). They're all about freedom of speech and assembly (unless it's minorities protesting being killed by police). They want a literal interpretation of the Constitution (except that bit about a well-regulated militia). They're the party of Lincoln (except oddly enough their supporters waive more confederate flags than Union ones). They care about family values (except their false idol is the antithesis of that). They're pro-life (until the baby is born; the living can get fucked). Spending is a huge issue (unless the president is an R and Boeing needs new contracts). They care about strength and professionalism (except trump is the weakest most vile POS out there). They love to support the troops (except the ones who come back with disabilities and/or mental illness. Can't disrupt the propaganda machine!). Vote by mail can't be trusted (except when the god-emperor and his family do it).

This is just the crap I rattled off at 3am while I'm half asleep. Sorry for any typos because of that. Anyone else can feel free to add to the list too."

"I wish I could freaking copy+paste your comment and email it to every trump supporter I know. But of course, they’d just do more mental gymnastics to justify it somehow."
"None of those things have happened in MAGA world. The economy is flourishing and he's a religious family man and he isn't racist because they use their own special numbers and their own special quotes and their own special stories to replace anything that isn't flattering to Trump. Didn't one of his early staff members literally admit this? The whole ""alternative facts"" thing? But I'm sure MAGAs have doctored that quote into something conscionable in their heads too."
Trump supports aren't silent about his fiscal irresponsibility. They are straight up in denial. They legit think he has done wonders for the economy

I feel like you throw a dart at this list and if a Democrat did any one of these Republicans would be in the streets rioting for them to be removed from office."
"You have most of this right. A few corrections from my personal experience:

- The infidelity is not “no big deal” it’s actually **good** to them because it means he’s strong. I’m literally not joking; I’ve heard them speak in **favor** of the infidelity because it shows strength. He doesn’t care about the rules, which is cool to them. But if Hillary Clinton doesn’t follow the rules, put her in jail.

- Lol who cares about debt and deficit, the economy is killing it right now which outweighs all of the bad stuff. Obama (and Bush II) used debt to pull us out of a recession, which they claim was illegal. trump uses debt to throw money at rich people and somehow that’s ok.

- trump earned his right to golf because he has done more than any other president. His vacations aren’t expensive compared to how much he’s doing for us (see again: nonsense about the economy). He makes up for it so no big deal.

- How can the “party of Lincoln” be racist? “We freed the slaves!” But also “don’t touch our confederate flags because that’s our heritage”.

The cognitive dissonance is so far beyond what I thought these people were capable of 5 years ago. I thought the trump primary was something they would look back on with embarrassment because he had gotten so close to the nomination. I laughed at my dad when he said he would vote for trump because it was so absurd I couldn’t see the racist underbelly. I watched polls showing a Clinton landslide and was convinced we as a country wouldn’t let trump win. 

Most of what I though I knew about conservatives in this country was wrong, at least as far as the lengths they would go to to defend their hypocrisy rather than just admit they were wrong. I wasn’t ready for 4 years of trump and I’m even less ready for 4 more. Who knows how long the Supreme Court will have a conservative majority if he wins again. It may be that way beyond the end of my life and that’s terrifying.

**PLEASE VOTE THE MOTHERFUCKER OUT**"
"> Trump's dad was arrested at a KKK rally. Not because he went overboard protesting it, but because he was part of it. 

this is mostly false. just trying to be accurate. I wouldn't repost that. It's misleading."
This is fantastic.
"> Trump himself was going to hold a rally on Juneteenth in a city that was the site of the worst racist massacre in 20th Century US history

That word is ""Nazi."" Nobody cares about their motives anymore.

They joined what they joined. They lent their support and their moral approval. And, in so doing, they bound themselves to everything that came after. Who cares any more what particular knot they used in the binding?

"Dear lord, right wing voters demonize themselves pretty consistently. It's like when you ask a conservative if they'd be okay with paying more in taxes to provide healthcare for everyone. They say no. They in fact don't want to pay more in taxes so children that have cancer can get treatment without their family being bankrupt. They don't support a universal basic income that would provide a safety net for our most vulnerable citizens. They have no sense of civic duty nor any desires past themselves. They habitually ignore factual information in favor of biased right wing media outlets that do little reporting of facts and tout opinion, while refusing to see they're being duped and voting against their own self interest. They are cowed by a hysterical media that has been shamelessly brain washing a portion of the country and being hypocritical for decades. Conservatives rail about democrats having no patience for their opinions about things but it's because basic tenants of their political beliefs can't be justified. They're just fucking air headed cunts."

"You’re referring to implicate bias. When we are unaware of our negative thoughts because those thoughts are submerged into our subconscious. People like this are the most disturbing because like you said, they cannot see the racist actions nor bigotry, nor sexist beliefs Trump has expressed. These are the type of people who for example may look at a African-American man that lives next door to them an say to themselves “he’s nice because he is a (insert decent career) not like most African-Americans that are (lazy, criminal, etc). They truly believe because they may not explicitly treat a person of color in a racist way, that they themselves are not racist. These people probably believe that because they are friendly with people of color that, that fact means they are not racist, but if they were ever put into a social situation for example where let’s say a black man is having a loud argument with his wife. They would call the cops because in their eyes “he’s scary and probably violent.” Whereas if they came across a white couple doing the same thing they would probably take the stance that “sometimes couples fight.” An my personal favorite when a black victim of a violent crime committed by a white person (either LEO or civilian) they look for reasons as to why the black victim deserved this, rather than asking did the perpetrator do this because of anger and hate based on race? (Just world believes) are a psychological concept that help people with implicit racist bias, shift blame onto victims of heinous crimes because it’s easier to say, the black kid was a thug, he tried weed once, then to accept that the man who killed him was racist. It’s easier to say she deserved to be raped because she dressed that way and got drunk at that party, then to say the white kid that is a star athlete for the college is a bad person that thinks it’s ok to violate an unconscious woman. This list can go on, but hopefully you get the idea."
"Thank you! It’s just not a two-dimensional issue. If you want to get the people of the U.S. to support the cause, you can’t demonize half them—that turns people away. All that screaming at somebody and calling them a racist does is make them turn their back.

My old youth pastor is a Trump supporter (as disgusting as I think Trump is), yet he’s ministered in the Bahamas where the vast amount of the population is black. As misguided as I think his politics may be, he loves people regardless of their skin, and he makes it obvious. To call him a racist would be insulting and a slap to his face. He probably has some biases deep inside which are worth evaluating, but screaming at him and calling him a bigot won’t fix that."
"This. Asserting that folks are racist, or accepting of racism, aggressively the way this post does is a sure fire way to guarantee that person is not going to listen to any education about implicit bias, microaggressions etc, to better understand racism in general. - which is exactly what they need in order to recognize that trump is racist."

"I feel like that's leaving out a very large portion of the quote, leaving it without context. Don't know why you'd do that."
"*I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.” Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.*

You present this quote like Malcolm X wishes black people would vote conservative. Damn if it ain't the opposite LOL. This quote is basically criticizing the idea of the lesser of two evils.

> Bruce Riedel, a former intelligence analyst who conducted Obama’s initial review on the Afghanistan war, says: “I think one of the surprises for Gates and the military was, here they come in expecting a very left-of-center administration, and they discover that they have a secretary of state who’s a little bit right of them on these issues — a little more eager than they are, to a certain extent. Particularly on Afghanistan, where I think Gates knew more had to be done, knew more troops needed to be sent in, but had a lot of doubts about whether it would work.”

"""Accept"" is vague there. Accepting the existence of 'race' as a reality socially (even knowing that it's unscientific and arbitrary) isn't the same thing as ideological racism. It varies by author/dictionary, but we were taught this difference - ""racialism"" vs. ""racism"". But I've been out of school for a long while now, so, grain of salt, I guess."
"Or you know, acknowledging that there are divides (often created by racist views/people) and wanting those divides to not be there is not the same as actively fighting to exclude or mistreat a certain part of the population and you know it."

"How is using racial statistics the same as a synopsis?  When did I claim this was my own research?  I already mentioned watching the documentary in this thread.  But the 13th is not about the nefarious intentions of Donald Trump, it’s about shining a light on the injustices of African Americans.  Did I mention Alec?  Did I mention prison labor?  That’s because I’m not quoting a documentary verbatim. I’m referencing statistics used during to support my argument about controlling the “black vote”

Or is your argument is that if a documentary uses data to support its claims, that information is blacklisted?  Or should I make my arguments with “my feelings” or “fake news” instead?  If information becomes public can no one use it?"
Explain yourself
"Do you see me defending him?  Im calling the bitch out!  Am I portraying this activity as good?  I literally called it nefarious, and yet you somehow decide to shove your head into your ass, plug your ears and decide to speak.  Where the fuck do you get off?  Do you know how to read?  How in the fuck are you that dense?  Read what I fucking say."
"Again, I’m not disagreeing or trying disprove it.  I’m just arguing the nefarious angle.  But yea, that absolutely supports that he’s a racist piece of shit.

Regardless of what’s swimming through his mind, I’m violently against him."

**The White Liberal**

*“The white liberal is  the worst enemy to America, and the worst enemy to the black man. Let me  explain what I mean by the white liberal. In America there is no such  thing as Democrat or Republican anymore. In America you have liberals  and conservatives. The only people living in the past who think in terms  of I’m a Democrat or Republican, is the American Negro.*

*He’s  the one that runs around bragging about party affiliation. He’s the one  that sticks to the Democrat or sticks to the Republican. But white  people are divided into two groups, liberals and conservative. The  Democrats who are conservative, vote with the Republicans who are  conservative. The Democrats who are liberal vote with the Republicans  that are liberal. The white liberal aren’t white people who are for  independence, who are moral and ethical in their thinking. They are just  a faction of white people that are jockeying for power. The same as the  white conservative is a faction of white people that are jockeying for  power.*

*They are fighting each other for power and  prestige, and the one that is the football in the game is the Negro, 20  million black people. A political football, a political pawn, an  economic football, and economic pawn. A social football, a social pawn.  The liberal elements of whites are those who have perfected the art of  selling themselves to the Negro as a friend of the Negro. Getting  sympathy of the Negro, getting the allegiance of the Negro, and getting  the mind of the Negro.*

*Then the Negro sides with the  white liberal, and the white liberal use the Negro against the white  conservative. So that anything that the Negro does is never for his own  good, never for his own advancement, never for his own progress, he’s  only a pawn in the hands of the white liberal.*

*The worst  enemy that the Negro have is this white man that runs around here  drooling at the mouth professing to love Negros, and calling himself a  liberal, and it is following these white liberals that has perpetuated  problems that Negros have. If the Negro wasn’t taken, tricked, or  deceived by the white liberal then Negros would get together and solve  our own problems. I only cite these things to show you that in America  the history of the white liberal has been nothing but a series of  trickery designed to make Negros think that the white liberal was going  to solve our problems.*

*Our problems will never be solved  by the white man. The only way that our problem will be solved is when  the black man wakes up, clean himself up, stand on his own feet and stop  begging the white man, and take immediate steps to do for ourselves the  things that we have been waiting on the white man to do for us.*

*Once  we do for self then we will be able to solve our own problems’ ""The  white conservatives aren't friends of the Negro either, but they at  least don't try to hide it. They are like wolves; they show their teeth  in a snarl that keeps the Negro always aware of where he stands with  them. But the white liberals are foxes, who also show their teeth to the  Negro but pretend that they are smiling. The white liberals are more  dangerous than the conservatives; they lure the Negro, and as the Negro  runs from the growling wolf, he flees into the open jaws of the  ""smiling"" fox. One is the wolf, the other is a fox. No matter what,  they’ll both eat you*.”"
It's the Nixon rule: It's not illegal if the President does it.

Weren't his three main platforms to repeal Obamacare, build a wall and lock up crooked Hillary?

He couldn't even repeal Obamacare with Republican control of Whitehouse, Senate and Congress."
"so in the future, here is what I did. I'm not a trump supporter by any means. So when I read your comment, I just highlighted your ""trumps dad got arrested at a KKK rally"" comment and right clicked on it. search in google. then bam. a ton of links to research and read.  I think we have to be diligent not to post bullshit because they call us out on it and discount your whole message. 

the truth seems to be that at 22 years old Trump was there, got arrested, but it's not clear why or what for because it was a clash type rally where the blacks and whites where counter protesting. 

I think it's probable that he was there to support white power. sure. but this doesn't confirm he was a KKK member either. snopes and politifact have pages on it."
all by design
"Actually, Trump votes by mail. Oops"
"The term “lesser evil” is such crap. Like every single one of Hillary’s policies wasn’t objectively better for our country and the world on every level.

I don’t have to agree with or approve of every platform and policy she ran under to know she would have done her very best for our country, the people, and the world.

So many people who voted emotionally because the GOP has waged a constant PR war against her since 1992."
"Trump was the ""fuck this, I'm not playing any more \*flips the table\*"" vote for many. Hillary was the embodiment of everything wrong in American politics since  Reagan. 2016 was a referendum on ""do we like where America is going"" and people voted no.

If the DNC had learned from it's mistakes and undergone meaningful reform it would be a shoe in for 2020 but sadly the only thing they seem to have taken away from it is that Hillary hadn't raped enough people. Trump has already won 2020, the DNC knows it."

You don’t have to wearing a KKK hood to be racist. These things are all racist. Every single one of them. It is not up for debate. They are racist.

"This doesn't age well in 2020. I'm sure it was very insightful when it was made, but it doesn't take much observation to see that in our current political climate this simply doesn't align with reality.Our most vulnerable populations stand to gain the most from contemporary liberal policies. I'm sure liberals looked very different back then, and he was very reasonably jaded by the politics of his time, but this simply doesn't make since in the context of the here and now."
"Thats it,and we all know Nixon wouldn't lie about that. All the Republicans, except Romney, know Trump is their boy."

"Wasn’t my comment, but I wouldn’t say it’s misleading to say he was arrested with a bunch of KKK members while attending a KKK rally, because he was. But you’re right: no confirmation that he was in the KKK. Just that he was arrested with multiple KKK members at a KKK rally. 

I understand that you can’t fully confirm that he was in the KKK. No one can. I’m also sure that he never publicly stated that he was protesting for black rights, and his son, after following his advice, was also sued for discrimination against black people trying to rent housing from him. And lost. Because the United States government found him to be a bigot. 

But we’ll never know for sure what Fred Trump was doing there."
And he used the White House as his home address while voting in Florida. That's election fraud and it's a crime.
"Eh, I honestly believed the Biden rape allegation when I first heard his accuser, but the fact her story has evolved, and is contradicted by herself and others who knew her, and that she has a history of emotionally manipulating people for money, make me think she's full of shit.  Biden was one of my least favorite candidates, but Democratic voters chose him to lead the party, so progressives need to convince him to adopt as much of our platform as we can and hone our arguments for the next Dem primary."
"The non-billionaires who voted Trump are fucking stupid, slitting open their own writs to get attention from their meth head mother who couldn't care less. And now they are bleeding out and complaining why nobody is rushing to save them from a self-inflicted wound.

To a person living in a swing state, being one of the 70k~ votes who decided the election, committing a mass shooting would be less harmful to the US as a whole than voting Trump."
"The DNC's actions make more sense when you realize Sanders was their true opponent, not Trump. Trump has been amazing for the DNC, he's an absolute lightning rod of criticism and the Democrats don't have to do anything other than exist in opposition to him to thrive. 

A Sanders win would have represented fundamental change in the way the party operates, they're much more comfortable being an opposition party to someone like Trump who is just literally the worst of everything."
"This sounds very similar to what I see on the news here, too (non US). I wonder though, if Biden may become the “anything but another 4-year stint with Trump the Twitler”.

I don’t think Biden is the best bet, but I’m definitely on the “anything but Trump” group. Biden would probably listen to his advisors and experts... hopefully."
"> If the DNC had learned from it's mistakes and undergone meaningful reform

The DNC is a conservative organisation and supports conservative candidates like Obama and Clinton and Biden.

Its got nothing to learn.  Its doing the job it intends to do.  Offer the American people a conservative option which isn't overtly racist.

If it doesn't win elections, the solution **for them** is definitely not to offer a centrist option like Sanders or something, shock horror, genuinely left of centre."
"I can say the same thing about the extreme left. Bernie lost even more vote share and the turn out voted for biden. In the past few years almost every far left candidate has got their asses handed to them every election 

So while you are teaching DNC  lessons,  the lesson you have not learned is that lying and attacking Democrats has backfired on you guys to the extent that your base has lost all relevance 

As for your prediction about trump winning, it's more a pipe fantasy and a desperate attempt to stay relevant. But the fact is, you guys will pay no role in this election and its your own doing

You had power in 2016 and people were sympathetic. But you spent that time lying as spreading propaganda against Clinton. Many if you voted trump and third party. And that caused bernie big time in 2020. Yet you will still do the same. Am glad peope like you are completely irrelevant. Every far  left candidate is getting their ass handed in every election and it's your own doing. Your lies and hate has consequences

Democrats might lose the election but they are winning in a lot of places while the far left is winning no where because of supporters like you."
Tell it like it is! The Democrats as they are now constituted are just the OTHER Republican Party.

I'm suggesting perhaps you should think twice if you find yourself using the same rhetoric that George W. Bush used to support the Iraq War. Having a very clearly righteous cause (which anti-racism certainly is) does not inherently prevent you from falling into using tactics that are bad or wrong.
"Why should the colour of someone’s skin matter in a conversation about facts regarding ideology? 
Regardless of the question, a “you’re with us or you’re against us” narrative is ultimately polarising. Instead, a “if you’re against us, why are you against us?” allows for civil conversation.
By saying someone’s opinion is invalid because of their skin colour.... Imagine if we treated nail colour the same way? Hair colour the same way? Isn’t that the ideal we all want to race issues to strive towards? Where someone’s race is as fundamental to their identity as their hair colour? Not something that defines them?"

No matter how enlightened you think you are In your early twenties it will turn out when your older that there was nuance to arguments and this one side is evil bull shit will be an embarrassing reminder to you that your early life spent being a Twitter headline revolutionary was really just a hallow attempt at trying to find a cause to rally around.
"I'm with you. He was arrested at a KKK rally, but that's not all the story is all. I don't want to defend them anymore. so I'll just tell you that if you want to really get pissed, look up the in depth NY Times story about how Fred Trump hid all his money and assets from the IRS by shifting them to his kids, starting when little Donny was 3 years old. They probably skipped out on $100-$300 million in taxes.  The US government also fined Donny when daddy had to bail out his casino by buying $3 million in casino chips then never cashing them back out. pretty clever, but they got caught."
Yeah. Biden got a lot of media coverage but we need to accept that the reason he won is because he got more votes.
Hillary won the black vote by over 50%. Stop blaming it on being rigged and wake up.
"If sanders is a centrist, what would you actually consider a far left candidate to look like? I’m genuinely curious."
I like how you guys act like the DNC is this all powerful organization. Sanders got slaughtered in the south and among african Americans. That's why he lost.

At the same time, they are trying to gaslight marginalized groups by saying the economy is doing THE BEST. Their only metric they measure economic success is by the DJI. Forget how Trump gave his wealthy doners the heads up of the true magnitude of the COVID epidemic, so they could buy up the appropriate stocks before the pandemic, all while telling all of us to not worry about COVID-19. Info that Republican senators like Richard Burr had that kind of information to make some suspicious moves in the stock market. Not to mention his grotesque remarks of how Geroge Floyd is looking down on us, proud at Trump, despite the disparity of unemployment rates between white and black populations.

Of course we're going to fight against fascism. We didn't fall asleep during history class like the rest of this country apparently did. We're trying to  prevent dangerous ideologues from taking control of this country and imposing their will on the rest of the country that disagrees with him by wanting to use the military to crack down on dissenters.

"This. 
Fundamentally the lack of willingness to have a conversation about these issue is a HUGE problem. Labelling every single person who says ‘All Lives Matter’ as racist first, rather than potentially just being ignorant, only serves to further the division.
Does anyone agree that racism is a good thing? No, I think you’ll be hard pressed to find a large number of people who still think that way as individuals. 
Is identifying, and then generalising into a large group (racists), everyone who says a specific phrase a good way to encourage discourse and civil conversation about the topic? 
I’m not suggesting in any way that racism is acceptable in our society in any form, but if we continue to relentlessly identify groups, identity politics, we are doomed to have a polarised narrative. 
Being outraged is easy. Being compassionate is hard."

This was 2018.
That was genuinely the most depressing part of any movie.
"Five minutes could be the difference between a painless instant death, or being violently and painfully eviscerated by aliens. In their position they felt completely hopeless and had zero idea that the military was even fighting back or where they were going. 

It sucks that in the end they were just moments away from being rescued, but they really had no idea of that. 

What really is ironic is the one girl (actress who plays carol on twd) who walked out into the mist alone to find her daughter had the happy ending out of all of them and made the right decision."
">""The truth is, we have *All* been there before... the real question is, why don’t think I was just hearing things. But idk I don’t *you* remember?"
I never seen the movie nor do I have any idea what's it's about other than people being scared in a store cuz some intense fog popped outta nowhere. Is that how the movie ended? The mist just came and went away?
the point was sort of the 'actual threat' was a little too quick to avoid and kys for - and it was going on for so long they had no reason to suspect there to be a light at the end of the tunnel
"Same.  Never seen it since that first time, despite it being one of the best King adaptations.

"Lots of really nasty alien creatures. Watch the movie, it's great."
"The basic premise is the army opens a dimensional portal of some kind. Creatures slip through the portal so does a mist. Chaos ensues in a small town some people try to hole up in a grocery store the position becomes undefendable due to smashed windows and a out if control fire. Man, his son are the main characters he tries to escape to retrieve his wife and bug out finds wife dead bugs out with son. In the book you don't know what happens they just drive off. In the movie they're trapped in a wagoneer with one bullet left instead of getting torn apart by creatures he kills his son with the last bullet. He's sad and lays down to wait to die after some time the mist lifts and the army is coming to save the town.

It's been a while since I watched it but people in this thread are saying it was only 5 minutes after he killed his kid. I thought it was longer like he fell asleep and when he woke up the mist was clearing.

SK wrote another book call ""From a Buick 8"" that book had similar dimensional beings in it but didn't do a great job at describing them I had already read it by the time I saw this movie and the one thing it did for me was give me a visual of the creatures. The Mist was an ok movie but it's one of those ""how to panic 101"" kinda films."

"Don't listen to the other comment putting the movie down, watch it for yourself because it's an amazing movie."
"The Mist. It's not good, I wouldn't recommend it. A lot of poor acting, unconvincing CGI, and pretty heavy handed messaging, wrapped up with a dissatisfying ending that barely feels like a conclusion."
"eh not much though - and when you're at the despair event horizon and you think the entire world's fucked and you've only got pain and more loss to look forward to - you're not exactly thinking about delaying biting the bullet. it's very much a 'fuck this shit i'm out' if your only escape is suicide.

&#x200B;

if you'd rather risk it and try to survive then there's hardly a point when you'd bite the bullet - someone like you would be like ""no wait they're not in yet"" probably till it was too late.

The cylindrical mapping of the graph per year is a great idea. Haven't seen that before.  Really nice and fitting for r/dataisbeautiful

This needs to be shared over and over!
Bro it snowed in may in Connecticut.
"Looking at the global temperatures of the past 800,000 would give you a different conclusion."
Wait wait wait... So we've really dialed back on our pollution due to covid and temps still rise? What's the explanation for that?
"Thanks, didn't want to sleep anyway"
Sad that we have no temperature data from 10-th and 11-th century during a medieval optimum. You could grow wine grapes in Scotland and grow crops in Norway beyond polar circle. I wish we could do that now and people no longer had to live in hell holes like Norilsk and many other extremely cold cities.

"Good, it was lovely in Britain. 

The only places this will really affect are shitholes which are already way too hot. Build some decent flood defences and move a bit inland and most developed countries have nothing to worry about. Hell, most of Russia could go from frozen wasteland to massive areas of viable farmland."
Cheers! Check my profile for more ;-)
"Yea. Usually these ""creative"" formats don't improve on the traditional, simple graph designs."
The text would be too tiny to read.
"We are not thoroughly fucked, but at the moment we are working on being just that :-(

The science says that we have to 2050 to go carbon neutral (and preferably start to suck CO2 from the atmosphere). That is a realistic goal as we have most of the knowledge and technology needed.

It is a psychological problem, not a technical problem. 

99.99% of all people will be better off in a world without fossile fuels, but sadly the remaining 0.01% is spending a lot of their money to gaslight us into believing that there is no problem and that they should be allowed to continue to ruin our atmosphere."
"We're descending the slippery slope.  That doesn't mean we're going to fall off. We need global systemic change now. If we had better leadership, we could use this global pause we're in now to really enact useful changes in usage and energy sources."
Yeah it just ramps up so rapidly these last decades.
When there is inter annual variability you have to be careful with statements like this. Back in the early 2000s  people argued global warming was a sham due to a few years of minimal T change. Now that small flat period is insignificant. The trend overall is still an increase in T however.
"This was a really neat visualisation. It's hard to read the details, but it excellently shows the trend, and it _is_ beautiful."
February 2016 is the warmest month on record.
That last one is probably one of the greatest news I've seen in this front. I reckon in 2020 the rate of divestment will be higher with the pandemic and all that. Hopefully it's the start of good things to come.
"> The most valuable car company in the world is an American 100% electric vehicle manufacturer.
 
I agree with your overall point, but this one is not really a sign of anything.  The stock market is irrational and runs largely on hype, and Tesla is one of the most over-hyped companies on the planet.  Nikola Corp., an electric truck start-up that has never produced a vehicle, was briefly valued higher than Ford last week.  Those valuations have little to do with reality."
"Actually hydro, when possible, is the best. It costs a lot to build the central but it will produce a lot of green electricity. Where I live (Québec), 99,99% of the electricity is made from big dams in northen Québec and we have the cheapest electricity in all of North America and possibly the world. The 0.01% is a small fuel central that produce electricity for a few thousand people on a remote island in the middle of the Saint-Laurent Golf."
"This bit of information could be a post of its own somewhere else on reddit. While it’s important to stress the bad news and encourage change, it’s equally important to see the change we’ve made and celebrate it. Great post!"
UK burning biomasses instead
"Yes, it is."
Here's [NASA's explanation](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/faq/#q102)
Sure: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/
It's an anomaly if you compare it to the climate during which humans have existed. And the rate of change is an anomaly if you compare it to all the data we have.
"I agree ""anomaly"" is not the correct word. If anything it's one more data point in a continuing trend."
"Cheers!

I have seen someone do that and it becomes a tangled incomprehensible mess. It was sort of an inspiration for me for this, that and a seismic drum."
"They are the ""Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies"""
"I'm old enough to remember when ""let's keep it under 350ppm"" was the goal."
"Turn that into action, vote for people with strong green credentials."
"Outside of mentalists, few people deny the temperature is rising.

The cause is the disputed part.

Man made vs. natural cycles."
Weather and climate are different bro
"The speed of warming is unprecedented. We're on track to reach temperature changes in decades that have taken thousands of years in the past. That's a big difference.

The environment takes much longer to adapt and we're already witnessing severe consequences of that. If you don't care about the environment, there will be human and economic consequences too. The mean sea levels were 10+ meters higher back then. That would cut into most of our coastlines. Pretty expensive when you look at everything we've built there."
Really? You have some data to back that up?
"Think of a bucket filling up with about 5 different taps running into it; one each for electricity & heat, agriculture, transportation, forestry, and manufacturing.

The transportation and maybe the manufacturing tap were turned down a little bit."
It was very much a local phenomenon as it was cooler than normal in the Pacific making the [global temperatures average out to nothing interesting](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/2000%2B_year_global_temperature_including_Medieval_Warm_Period_and_Little_Ice_Age_-_Ed_Hawkins.svg/1920px-2000%2B_year_global_temperature_including_Medieval_Warm_Period_and_Little_Ice_Age_-_Ed_Hawkins.svg.png).
You should probably do some research on the actual effects of climate change if you think this is true
"That's not exactly the point. Mentalities like that are WHY we are fucked. 

""Guys! It's not hot now. It's a great climate! Only hot areas are getting worse.""

Except thats not true. Eventually everywhere is going to be a hot area. This exponentially increasing spiral of heat in this graph is only going to grow. Much of the globe is going to be completely uninhabitable because of mentalities like the one you have."
"""Its good for me, so fuck all those hot countries"""
"If climate change continues it'll start affecting the gulf stream which provides all of Europe with nice, warm weather year round. Without it your lovely Britain weather will turn into lovely Canada weather"
"That's a pretty poor way of looking at the situation. Rapid change will cause agriculture failure on places that import a vast amount of produce to the rest of the world. Many hot countries import huge amounts climate dependant food and thinking it won't affect you because you live in the UK is laughable. Rising levels will sink coastal towns which the UK has many of. Rapid climate change will render many countries who are already hot inhospitable and will force massive amounts of people into hospitable zones, these climate refugees will put even more pressure on an already failing system and create massive conflict zones. If you are so naive you think you will be fine on your little island climate disruption will be unprecedented and if we make it through  life will never be the same again."
"And the people who already live in those warmer areas should just fuck off and die, I suppose?"
Your posts are amazing! What a gold mine!
what do you use for these?
Maybe you could use a subtitle?
Well the current title is kinda misleading
Do you by chance have any links to this science that says we have until 2050? Climate change is an issue close to my heart and I could use some positivity
[Need to do something about population growth too](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63657-6). Resource use is not sustainable and will come back to bite us.
Can the poorest people in the world afford to go to more expensive fuel sources? Do they have the money to invest in renewable infrastructure? Some people don’t have clean water or electricity today at all.
">99.99% of all people will be better off in a world without fossile fuels, but sadly the remaining 0.01% is spending a lot of their money to gaslight us

That's simply not true. Most gas consumption is to the drastic material benefit of most people, and cannot be replaced currently without fossil fuels. The only hope for that would be nuclear power, and everybody ran screaming away from that - there is no other alternative. Solar and wind are not efficient enough, they require too much maintenance, land, and money. Several nations you hear about in Europe going ""carbon free"" or whatever are just using creative accounting with where they get their energy and what they're doing with their mines, but the world very much cannot exist in a modern sense without fossil fuels, as it currently stands."
"Problem is, those people are not going to die by 2050.. at least not most of them, which means a small portion of the world is going to be doing everything they can to save it, but the mayority of assholes will not care at all. The 2050 projection will stretch till, probably ¿2060? and it's going to be some pretty bad 15 years, starting on 2045..   
that is, with good luck."
"I assure you, sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere is a technical problem. It’s basically impossible. You can’t pull that much CO2 out of the atmosphere. Even if you could there’s nowhere to put it (if you think of a permanent storage location for 5000 billion tons of baking soda let me know). 

The people who invented carbon sequestration regret it, because people like you actually put hope in it. 

1000% of your hope regarding removing carbon from the atmosphere is derived from a lack of understanding the size and complexity of the problem. 

If you want to stay in the dark that’s fine, but things are far, far more bleak than you seem to understand.

I’m just glad I won’t be around at the turn of the century. Heck, New York will be underwater by 2080 at the latest. Imagine when our largest cities start to go under.

Edit: getting upvoted and downvoted constantly. But what I’m not seeing is anyone who can factually disagree with me. Sadly, you aren’t going to see that happen."
"I don't know. I highly doubt that almost everyone will be better off without fossil fuels. Supply would probably decrease by a lot, and stuff would get more expensive.

In the long run, yeah, it'd be better for everyone. But probably not instantly."
"Positive feedback loops are activating that increase the rate of change. Some of these ([like melting permafrost](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/01/11/thawing-permafrost-matters/)) will further contribute to ongoing emissions. Also, even if we stop all emissions warming continues for decades to centuries. Governments need to get serious, this is a legitimate threat to our futures and shareholder profits won't help us."
"Divesting from fossil fuels and burning biomasses, i.e. trees."
"Totally agree, you should only value a company on its sales performance.

[Oh](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/GPVVJ/s4/tesla-model-3-sales-in-u-s-source-james-stephenson-icannot-enough.jpg)."
"Biomass is better than coal, coal is introducing additional carbon into the atmosphere while biomass is part of the carbon cycle. Of course if you're using diesel vehicles to collect and move the biomass it's not carbon neutral but less carbon intensive."
"Biomass is either burnt, releasing the co2 into the atmosphere, or bacteria break it down, releasing the co2 into the atmosphere."
"Oh, right, so because of our extensive records the relatively recent post industrial revolution era is basically one big anomaly because of all the CO2 pollution. I thought it meant that there was an unprecedented spike that went beyond what climate change has done so far.

EDIT: This is not sarcasm."
"It's definitely a continuing trend , but anomaly is the correct technical term in climate science. It's just a type of measurement referring to the deviation from a long term average as opposed to the absolute temperature. That's what OP graphed. You can have a temperature anomaly of 0.0°C, which would mean the temperature is identical to the long term average."
"That's just it though. I feel like even though we live in a world where information is so readily available. People will just continue to manipulate data to benefit their own agenda and most people are non the wiser. 
Maybe one day they will learn from their mistakes. Though I feel like it's our children who will see the repercussions. Not the people responsible. I try my best to call out climate deniers but the issue stems from the very top of the system unfortunately. Best defense we have is still data like this. I just hate seeing it get worse every year."
"The speed of warming is unprecedented? The absence of humility regarding our lengthy and intangible past amazes me. You know that how? Both rapid and slow change were commonplace throughout our geologic history, a basic principle in this discipline."
Literally [NASA](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQagJYtaajArOzpQ1xPEU96cnfANh8VYpFQY_AjmZgRyPZ0ZWbD&usqp=CAU) and the  [EPICA](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/EPICA_temperature_plot.svg/1280px-EPICA_temperature_plot.svg.png) Project.
"Gotcha.

Well, then we're fucked. We can't control the others, policies will never be approved to severely limit them, and what we can control apparently makes no difference."
It's just not true that 'everywhere is going to be hot'. Not for thousands of years anyway.
"This is nonsense which is repeated to make Britain care about climate change. Even if true, people in Canada survive fine.

Worst case scenario I move to trad Russia"
Yeah I honestly don’t know how most of those posts have so little upvotes
It's what the IPCC lays out. Im sure you can find it on Google knowing that.
"I can get you links to the science ; I let you judge if that count as positivity.    
The UNEP (parent organization of the IPCC) produces every year an [Emissions Gap Report](https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2019), that basically tells how far we are from where we should be."
"Education, economic opportunity and availability of birth control seems to take care of that (its why birth rates are so low in developed countries). Its why we should be focusing on developing 'developing countries' faster. It helps everyone."
"I don't see how what you quoted is contradictory to your response. It just said pretty much everyone would be better off in a clean world, but the rich of the rich are spending their money to prevent that. 

It's literally true. What you said is also true."
"Here is the thing. 

Technically sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere is possible if you have an unlimited budget 

however!

Its like WAY WAY WAY cheaper to just decarbonize. By a lot. So its fucking pointless"
"Fuck man, I didn't need to get more sad for the future... It's great to know that I'll be even more fucked than I thought"
"You are totally right. Even if the carbon dioxyde represents less than 1% of the atmosphere, people forget it is millions of tons of carbon dioxyde.

There is simply no other way than to stop using fossil fuels, stop cutting down entire forests, stop urban sprawl and adopting measures to reduce the impact of cities on the environnement."
"That's comparing one vehicle to 5 other specific vehicles.  As a company, they are nowhere near most.  [This](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2019-u-s-auto-manufacturer-sales-figures/) compares total sales figures, Tesla is 13th of 15 in the US.  For instance, they had about 4% of GM's sales in 2019."
218k combustible-engine luxury sedans purchased vs 178k Tesla.  Looks like Tesla has got a lot of work to do!
"except that a lot of 'biomass' consists of logging huge old forests and planting tiny trees, meaning that although in a century that forest will exist again, right now we are adding more CO2."
I'm not sure what you're trying to tell me.
"OP did not address long term and specifically mentioned the month of May as being an anomaly.  In the long term sense, the OPs data is *all* an anomaly. But within the data set that is being presented it's just the continuance of the trend."
"Our past is lengthy but not fully intangible. Certainly not in the last 800,000 years. We have a lot of reliable [temperature proxies](https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/drafts/fod/Ch06_FOD_Text_TSU_FINAL.pdf) and we can definitely tell when something happened over thousands of years as opposed to decades. Our current changes are in no way a 'basic principle in this discipline'. Just ask practically anyone in this discipline.

Sure, if you go back millions of years, things like the Siberian Traps may have caused rapid climate change too, but that is always clearly associated with a cause. It also caused most life on Earth to go extinct 250 million years ago.

Scientists have a strong understanding of our geologic history and also of the mechanisms of climate change (current and historical). I'll never understand the mindset where a bunch of people with no expertise in a subject have more credibility than practically every expert studying that subject.

(Ongoing skepticism is great, but outright denial of expert consensus is not)"
"I'm well aware of those graphs and the natural trends that temperatures change over thousands of years, as is practically every scientist. 

That's not really relevant in the context of our current climate change because the time scale is extremely different. All those spikes look rapid because the x-axis is literally hundreds of thousands of years. The current warming does not compare and it is not natural."
"I wont be uninhabitable just because its hot. Even in britain droughts are becoming a problem, and they wont stop becoming more intense. Couple that with far more intense storms and generally more extreme weather and things start to look less rosy.

Then you have to keep in mind that there are other countries aswell, and that like a billion refugees from actually uninhabitable places doesnt sound good at all. We could probably manage it, but as things went with the syrian refugees i'll bet all money on european countries closing their borders and killing everyone who tries to enter. Just as they did and are still doing, just less extreme."
"I haven't researched the topic much, so I don't know the timeframe, but I'm pretty frickin certain it isn't thousands of years. I thought the uninhabitableness of our world was more of a 100 year thing"
It's not Britain it's almost the whole of Europe. The only thing that keeps Europe warm is the gulf stream. I can't understand how people choose to believe the conspiracy theories that Karen from Facebook shares rather than the data that tens of thousands of people dedicated their lives gathering and studying
I haven't figured it out. It's all down to the first half hour in new.
"Perfect, thanks very much"
"That won’t fix the problem that once developed their carbon foot print will be a lot larger.

Look at China as an example.

So if we don’t find a solution to provide wealth to everyone with a reasonable footprint, we’ll have to keep a lot of people poor."
"There’s pretty much nothing humanity can’t do if we all worked together toward a common goal. That’s what break my heart about this. 

If people could even just see CO2, it would make this so much easier. 

As it stands, humanity will certainly survive. Civilization past 2100 or so becomes touch and go. The Earth will only be able to support maybe a billion people by that point. Although technology might be able to do a lot about food shortages. That’s easy compared to carbon."
This exactly. Teslas are also comparably new and there still come a lot of issues with electric cars. So only time will tell how long term these cars will hold up.
"I'm saying I was confused as to why this was called an anomaly when temperature records are constantly being broken year by year as more pollution is pumped into the atmosphere in a very easy to track pattern.

An anomaly is normally something unexpected that deviates from patterns, but rising temperatures due to climate change are a clear pattern so I was confused. But as you pointed out, if you consider climate records from all of recorded history then this rapid increase in temperatures we are experiencing is anomalous because of the short time frame in which it is happening relative to everything else.

And now people are down voting my stuff for some reason, so I think they are either just as confused as we both were and they assume I am denying climate change exists (it does exist and is very bad just to be clear), or they knew what I was saying but think climate change isn't real probably due to some kind of fetal alcohol syndrome."
"Did OP say that differently in a comment somewhere?

I was just saying that the term 'Global monthly temperature anomaly' in the title is correct. Its just the name of a type of measurement. It doesn't imply that any measurement is unusual or unexpected.

OP did address the long term because that's how all of the temperature anomalies are calculated. Each value is the difference between a given month's temperature and the average of all months between 1951-1980."
"You are absolutely incorrect. Temperatures proxies have nowhere near the resolution, precision, or accuracy to ascertain what you deem as ""rapid,"" and if you'd ever read any of those comical papers that claim such nonsense you'd laugh. Yes, I am a geologist.

If you are a geologist, I will continue discussing. We will start with quaternary alluvial deposits a thousand feet above the floodplain, work in forams, and go from there."
It definitely isn't anywhere near 100 years. We'll be long dead before any of the (questionable) predictions come true

Comment
"It's really nice that you're a nice person, but don't live thinking you are dumb. This is not true, you may not have some basic knowledge but there are many types of knowledge and you still can learn many thinga in your life."
Do you know there are a lot of highly qualified people who haven't figured out how to be a positive influence on others? You have.
"First and foremost, you sound like an amazing, wonderful young woman and I'm sure the people in your life are better off for having known you.

Second, you're confusing knowledge and intelligence. Just because you don't know something doesn't make you stupid.

Third, intelligence isn't what its cracked up to be. Focus more on the positive traits you have, kindness and empathy. They matter far more. Edit: basically what you wrote in the headline is spot on."
"It sounds like your EQ is high (emotional quotient) which is really important in having a happy life.
You may not think you’re smart but IQ isn’t everything.
I’ve known some really, really smart people who are just mean and miserable and I’d chose kind people over people like that any day

Just keep being you, you sound like a very caring person and we don’t have enough in the world."
Being self-aware about not knowing a lot is not a sign of dumbness !
"You do realise that you would not have noticed how much it is that you don't know, if you weren't smart? There's  smart and smart. You may not have all the knowledge, but you sure have the capability to get it if you want.
I agree with one thing, being kind is much more important that being extra-smart."
"You have the whole rest of your life to get smarter. If you’re really interested in increasing your knowledge base the best advice I can give you is to read, read, and read some more.  Start by reading the newspaper everyday.  When you read articles with information you don’t know about or concepts you don’t understand, google it to get a general idea of what it is and move along.  Eventually you will build up your knowledge base by reading and understanding more about the world.   BTW - you don’t have to read an actual newspaper of you don’t have access to one. Just read the top stories on Apple news, but do it daily.  

If the news/current events is of no interest to you, find something that is and read about that.  

You sound like a really lovely person."
"Knowing trivia does not make you smart. There are lots of ways intelligence works for us. Sounds like your brain focuses on empathy and caring. How awesome is that? There are millions of “smart” people who have no ability to care about anything other than themselves and I’d much rather spend time with someone like you than them. 

My career is highly technical. I’ve run into so many technically smart people who were complete asses. They are completely ineffective because nobody respects them. The people who are friendly and use emotional intelligence (which you seem to have plenty of and is far more important) go so much further even though they may not have all of the technical knowledge. 

Anyone can learn facts and figures. Being a good person is harder and so much more fulfilling though. Good luck!"
"A few things:

The whole point of 'Are You Smarter Than a 5  th Grader' is it is meant to make you feel stupid.  If it was easy, there wouldn't be a game, would there?

Secondly, everyone is dumb with some things.  Everyone is smart with other things.  It just depends where you've invested your time.   Trivia just might not be it, and tbh, that's fine. :)"
"Honestly I'm not convinced you're 'dumb' in the first place.

There are 2 things that make me say this:

1. There are many different forms of intelligence. I don't think what you've described in your post is enough to disqualify you for all of them (if any): https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences

2. You're labelling yourself negatively... I'm dumb (bad) but I make up for it by being a nice person (good) in other ways. This sounds like you're rejecting a part of yourself, and you're trying to 'make up' for it with another quality.

So maybe, during your life you've built up a negative conviction about your intelligence. A conviction like that can result in a bias, overvaluing supporting evidence and undervaluing evidence to the contrary. This bias in turn can result in a 'self-fulfulling prophecy' where the conviction blocks your qualities. It would take a lot more evidence to convince me this is not the case with you.

Pretty blunt. But my honest two cents."
"There are plenty of things you can do to improve your general knowledge. Once you have that under control, you'll be the perfect human."
"You may not know a lot of general knowledge facts, but that doesn't mean you're dumb. Maybe you have some other kind of knowledge, as small as it may seem in the world. You know, I've always found it funny that the show compares your smartness with a fifth grader's, because truth be told most of those kids forget those things as soon as they enter sixth grade. I know because I have siblings that age. They're a mix of smart and dumb. And they have so much time to learn. 

And so do you! You shouldn't feel dumb about things like these, but if you want to learn more of it, it's never too late! And no matter what, the right people will always see the good, the kind, and the smart (yes, smart, even if you think you're dumb) in you."
"I feel like this is a fixed mindset. A fixed mindset days this is who I am and thus is how I will always be. You have a lot of wonderful life ahead of you. That said, you have a lot of growing you can do and will do. If you are willing to focus on what you can control when it comes to your intelligence then you step more likely to be successful. Maybe you're like me and will need to work harder than the average person to accomplish what you are looking for but if you are willing to keep a ln attitude of growing or a growth mindset and out in the time effort and energy you will improve. Thanks for being nice. That sounds like an adherent characteristic of yours. But dint accept things as they are if you can and are willing to change them."
"You seem like a great person. People place too much weight on being successful, and they forget about being kind."
"Yes. This is absolutely true. Your social skills will be much more important than academic skills in fostering a healthy adult life.  I don’t think that there’s anything wrong with continuing to learn about whatever interests you, but a huge bank of trivia isn’t necessary for happiness."
"You have excellent grammar and spelling. You write well. Dumb people can’t do those things. 

Don’t sell yourself short."
You’re an amazing person and I’d be super happy if any of my kids married someone just like you!
Are you smarter than a 5th grader is one of the most irrelevant “intelligence tests” you can possibly do. How often will you need to know that information? I think anybody would agree that being able to compliment strangers is a much more useful type of intelligence.
"I like this quote

""The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know"" - Albert Einstein"
Just from the way your post is written I’d say you come across as pretty bright
"Not everyone is made for education system. While I agree with the importance of education, but I also feel it's not everything.

But I will still recommend you to study hard to be at least independent in life. Good luck. You are awesome person. Just don't let other people abuse your kindness."
"I don’t think you’re dumb. I guarantee that you’re not!! Not everyone can bake (that’s SCIENCE AND MATH!). Most people don’t take the time to visit with senior citizens (that’s SOCIAL STUDIES and in talking to them I’d bet you’re learning real life HISTORY!!) 

Who cares if you don’t know trivia that makes up a game? If what fun playing the game that’s what counts! YOU ARE A WINNER!!!"
"Read your post back as if someone else wrote it, then decide if you are really dumb or just a kind caring person :)"
"I don't think you sound dumb at all. You sound very knowledgeable in the ways of friendship and being a good person! A lot of people aren't, so actually you're way ahead of the curve."
"To me the dumbest thing you can do is live an unkind life. You sound like the bright spark the world needs more of, and there's nothing dumb about being that."
"you seem like a great gal! I always thought that intelligent can be created if you studied hard enough, but kindness and thoughtfulness are with you when you're born!"
"I have to say, a lot of the smart people I know try their hardest to make others feel appreciate how great they are or to make them feel worse. And a lot of people in general I know are like that too, I guess. But what you're describing is the best kind of person, smart or not. If you're brightening other people's lives, if you're enjoying your life, that's literally the only thing that matters - that is the only thing you really gotta try to achieve!!"
"This is such Hufflepuff energy. In all seriousness though, as long as you are happy that's all that matters, just don't let your self image define or limit what you can accomplish"
"You write really well, that's a skill not many people have."
"I would prefer nice and honest people over any other set of qualities. Being nice is good, just don't let people walk all over you.

The world needs more nice people."
"You sound like a really emotionally intelligent person, also self aware. A lot of people aren’t and it’sa thing to cherish (I’m a bit of a bimbo too, but my lovely friends have taught me that my strengths are in other areas like art )"
"This right here is why I'm a bottom-up (anti-authoritarian) socialist. The friendly cashier is more of a pillar of the community than any billionaire could ever be. People like you should be seen as role-models. Working a repetitive, but vital job and spreading love to others, truly fantastic. 

Everyday life for all people gets easier and more enjoyable thanks to people like you, and I wish society would reward that instead of the faceless conglomerates that control the markets."
"Bruh, cashiering means you math = you smart. And clearly you're a kind person. You're good human like that. The world needs more good humans like you. Stay awesome."
"I've worked with a lot of people and I can tell you if I had a chance, I'll take the nice ""dumb"" over the ""smart"" one with an attitude anyday. I'd rather have to constantly train a worker until they get it than deal with someone who thinks they're too good for the job. Being personable goes a long way."
"Knowledge and intellect are separate things. You can know things but still be stupid, likewise you can be ignorant about things and be intelligent.

The very fact that you are aware that you don't know things is a form of intelligence and I bet you are knowledgeable about the things you are passionate about.

IMO kindness is more important than intellect any day."
"Well, there's basic knowledge and there's emotional intelligence. I know a few doctors in my family who will say the most hurtful and tone deaf things, never knowing it's wrong. My sister, on the other hand, tries very hard not to offend anyone, and is quite likeable, though she is considered not as bright as the rest of the cousins."
I’d rather be in the company of a kind person than an unkind person who happens to remember everything I’ve forgotten from the fifth grade. Lol
"Hey op, you sound like a genuinely lovely person. Honestly empathy and kindness and in such short supply these days. As for smarts, you may have already found the subject you are fantastic at and know it better than your peers. Intelligence is just more than book smarts."
"I have a friend who always calls herself dumb because she can’t do maths and isn’t very academic and doesn’t really have any talent (her words, not mine). But she’s so fkn street smart and knows how to work a crowd and has the best sense of humour. Remember that there are so many different kinds of intelligence!"
"Do not mistake knowledge for intelligence, they are very different things..."
"Hola COURAGEOUS nice girl!! 
Serve, love, give."
"I disagree. I don't think you are dumb. I don't believe that there is such thing as a dumb person. An ignorant, I can believe that. 

No, you're smart in other areas. I'm dumb when it comes to emotions. I'm dumb when it comes to social interactions."
"I think being nice is the most important thing you can be. It's good to be intelligent, empathetic, experienced, quick-witted, well-build, charismatic, loyal and hardworking, but if you were to choose one, I would always choose being nice and decent to others.

I've had periods if low self esteem, and yet, even when I feel like I was the least impressive as a person, I've always had friends who want to be around me. I can't say that it's because I'm nice, but I try to be. Maybe they're connected, maybe not, but either way, I think you have the right idea!"
"There’s a difference between being smart and being intelligent.

Not many can face a situation of self-reflection like you did. But you did it, and come out on top realizing all the good you bring to the world and to the people around you. Also, good on your friends for not kicking someone around!

This world is deprived of people who are smart like you. So, please, be the the smart and emotionally & energetically connected person you are. Life’s in a better place for it, thanks to you :)"
Honestly it doesn't matter how smart one is it just matters if they make a good difference in the world.
"Being nice is really good, good job man"
"Learning stuff isn't that hard.

Learning to be nice is very, very hard.

You are far ahead of many people."
I don't know if this helps but I've always thought that I'd much rather my child to be dumb and kind than smart and horrible. You sound like a really sweet person and trying your best on top of it. I think that is very nice of you.
"When a girl claims she’s dumb, she is actually really clever."
"Trivia isn't really a barometer of intelligence.

You know what will make you 'smart'? Curiosity.   
If you don't know something, take 5-10 minutes out of your day to learn about it. It may not sound like much, but the knowledge you gain from doing this stacks up trenemendously in your life time.

For example, if you don't know what barometer means in this post when you read it, give it a google. You'll be that little bit smarter in just a couple of seconds.

I'm 30 now, and I find I know a little about a *LOT*. I can engage with just about anyone to at least some extent, and that leaves me room to be curious and learn even more."
"Oh no! I bet you are amazing. You can acquire any Knowledge and skills easily and with the internet everybody can learn anything even better than school 
Trust me, your friends are fortunate to have you as a friend.
Its very hard to come across kind people 
Stay true to yourself, everything will be alright eventually 
.
.
Can you think of a really embarrassing thing your friend did a while ago?
I bet you don't 
We just tend to make a big deal out of things in our mind 
Have a great life stranger <3"
In my opinion i'd say this shows a higher level of intelligence than being academically smart. The world needs more kind people like you
"Being smart and having knowledge are two very different things. I’ve met engineers who thought Croatia was in Africa and I’ve met people who barely knew how to write and read, yet were able to make really smart decisions in life.
Intelligence is not necessarily being good at math or knowing a lot about geography, it’s about how you are able to survive, are able to make friends? Do you have a good orientation sense? Are you able to make smart choices when it comes to your future? This is what you should thrive for.

Everybody is smart but ask a fish to climb a tree and he will spend his life thinking he’s stupid.

And by the way, kindness and awareness are considered as signs of intelligence."
"As long as you have purpose, that's all that's important.

We, as a nation, are mostly emotional and have terrible memories and cognitive abilities. And we get angry and defensive about everything.

Why do you think ""Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader"" even exists? Because most of us aren't."
"The only dumb thing is to use the word ""dumb"" :)

Don't ever neg yourself.  There are many tossers in the world who take pleasure in putting people down, so don't be one of them - even to yourself!

I was raised in a family of boys and it was made clear that my vagina means I can't be smart,  ambitious, worthy. Eff that shit!! 

Like you,  I make the world a bit better place every day just by living in it.  

I may never be a genius like my youngest brother, an author like the eldest, but I'm actually glad because one's emotionally empty and the other is an alcoholic. 

I made a child smile today,  and cleaned up the litter from a stretch of riverfront. That's a good day. 

You sound balanced, and fun,  and personable,  and clever ( I don't really know what coding is but I can get reasonable marks in my philosophy class lol) and like you have a good heart.

People like you bring smiles that can be felt on the inside and that ability can't be taught or learned,  it's a gift that you have and share.  Rock it!"
I dont think its a question of how smart you are. I just noticed that people who read alot are usually more informed
Unconditional kindness requires a special and rare kind of wisdom.
Emotional intelligence is also an important form of being smart and i seems like you have a lot of those smarts.
"I'm right there with you, I don't talk too much, I'm not the brightest and I lack a lot of knowledge about many things. Hell I don't even really know the names of the main streets in my town where I've lived for 8 years! But I do my best to be nice and respectful to people, intelligence aside! At the end of the day I reckon that's all that matters."
"The reason they choose fifth grade is because half of the things you learn aren't relevant later in life, so it's testing your memory more than your intelligence. You don't sound dumb to me."
"Being ""dumb"" and ""smart"" is all perspective based. Compared to Einstein I'm dumb, compared to my little brother I'm a genius, but that's all they are, comparisons against others. You are smart, you are beautiful, you are strong and all of the above compared to yourself! The only comparison that matters is your current self to your past self. Strive to be better than you were yesterday."
grinning while reading this
"Its amazing that your such a nice person. But remember, nobody is born smart or dumb. All knowledge has to be learned. Even the brightest minds you know were not born that way. It is all aquired as life goes on. Which means you may not be smart right now. But the knowlege is still available to you if you are willing to learn."
You are smarter than you think if you know being kind is more important.  A lot of “ smart” people have a hard time learning this.
"As someone who values intelligence in my friends and romantic partners let me say this.
Empathy and kindness are truely more important! 
Open minded empathetic people are truely the best to have in your life. You're honest about things from the sounds of it and you should be proud of that! 
And if anyone mocks you for your intelligence remember, they likely have a complex or simply feel like such shit they need to mock folks to feel good about themselves! 

The best relationships I've had in fact occur when without even using words my partner just ""gets"" what I'm feeling/thinking. The first time I experienced that I nearly cried lmao.
Keep rocking it okay?"
"You sound like one of the nicest people out there. Keep up with the good shit, basic knowledge isn't fundamental"
"Aw man that “at least you’re cute” thing hit too close to home, it really hurts your self esteem. Honestly, I use to care so so much about how intelligent I was and whether or not other people thought I was smart, but at the end of the day, it really doesn’t matter. How you treat people is how they remember you. And if you ever want to expand your knowledge, there’s so many online courses that you can pace yourself. 

[Emotional intelligence](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/emotional-intelligence) is also a thing, knowing how to interact with people and having a strong moral compass isn’t something everyone has. I’m happy for you, keep up your kindness!"
Your story reminds me of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomeanimemes/comments/cvzfrt/everyones_bad_at_something/)
"Adopt a growth mindset! 
We’re not static beings, we’re dynamic and we are always changing. Rather than thinking of yourself as dumb, say that you have room to get smarter and then recognize it when you do. Every single day is a day to learn something new or to refine or master something you already do know. You’re doing this already. The simple fact that you took the time to reflect on your feelings shows it."
"You know, I didn't do good in highschool either. Then I also dropped out of college after failing every single class. I can't say I'm dumb though. Some people just don't do well with school stuff, or just aren't ready to do school stuff. I'm back in college now, and I am doing pretty good. I just didn't care about it before. School smarts aren't the only type of smarts out there."
"Those that are truly dumb are completely ignorant of it.

Smarts can be taught - learn about what you love and what you care about. The rest isn’t important as long as you’re kind."
"You write better and more articulately than lots of people I know in the engineering world. There are definitely different types of intelligences, you should look into that!"
"Wow this sounds just like me, I feel like I say literally your title all the time ahah.  Kindness is so lost in the world, I love being able to put some out"
"Academia is not the knowledge I respect or admire. I like people who are sensitive, considerate and aware. I think that's the whole point of being a human, being accommodative. But I also hate the phrase""u r pretty u dont have to be smart"" it's a bit sexist,  dont u think? Men think a women's ultimate goal on life is getting laid. If u r actions are not conflicting ur beliefs then u dont have to worry about anything,  u r the greatest human alive..."
"I think you have a completely different type of intelligence. Very few people truly understand how helpful and important it is what you’re doing. Heck, some of us never truly understand the value of it. To this day I still have trouble engaging in conversations and being nice to ppl. So, in my opinion, you’re a very smart woman that understands concepts that for a lot of us are incredibly difficult. So what if you don’t know how tall the Alps are?! You can have conversations with senior ppl - something that I can guarantee for a lot of ppl it is an incredibly difficult thing to approach."
"That was a popular game show for a reason, the adults lost a lot!

We compartmentalize information and store some, but most gets forgotten. 

You sound like an awesome person and a better friend, don’t beat yourself up OP!"
Kindness wins over smartness very time.
"Being kind is THE most important thing you can be. You sound like a genuine soul and I’m sure you make the world a better place for those around you! 
What is knowledge without compassion!!! You keep doing you"
I don't believe anyone is dumb. Not having the knowledge on something popular doesn't make you dumb. I wasn't aware of how football worked until like 14 because I don't like watching sports.
"I liken myself to a faithful old golden retriever. He just can learn things the way you want, but he's to friendly to get rid of. The fact you take the time to do the things you do, makes you wonderful and worthwhile. Much better than many ""smart"" people. Some of those people think they are smarter than others, and that's their biggest downfall. All the best."
"School (especially high schools) love to push this idea that if you’re not an encyclopedia that can regurgitate facts at will, you’re not smart. Unfortunately, that’s the ONLY kind of intelligence the school system tests for.

There’s plenty of ways to be smart. It’s not how you memorize, it’s how you LEARN and APPLY your knowledge to your life. The salutatorian from my high school works at a sandwich shop now because he doesn’t didn’t care about applying himself to a higher level job (but he does make a bustin’ sandwich!) 

Intelligence is a lot more subjective than school and society leads you to believe."
"This post is so nice! Those are some thoughts that would benefit a lot of people. Keep it up, we'll do our part as well!"
"I didn’t even need to read the text to know that I think you’re amazing. And highly unlikely to be anything approaching ‘dumb’.

Edit: OK, now I actually read the content of your post and I think you are even more amazing, and even less likely to be anything approaching ‘dumb’. And, if you care about getting more knowledgeable you have so many years to learn things. I’m 45 and not the most academic, but I try to learn all the time because I enjoy it. But if I could switch the knowledge I have and be a better person would I? Yes. 

You are fabulous. Don’t forget it."
"I don't believe in ""dumb"", I think everyone is gifted at something different!"
"Your spelling and grammar are great so I really can't see how you could be genuinely dumb. Besides, as you've identified being kind is more important anyway. People want nice friends not clever ones."
"Knowing a lot of stuff you read in books is nice, but I have met a lot of really smart ass people that can barely do their own laundry, and make choices that screw themselves and everyone around them. 

Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit; wisdom is knowing tomatoes don't go in a fruit salad."
I don't think you're dumb. You obviously have great emotional intelligence and you wrote this post just fine
"Being dumb and not knowing about certain things are not the same.  Albert Einstein didn't know shit about 1970s motown, but that doesn't mean he's dumb.

The fact that you understand the value of being kind shows your far more intelligent than many, many people."
"Please don't ever call yourself dumb. There are so many different types of intelligence and just because you did poorly in school doesn't mean that you are not. Maybe you just didn't find a style of learning that worked for you.

You passed high school and made it into a university that takes intelligence. Having the thought to ride around,  talk  and hold conversations with neighbors/customers, that takes intelligence. 

There are lots of people out there that wouldn't be able to answer those questions. That's why there was a whole tv show based around ""are you smarter than a 5th grader"". 

Intelligence isn't just about how quickly you can answer questions. 

Believe in yourself you are as intelligent as you want to be!"
I wish we could be friends. I feel the same way
"I haven't read other comments to see if they said this,  but you can always work on this. There are free courses and books you can read and if you play trivia enough you will learn all these extraneous facts. Knowledge isn't intelligence, but intelligence helps gather knowledge faster. IQ is the ability to adapt to new situations not the ability to memorize and recite"
"I'm glad that you know you're kind and value that in yourself. However, I have to tell you something: I doubt you're actually that dumb. Everything you wrote here is clear and concise and grammatically correct. You also wrote ""as I lie fully awake."" Almost every time I see this on Reddit people say ""I lay awake,"" which is incorrect. I'm not saying knowing the difference between ""to lie"" and ""to lay"" makes a person smart. But I really think you should revise this assessment of your own intelligence. (Source: me, was a professional writer and editor for 20 years.) I don't think you are dumb. At the very least, please do not use the word ""dumb"" to describe yourself, and please do not give up on yourself and your prospects because you think of yourself this way."
"I think you have a wonderful perspective but I would love to point out that there is a difference between having knowledge and having intelligence. Just because you don't remember or never learned a ""fifth grade fact"" doesn't mean that you don't that the capacity to learn it. I think your heart is in the right place and there is such thing as EQ which is roughly defined as ""emotional intelligence"" which is how well you relate to, empathize with, and can work with a variety of different people. EQ may have a more directly causal relationship with success and happiness than IQ. I've read that it does but I don't have the source, sorry. Meaning that being good with people is AT LEAST as important for overall success as IQ. 

Long story short, OP, is that intellect is NOT fixed. You can continue to learn and grow and the way you navigate the world, with kindness and respect, will serve far more than remembering the 14th president or what RNA does! 

I'm glad you found a healthy perspective, but I would encourage you to try and adopt a growth mindset instead of a fixed mindset with regards to your smarts. All love."
Dumb no. Everyone has a quality that they excel at. You need to find it. Best of luck and godspeed
"I think being happy is one of the hardest things to accomplish in life, and from the way you talk about your life it seems you already know how to do it! My wife is like you in the sence she is and makes people around her happy. It's a rare and fantastic quality to have! I guess my point is that how smart you are (in a scale that society made up) is absolutely irrelevant for the important things in life =)"
"There are different types of smarts in this world. Book smarts aren’t all they’re cracked up to be. I have no doubt it stings to have failed out of uni but try to look at this as an opportunity to change direction. From your post and some of your comments it sounds like you’re much more of a creative person (theater, band, art). You mentioned in one comment that you’re making papier-mâché heads for three friends’ birthdays. That’s absolutely incredible! Explore all you can about the things that interest you and you’ll find that you really are very smart."
"Hey I'm academically smart. But I keep forgetting the food I'm cooking and burning things. So honestly, book smart isn't everything. Just have a nice life"
"I know plenty of people who are very bright but that doesn’t stop them from making stupid choices and mistakes.
You may not have taken in general knowledge and stuff over the years but you have social skills that others don’t care to use. You are kind and do stuff for other people, a lot of people are unkind and wouldn’t do something unless it benefited them.
Your moments self reflection are wonderful. If you want to learn stuff, go ahead, once your brain gets used to learning again, you’re on your way. You can start by reading if you don’t already do so, it is good brain exercise.
I think you’re better than ok."
"Have you heard of the ""Theory of Multiple intelligence""? It basically says that everyone has the same amount of intelligence just distributed into different areas. This has helped me grow past something like what you're going through. 

https://www.verywellmind.com/gardners-theory-of-multiple-intelligences-2795161

P.S. knowledge will rarely fill your life with light and happiness, having good friends and a positive outlook will create a good life."
lol....just because you don't know certain things does not make you dumb. I have met some truly dumb people and the fact that you are able to self reflect and look in ward and think about it shows you  are not dumb. If not knowing something bothers you learn it you will find dumb is very relative term.  I mean I can't spell for shit but I can crunch numbers in my head like nothing else. I am spelling dumb but number smart. We all have our own thing.
"I have a high IQ. It's not all it's cracked up to be and can lead to problems. So long as you're smart enough to learn from mistakes and use sone logic, then that's all the ""smart person"" intelligence you need

On top of that, you have what's known as emotional intelligence, which is very important to have"
"You’re not dumb, you would probably not even be able to contemplate it if you were. People can be clever and thoughtful in various ways. Being nice to people is such a valued trait. You’re smarter than you think."
"It makes me sad you would refer yourself as dumb. I didn't have the easiest time, many have different ways to learn but with the right teachers and patience, anyone can learn anything. And I'm sure you know lots of things that many do not even know! We have knowledge of the things we are passionate about, that we love and care for. And we can always learn, every day we learn new things but some of time we pass it off as nothing. You know what you learned today? That you arent dumb, you have strangers that have complete faith in you, that you are not only kind but capable. Much love and stay kind to yourself apart from everyone else."
"There is a difference between dumb and ignorant, and ignorance can be remedied with education. If you want to use IQ as a measure of intelligence, the vast majority of people fall within a fairly close bracket.

However, people attitude varies a lot more. Some people can be well and truly assholes, while other can be angels. If you are kind and nice, you already have a leg up, you now just have to begin educating yourself.

Another thing I want to say, and some might disagree, Is that nowadays people are concerned with having a shallow knowledge about a lot of topics, and that is considered being a good conversationalist. However you will find that that shallow knowledge is non actionable, i.e. is something that they can repeat, but not something that can be used or has affected their lives in any meaningful way. If you ever consider shoring up your knowledge, there is some basic stuff that you should know, but I would recommend finding something you are passionate about and delving deep.

There is also difference between novel and nuanced. Most people, including me, will shift from one topic to another, as long as it is novel, it is easier to remain interested. However, nuanced is where expertise lies.

In short, I don't think you are dumb, just ignorant, and you can fix that by educating yourself. And if you are nice, then you already have a leg up, because I rarely see an asshole turn into a nice person."
"Interpersonal and social skills ARE knowledge as well. And I’ll leave you with two quotes, the first is from my mom: ‘you can be dumb or you can be a bitch but no one will put with with a dumb bitch’ AND my quote ‘people don’t hire who is best for the job, they hire who they want to work with’ attitude is absolutely everything. You sound like a great person"
"Jewell was right, “In the end, only kindness matters.”"
"Intelligence is much more than just book smarts. Emotional intelligence is something even the brightest of us can lack. If you have the ability to spend time in introspection and think more critically about yourself in the scope of your surroundings, you’re way more intelligent than the average person."
"I think you're missing the most important thing: being a nice person is not something that can be taught, knowledge definitely is.


To give you my example: while living with my parents in a really small town I was pretty isolated and had limited internet access, so couldn't really google random stuff or research things I found interesting. That resulted in me having very little common knowledge compared to my friends. So after a long time of feeling ashamed (like yourself) and finally getting proper internet connection, it was almost like I was catching-up on lost time, I spent nights on wikipedia, going down internet rabbit holes and absorbing all kinds of information I had missed out on. Over the years this led to people actually considering me intelligent and thorough (much to my shock). Though I still avoid playing quiz games as much as possible out of fear of being called out as an ignorant, because often many of the questions are about completely trivial things that I don't really care about.


I don't know why you struggle at school and college, but I find it very hard to stay focussed when I don't care about what's being talked about and just zone out. Obviously this was a problem because I couldn't memorise most stuff taught in classes, except the ones I really liked. So I always had average-ish grades. At work, though, I'm considered a high performer (again, much to my shock due to impostor syndrome), but I consider myself lucky in that regard because I do enjoy my profession and the company I work at.


So, all of this to say that the concept of being ""smart"" is really subjective. A lot of people who you consider smart only appear to be, and are actually as dumb as rocks. It just so happens that they have superficial knowledge about a lot of things, but are often not able to elaborate further. So my advice is: figure out what you really like and dedicate yourself to learn as much as possible about them, try to meet people with the same interests and you'll see how all of a sudden you're not going to feel dumb anymore."
"I can tell you with absolute certainty that you are not dumb, and not because I'm trying to be nice or anything. I have a close friend who dropped out of school and constantly gets shit from his parents for not studying/doing well, and I could tell that in difficult situations, he didn't really have any problem solving skills. But I've known him for a long time and he's one of the most intelligent people I know when it comes to empathy. He would give me all kinds of arguments on why we should give to people on the streets, regardless of what they'll spend the money on. He had a way of justifying kindness that was not contrived, as it came so naturally to him. I always felt so inadequate when it came to being a good person compared to him, and over the past few years, I have become a better person because of it. You might not be smart in the academic sense, but I'm sure you are intelligent in a way that most other people aren't. Give yourself some credit."
"I agree with the positive comments. I'm really smart in the way you mean (lots of degrees and knowledge and so on) but I know I struggle at being kind and I really respect those who can be. I'd rather be friends or date or whatever someone who was kind than someone who was not. In the end it is what's important (cuteness, I'm afraid, sometimes goes as you get older, but kindness is something you should be able to keep)."
There are many types of intelligence. And knowing your blind spots is a certain power in itself...its good to be humble and kind no matter what
"I can completely understand this. I am in my 30's and hate that game. I'm smart but also not at the same time. I am not book or street smart. I know pharmacy, how yo do my job and that's about it. My bf hates when I put myself down, even if it comes so easily to me. My mom always told me I was stupid, or that I couldn't do something. Only in the past year have I realized how smart I am and not to judge myself to others. Because everyone is smart by their own right. My bf btw. He's smart as hell (at least I think so)  he doesn't think hes that smart. When we talk about cars, he has no clue, but then we talk about physics I am dumbfounded.  Get what I mean. You are probably the nicest person around, but you are also smart. Just look for your own. <3"
"You bake which means you can read, understand measurements, and follow directions. That's not dumb. You have emotional intelligence to visit with seniors. That's huge. You recognize that shopping carts need to be returned to the right place--that's awareness and requires thought. Maybe you missed general knowledge in school because things in life were requiring more of your attention. That doesn't mean you're dumb. You have a long life ahead of you, and can catch up with the basics and more. There's no way to go through a day without learning something. Right? Most important, you have a heart, and that means all. Keep growing, and keep being you."
"Based on how/what you wrote here, I do not think you are dumb at all. You can write coherent sentences without mistakes. That is rather the exception. 

Not knowing something does not mean you are dumb. It just means that you have not heard it before or not cared enough to memorize it."
"Stop saying that you're dumb because you're not. You have the most essential qualities for being successful. You will definitely find a rewarding career that you're really good at. The negative things other people say about you don't matter. What they say is assumptive and ignorant, which makes THEM dumb. Stay confident and keep working hard!"
"You are not dumb.

Someone close to me once said, ""we only know what we know and everybody knows something we don't"". 

Good words to live by."
"You're not dumb. Nobody's really ""dumb"". I guarantee that when you find something you're passionate about, you will become an expert in that thing. Everyone has this capacity."
"The point of are you smarter than a 5th grader is that most adults can't easily rattle of the things we're made to memorize as kids, probably because most people haven't used that knowledge since taking a test on it in 5th grade."
I can kind of relate to this. I'm very clumsy and a lot of times I dont really pay attention to my surroundings which has caused me to make a fool of myself multiple times. I even spilled food on myself in a restaurant (luckily a kind stranger helped me clean up!) and I would also trip over myself sometimes and I've walked into plenty of things. So I try to make up for this by being a kinder person and treating the people around me like I would wanna be treated.
"I’ve always said there’s what you do and how you do it.  The “how you do it” is just as important as the “what you do,” but a lot of people shrug that off.

You sound like the kind of person who really cares about “how you do it.”  I think that’s what matters in the long run."
"I’ve always said there’s what you do and how you do it.  The “how you do it” is just as important as the “what you do,” but a lot of people shrug that off.

You sound like the kind of person who really cares about “how you do it.”  I think that’s what matters in the long run."
"Intelligence isn’t just academic. If you know a lot about what you love, like being passionate about band and theater, that’s knowledge! You can pass that on to other people! 

I’m an English teacher, I love the written word and I love teaching children to love reading and writing. But I suck at math more complicated than division and multiplication! That doesn’t make me dumb, it just makes me knowledgeable about something different! 

Being kind is also super important in today’s world. It’s wonderful to know that people like you exist out there!!"
The only way to actually be dumb is to resign to being dumb. I know some people are more naturally talented at doing new things but I’ve seen people who say (and frankly brag about) stuff like “I can’t do ______” without even attempting to guess the odds of success.
"I don't think you're dumb and here's why. When I was a kid, my brother and I were very different. I was excellent in school and had tons of academic knowledge. My brother was the opposite. We'd fight about things and inevitably do what kids do and try to say things to hurt each other's feelings. He'd call me fat and I would go right for the throat and call him stupid. I regret this every day, because now that I'm older, I know it's not true and I most certainly contributed to my brother being an adult who still thinks he's an idiot. 

These days I'm a teacher. Working with kids, I've learned that there are many different types of intelligence, and academics is just one small part of it. My brother works in construction now and he's amazing at it. He can build an entire house. Concrete, framing, electrical, drywall, roofing, all of it. I can't do any of that. He can probably also put an engine together from scratch. I had to watch a YouTube video to do my sparkplugs. His mind just works differently than mine.

There's a quote commonly attributed to Einstein (who may have never said it, tbh) that goes: 

“Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” 

Well, everyone may not be a genius, but through my work, I've come to believe the rest of the quote wholeheartedly. I have a couple college degrees and my brother doesn't even have his GED, but my bro is one smart dude. He's just swimming while I'm climbing. I'm still chubby though. GG bro. Guess you got me there.

At this point, the world needs kind people such as yourself every bit as much as it needs people who are ""smart"" in the traditional sense. Probably moreso. You just need to find your thing and you have plenty of time for that."
"You are right, being decent is more important than being able to withhold a bunch of facts. But if I may, and I hope you read this, one thing I hope you always commit to doing this to growing as a human so if you have to grow, which we all do during the course of our life, you can. Being kind of nice, part of that is going to be having empathy and compassion and being able to see people from other walks of life and not know them but try to expand your respect and feelings. Character matters so much more than so many other things. Just try to be the best person you can always be, and it sounds like you are doing that. You’re going to do great. Thank you for sharing."

"“Intelligence” and “smartness” always comes in degrees and types. I myself attend a school at which the most clever mathematicians will be or de most insane scientist will form, though most of them don’t even now how to operate a washing machine.

What I’m saying is that cleverness at school is not representative for what I think people should consider what it means to be clever or bright. I’m not sure how Freddie Mercury did at school, but hell do I know that as a musician he was BRILLIANT.

And as such I believe every single person has their own talents and interests, which in time develop into they’re own types of being smart. You, I’m sure, are no exception. 

Maybe being nice is the most wonderful type of being smart anyways. You can solve the most difficult equations or compose the most beautiful pieces of music, but who cares if you’re quite unable to relate yourself in a good way to other people? Honestly, that’s not a skill anyone “just” possesses (though I’m sure everyone can learn it) and people will love all the more to be in your presence. Isn’t that what it’s all about, anyways?"
That kind of thinking is positive and relaxing however that positivity might be broken when you come across a difficult situation so it's better to be both kind and competent (not that i believe you are actually dumb) if you are in a place of content it never hurts to try and be better.
"This mantra has made me more confident that I can figure anything out. 

“Practically everything on earth was made for humans. Like it is all made so our brains can sort it out. I have a human brain, how lucky. I can do anything that was made for humans, even if I have to work harder than everyone else. It’s not impossible. I can do anything any other human can do.“"
"You're not dumb. Nobody's really ""dumb"". I guarantee that when you find something you're passionate about, you will become an expert in that thing. Everyone has this capacity."
"If I’ve learnt anything it’s that there are different types of intelligence that can grow your entire life.  I too struggle with a lot of things due to learning disabilities.  I once overheard people that mattered a lot to me talking about whether I was dumb.  It hurt but I realised that it didn’t matter, I know personally my struggles aren’t about understanding or writing but the learning processes itself and not everyone will understand.  At times it feels as though I’m incredibly stupid because of the holes in my memory.  My University units have all been fail or HD.

Your sentiment is very wise and it proves, at the very least to me, that the measure of intelligence is very subjective."
"It sounds to me like you have a lot of emotional intelligence. Caring about the well being of others and the planet (I also pick up trash; I love that you do that) and knowing how to make meaningful connections makes you so valuable to this world. I won't speak for anyone else, but I would take a kind, thoughtful person any day over someone who knows a lot but maybe isn't as kind or thoughtful. This is one of my favorite quotes that I think applies here: 

*I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. -Maya Angelou*

You're important and you have value that is not contingent on what the results of your IQ test would be. You should be super proud to be who you are and not spend another second thinking you are dumb."
All the things you describe are very intelligent things to do! I know a lot of book smart people that can't handle the simplest of tasks. There is all kinds of knowledge and skill levels. Never consider yourself less.
Okay but to be fair what are you ever going to do with the knowledge of how far away the sun is from earth
"I used to think I was dumb, mainly because my parents always treated me as if I was. I also had a hard time in high school and drop out of university. I'm now 28 and realized that I don't do well with the school learning method. I'm not good with theory but I'm excellent with practice. I can't learn from reading, I learn from doing.
And I wanna add, have you ever been checked for ADD or dyslexic? Maybe your problem is something else. But really I don't think you're dumb."
"Intelligence is not being able to pass standardised tests or answer random trivia, there are so many different types of intelligence. 

Emotional intelligence is a grossly underrated quality that not a lot of people have and you should be extremely proud of! A lot of people underestimate just how powerful being kind is, but as someone who has had their day completely changed by having a smile returned by a stranger I can definitely tell you otherwise. Just stay true to yourself and don't force yourself to do something just to meet societies arbitrary standards of idealism. Everyone is different, and emotional intelligence is something which needs to he celebrated, not cast aside!

Just keep being yourself OP, you sound like a wonderful person!"
Dont be so hard on yourself for not knowing some trivia.
"Im a little late here and I’m sure lots of people have already told you that, but NEVER consider yourself dumb because you don’t know a certain subject that people tell you you should know... 

The kind of knowledge you must have to the kinds of things you’re telling us is incredibly valuable as well, it’s irreplaceable, and it’s something no one can teach you but yourself.

I’m about to graduate in med school (which doesn’t make me any better than anyone else, it’s just my example) and I can’t tell you how many times people called me stupid because I was really slow at math and geography... and, well, I still am, but that didn’t stop me from being able to help people with other skills, and I think that’s what matters the most in the end.

“If you judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing it is stupid”"
"Putting away your own shopping cart makes you a better person than like 38% of the people on earth. Putting away others as well, makes you a god damn treasure."
You express yourself well. That indicates some respectable amount of intelligence. Your kindness and thoughtful acts add to your societal value. We could use more people like you.
"I am your cosmic opposite. High IQ and not very kind. At least I wasn't when I was your age. 

A few years ago I realized had I spent as much time learning to be kinder (it is a skill you can sincerely learn) and less time on intellectual pursuits, my middle age would be a LOT better.

You clearly have EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE which is much, much more 'valuable' to employers, better to be around and makes for a better life. This is something I now KNOW. 

I am sincerely glad you came to the realization you did and that you have good friends."
It's never too late to learn. Start reading up on topics that Interest you. Tons of free college classes can be taken online at your own pace. They're not accredited but you can learn all sorts of stuff on your down time.
"Dude! Are you smarter then a fifth grader is intentionally designed to make adults struggle. The questions asked are tailored for the kids. Why would an adult know basis first grade geography? Of course everyone who watches that show is smarter then those kids. It would be like you feel bad because you watched a show called ""Questions about Steve's parents"". Of course Steve is going to win and you might not know his parents but you know a lot of things Steve doesn't

Intellect is relative to the subject. So you thing an electrical engineer is dumb because they don't how to sew? Do you think a biochemist is dumb because they can't build a circuit board? No. 

I can guarantee you know things your friends don't. I can guarantee you have skills your friends don't. And I can guarantee your friends know things you don't and that's ok. Life isn't always about being the best of being the smartest.  Stop comparing yourself to others and focus on yourself. 

Also, don't ever call yourself stupid. Nothing good will ever come from that"
"We used to tease a friend of mine for being ""dumb"". He did goofy things and didn't seem to have a lot of basic knowledge like you mention. Over the years he's become one of my best friends and is one of the kindest people I know. Also while he may not be winning jeopardy, he's intelligent in the things he cares about and we all love him"
"Hey, OP, you aren't dumb!  You type and express yourself well, which already puts you ahead of 50% of the world imo.  Knowing basic things is something you can fix just by taking the time to learn.  Lack of knowledge doesn't mean you're stupid -- it means you weren't very well educated, and you didn't necessarily have control over that as a child (though of course the amount of effort you put in does greatly affect it).  As an adult, you now have absolute control over your own education.  Play that game more, and -- when you find areas that you don't know much about, take the time to educate yourself!  Read books, look stuff up online, or just ask questions from friends and family who know more!  Don't do it to change what anyone thinks about you, do it because you love yourself and you're worth it!  Always remember that lack of knowledge is not something to be ashamed of -- nobody can know everything and everyone has gaps in their education that they (hopefully) fill in over their lifetime.  It's being unwilling to *rectify* that lack of knowledge -- letting yourself stay ignorant -- that is truly worthy of shame.

Also, college is hard for a lot of people that haven't learned good study habits.  If people tell you you're dumb often enough, you may believe it, but that doesn't make it true!  I think you're giving up on yourself (in terms of accepting that you're dumb when that might not be the case) too easily, although I think it's great that you accept and love yourself either way.  People learn in different ways, some people need tutors or different types of classes, but that doesn't make you stupid by any means.

If you genuinely want to know if your intelligence level, go out and get an IQ test -- and not a do-it-yourself test but an honest-to-god test from a professional.  Even then, IQ tests only measure some aspects of intelligence, but it's better than nothing.  I think you might be surprised at the result.

Edit: I wanted to address your actual post a little more -- being a good human does absolutely make up for it imo -- at the end of the day, being good and kind to people is the most important thing.  Just be kind to yourself, too, and that means loving yourself enough to never let yourself coast through life (at least, not for *too* long lol) without improving yourself.  Spiritually, mentally, physically -- whatever way you choose, just remember that putting in careful *consistent* effort will almost always lead to good results long-term."
"Come here, you"
"In my experience I’ve met incredibly smart people. Almost savant level of intelligence. Yes, they’re incredibly smart but they’re also incredibly rude. Are all smart people rude? Absolutely not. 

My point is, just because someone is smart does not mean they are an inherently good person. I would much rather have 1 friend like you than 100 smart friends that are rude. 

You’ve definitely made my morning with this wholesome post. Keep on being you! :)"
"Hey it's much better than being a smart asshole. You're smart in different ways, cherish it"
One thing you need to realize is there is an art to everything. Usually being good at anything or being able to figure things out quickly it takes repetition. You only get better at things by doing them.
"“Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” Albert Einstein."
"“If you judge a fish by it’s ability to climb a tree, it will live it’s whole life thinking it is stupid”"
"I consider myself to be a fairly intelligent person and I enjoy the company of other intelligent people... But 10/10 I would rather spend my time with someone nice and pleasant, regardless of IQ."
"Jimmy Stewart in Harvey:

Years ago my mother used to say to me, she'd say, ""In this world, Elwood, you must be"" - she always called me Elwood - ""In this world, Elwood, you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant."" Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant. You may quote me."
"Anyone who was truly stupid or dumb wouldn't be retrospective enough to realize just how much they don't know. IMO a mark of true (albeit maybe emotional) intelligence is being open to new ideas and the prospect of receiving new information, even if you are afraid that it will challenge what you already know, or that you won't be able to grasp it. ASK real questions to the people around you, especially about things you know nothing about. People who close themselves off to new info, refuse to accept when they are wrong and could stand to learn something, and never ask what they fear are stupid questions are only temporarily preserving their ego instead of allowing for personal growth. You don't strike me as that kind of person. Don't be afraid to look stupid in the process of self-improvement, if it was easy and stylish everyone would do it. Best of luck OP, you are smarter than you realize!"
"Knowing things doesn't make you smart. I am a fountain of information, the ringer on the trivia team, but I do countless stupid things all the time. I know things but I lack wisdom and the older I get the less wise I feel. Don't be hard on yourself. If you want to know more, read and stuff, but you don't need to. Just continue being kind and wise."
"Emotional intelligence is just as important as the other. Both can be expanded on! You certainly do not seem ""dumb"", In any aspect."
I’ve met plenty of highly educated people who lacked some pretty basic life knowledge.  This has ranged from something simple as not knowing you have to clean the dryer vent after every load to something complex like arguing that thanos’ plan to destroy half of all life was the right thing to do.  Don’t get me started on how stupid and temporary that plan was. Probably gonna get downvoted.  Also while I consider myself to be “smart” I often do or say something dumb because I didn’t take the time to think.
"Be nice, keep learning. You’re a good person."
"I don’t know if anyone has posted this already, but there are different skills you can develop that don’t really require a whole lot of book smarts. You already sound like your social/interpersonal skills are well within your strong suit. SO many people struggle with these skills. Just because you’re not the best at one thing doesn’t mean you can’t strive in another."
Dumbest people I know are those who think they're really smart.
I’ve never had an original intelligent thought in my head but I am really happy.  And I’m old!  Being gentle and generous is everything in your real if karma.
"We need more kindness in this world. 

You are valuable for being you!"
"Remembering random facts is just one form of intelligence. And depending what it is that you remember, it might be good for trivia nights but not much else. 

There are so many different kinds of intelligence and often measuring them is quite subjective. Don’t consider yourself dumb but kind. Consider your empathy and helpful actions for the environment and the people around you as emotional and interpersonal intelligence. And value your kindness. My SIL has a wonderful saying: makeup and clothes can make you pretty, but kindness makes you beautiful. 

Check out [this article](https://www.cleverism.com/types-of-intelligence/). I’m sure there are many more like it."
If you feel dumb about something then educate yourself. Take classes. Get a degree. Study. Read. Ask questions. Learn. It’s quite fun :)
Well what’s the point in intelligence if you can’t do any good with it.
"Keep in mind that your interests can play a role in how easily you pick things up. Maybe you just haven’t found that thing that you’re so passionate about that you break through your own perceived limitations and become an expert on. 

In addition to being nice, try out new hobbies and experiences and see if you find something that clicks."
You are a really nice person and It sounds like you have good friends so what if you don't know a few things just be who you are.
"""Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.""

 * Aristotle

Too many people just want to be smart, but it's better to just enjoy life, and spread that enjoyment."
"The mere fact that you are capable of assessing your intelligence and consider it in the context of who you are, means that you are not dumb. There are many types of intelligence, book learning, memory and recall, and problem solving are just a few."
"It has been repeatedly observed that high intelligence DOES NOT correlate with success later in life. Instead, those who were more resilient ended up finding the most financial success. 

Point being, don't put so much stock in intelligence. How smart a person is doesn't mean anything unless you do something with it. And you seem to already be positively impacting the world around you!"
When you are a girl it more than makes up for it
You sound like a sweetheart to me.
I always felt like I didn’t know things until one day I decided to just try and notice things happening/information like that around me and to just make a small mental note of it. Years later I’m quite known as the trivia guy in my group just because I’ve picked so much useless but interesting info up along the way. As much as intelligence does play a role in how quickly you pick the information up. Probably a larger share is just what you expose yourself too and what you actually take the effort to try and remember. That’s just my experience anyway.
"Someone with integrity and no intelligence is beautiful and useful and wonderful still to have in your life.

Someone with intelligence but no integrity is the most absolute danger.

That said, just because you didnt retain academic knowledge doesnt mean you are dumb. Your post is well-written and thoughtful with a lot of wisdom and insight. You probably remember the things that matter really well: stuff about people. Since that's what it seems like you care about most. Who cares if you can name the presidents in order or whatever."
"Being a kind, good person is far more important than being smart. You will find you niche. There is something you are very smart in, but you just haven't discovered that yet. I believe in you."
"Hey, you are an amazing person. Have a wonderful day"
"You sound like a really upbeat and cool person. As someone who usually thinks very poorly of the world around me, it genuinely makes me feel better when I do run into ppl like you...though it isn't often lol, hence the negativity."
"Hey I am in sort of the same boat! I'm not the most attractive woman by any means, but I figure if I can be kind and positively influence someone's life, then I should be just fine :)."
"You're not unintelligent, you just haven't found your place yet. I'm in the same boat. It's easy to feel that way because you didnt retain much of what you learned in school, but that stuff isn't always important. Some people are meant to learn other things, like you and I"
"You don't have to be smart, ignorance is bliss. Work hard, be kind. Being aware is a blessing."
"I used to have a cat who I described as ""really dumb, just spectacularly dumb, but good at other things "" And she was! And I loved her so much! She was more loving and sweet and affectionate and gentle than any other cat I'd ever known, and I was just devoted to her.  I know you aren't a cat, but people are good at different things. Some are smart, some are physically competent, some have amazing emotional skills. You don't have to be good at everything to make a positive mark on the world.

That said, you can learn some basic facts that will help you make good decisions.  Everyone should know the basics of how their government works, and their country's history or you get into the mess that...ahem... some places are in today.  You just have to find a book or a teacher who really speaks to you, and you have to decide that it's important.  Tell yourself that it's so you can be more knowledgeable in your compassion and actions, and I know you can do it."
"If you don't want to be ""dumb"" don't settle. It's fine if high school wasn't easy and you didn't make it in uni. That doesn't make you dumb. It probably means you don't learn as easy or the same way as others. Now you know this about yourself. 

If you want, you can make it your goal to figure out how you learn best. Once you understand how _you_ learn you can go learn anything you want. It doesn't have to be fast either. You have the rest of your life to learn what you want. Don't sell yourself short."
I don't know you so I can't say if you are dumb. All I can say is that truly dumb people don't think they are dumb. They think their opinion is the right one and that they know enough to make confident claims about anything. So just by realizing that there are a lot of things you don't know you are already ahead of many MANY people.
"My philosphy is that there is no one on this planet that i cannot learn something from.  So even if you think you are ""dumb"" in the book learning and general knowledge sense, i am sure that there are 1000 things you could teach me.  About being nice, giving of myself,  being attentive to others.  Have you thought about a career in the caring fields?  You would probably be fantastic in care of the elderly or the disabled.  And you could study for a qualification while you worked, if you want to go that route. Otherwise , you keep doing you, knowing that every day you are making someones life a little brighter"
The only dumb people are those who stop learning and improving
Wisdom should never be confused with intelligence. Being book smart is not as valuable as making good life decisions. It sounds like you have made some good choices. It doesn’t matter if you know which body of water borders on Albania.
"I am so sorry.  Nobody should be judged by their knowledge.

You are obviously a great benefit to society.  You should be proud.

If you really want to feel ""educated"" I suggest you get an abridged encyclopedia and read it.  Don't feel like you have to read and know every section.  If something doesn't interest you, don't feel bad about skipping it.

You can always message me."
You sound really nice. I am so glad you have good friends. *hug*
"Whenever I feel dumb I just remember that so was Forest Gump, but he did just fine off of just trying his hardest"
"I kinda relate to this since i feel most of my friends outsmart me, but i usually limit myself with this mindset. I dont have the obligation to be nice, but i force myself to do so because i sometimes believe thats the only reason people put up with me. 
Maybe its just my insecurities, but i dont enjoy feeling like i have to be kind and caring all the time just to be respected. I dont have to make up for my flaws. I dont have to be the kindest person in the world, even in situations that make me uncomfortable, just to feel like a decent person.
Dont get me wrong, I think its great that you know and accept your strengths and weaknesses just as they are, but sometimes i forget im not obliged to act a certain way, and i think its important to remember that."
"So while they were studying, you were busy helping others selflessly. This certainly doesn’t sound very dumb to me."
"That's actually the reason I liked a girl so much once. I was not reciprocated, but but it can't be helped. Please don't stop being kind! I'm sure you understand a lot about the things you love to do."
"An expert in their field is just that. An expert in their field. Outside of the their field, you may consider them ""dumb"". There is too much knowledge for someone to know everything. From the little you said, you probably have great emotional intelligence, something many people seem to lack (and something I'm constantly trying to improve myself)"
"Girl, let me tell you I don’t think you’re dumb. Intelligence comes in many forms, some people are good at retaining knowledge from classrooms, some people aren’t. I’m the former; I was never able to quite get the hang of lecture based learning, and was often treated as dumb throughout school. I did struggle in college but I worked my ass off until I found something I really enjoyed, and even though I still struggled in classroom settings, now that I’m graduated and out in the real world I’m consistently one of the best in my field because what I chose is something I really enjoy and put in the effort to know it well. Don’t get me wrong, it took me a good amount of practice to really learn stuff, but that’s normal. Some people are better at retaining knowledge and getting things than others, but most people struggle through school, they just learn methods of education that benefit them personally.

My point is, being “dumb” isn’t really a thing. There was a time in my life I could barely spell correctly. I went to a small town school that didn’t have the best educational system, so that certainly didn’t help. I ended up learning almost all of my grammar and spelling through online games. All it took was practice. That’s when I realized that I just didn’t learn well in the classical lecture format. I actually do better when I ignore the professor altogether and learn on my own. Being dumb just means you don’t know the things commonly taught in school, but nobody started out knowing any of those things. It’s all something you work at to learn. I would suggest finding something that makes you happy, and potentially looking at careers where you can do that for a living.

You have a great attitude though, I think you can do anything you set your mind to with enough practice. Just remember, they say you need to put in 10,000 hours of something to truly master it. Find that thing you love and start mastering!"
Your roommate was a jerkface. Also check out multiple intelligences. Everyone is smart in their own ways.
"Your ability to write clearly and coherently, expressing complex ideas through multiple sub-clauses, indicates that you have significant language skills. I suspect you are also good at conversation. In my experience, dumb people don't handle complex language very well. You are probably a lot smarter than you realize, just not particularly knowledgeable. That's a very different thing, and a lot easier to change. :) You're doing great."
"I don't think it's fair to call yourself ""dumb"". You've just come to realize there are some basic things you don't know. That's fixable. It's also good that you're self-aware enough to recognize it.

What the hell, here's ""A Brief History of Time"" by Stephen Hawking if you want to dive right in:

"Just because you can’t spit out facts on command doesn’t mean you’re not smart. My 18 year old daughter is one of the smartest people I know, but she is *terrible* at test-taking. Like, really *really* bad. Even when she knows what she’s doing she just bombs tests. But that doesn’t make her dumb. There are so many ways to be smart in this world, don’t sell yourself short! :-)

And you do sound like a really good friend and a great person overall."
"Kindness is by far the most important thing in this world. By far. Like not even close. People don't realize this until it's too late.

Think about it like this - would the world be a better place if everyone was super kind or if everyone was super intelligent?"
That's wholesome. Also don't think you are dumb. Everyone is smart their own way and there are many ways you can improve your knowledge
You sound brilliant.
"You sound lovely. There are many kinds of intelligence, but compassion is the most valuable one. :). Many different kinds of memories too that value different things."
"Don't feel bad. Those kinds of games are engineered to grab your attention and make you feel inferior. [It's the same thing with commercials.](https://youtu.be/oOlJ_jCLHmo)

Just do your best. It seems obvious from what you wrote here that you're a decent human being. If you want to expand your knowledge, go ahead."
"Well you seem to be a happier, more well rounded person than a lot of people. It seems like your strength is your EQ (emotional intelligence) rather than IQ, which is great, people like you are as necessary in the world as people with high IQs.
You should acknowledge your strengths and focus on them, don't live thinking that you are dumb. But, at the same time, keep trying to improve yourself, acquiring skills, knowledge etc.
Wish you the best!"
This would be a good book ngl
"I was just saying how that game is just trivia. Intelligence is measured in so many different ways. It sounds like you’re very emotionally intelligent, and you probably are in a lot of other ways too! Not knowing facts is far from not having capability."
I know someone just like you in real life and tbh you are the best kind of people to know and you make this world a better place so please dont bother about your knowledge :D
You need to know that your post make me want to be better. You must be a great friend.
You’re articulate. Everybody has a set of skills. Improve what you don’t like and create the ones you don’t have.
This is so cute
"I know this isn't a lot but motivational youtube videos helped me a lot. There is one, but unfortunately I cannot find it or have the time now as I have like 1 week left until my final exams, that one video with David Goggins that says something along the lines people told me I am smart, I said: ""no, no, no, don't say that. I am a dumb motherfucker. I will go out there and change that.""  The point was he was never ever going to give up and he went to truly transform himself. Maybe this will help you along your journey."
"So it sounds like you got the most important things in life down.  It doesn't matter what you know, it matters how you treat people. And I always go back to what my mom always said. ""Treat others the way that you would want to be treated.""
The best part of it is that now you are an adult. And you can brush up on school subjects at any time. Or, you could learn things that interest you. There are few people in the world who are knowledgeable about everything. But the rest of us just try to be knowledgeable in one thing!"
"That's true, being a good person is way more important, or being funny, or fun to be around, or being a good listener, but just because you don't know certain facts from highschool doesn't mean you're dumb!  Some really intelligent people don't learn that way, and there are tons of ""geniuses"" who can't get anything accomplished, therefore it doesn't even matter. You can easily memorize facts if you choose to, but I'd say just learn things that are practical! Geography, history, math, science, all interesting and good things, but like exercise, you have to address it in a way that motivates you. Also, the insight you've shown is a type of intelligence, self-awareness, etc. too. You'll meet ppl who don't have that ability to self-reflect, and see how much it stunts them!"
That sounds pretty wise
Gurl same
"I seriously doubt that you're ""dumb"". We all learn at various degrees from different sources. You'll find things that interest you and you will for some reason struggle to learn about that from a specific source. Then you come across another source which uses a different medium or platform and you will have an easier time learning from it. Some learn from reading, some from hands-on doing examples of what they are reading, some from images or videos. Many things are simply learned by repeating (a lot!) and finally memorizing it. It also highly depends on other factors such as amount and levels of stress and sleep.

I don't feel ""dumb"" myself, but for certain subjects, I feel clueless until I reach a certain level of knowledge. At that point it sort of all clicks at so many levels and I can usually even start teaching in that subject. I've given lectures in various media/web/design/programming subjects for corporations, high-schools and unis. 

What's more important though, is that you have empathy and emotional intelligence. That'll come handy for getting liked, contacts and experiences needed for paving your own success.

You're young and still have a long journey ahead of you where you'll learn tons along the way. No rush. No pressure. 

Cheers, high-fives and fistbumps from Stockholm, Sweden!"
"Wow you’re literally my ideal woman, let’s meet and get married one day maybe?"
Helo
Anybody can learn new things! Just because you think you're dumb or unintelligent doesn't mean you are! You can always keep improving and learning new skills and stuff you just gotta try!
You're already ahead than most of us. Don't worry about your perceived intelligence.
"There are many different types of intelligence, so what if you’re not as book smart as others. Knowing basic knowledge doesn’t make you a good person as you’ve said and it’s a good thing that you know that. Lastly, it is much easier to learn some basic knowledge than it is to learn how to be a kind and caring person, so I think you’re going to be alright."
"Thank you very much, I guess you are right, I’m smart about the things I care about . And I genuinely love learning about things that I actually have interest in. I really want to move to a City so I can have more opportunities to try new things and do workshops and just test the waters in things that aren’t available in a small town."
Well said
This 100%
"I think people tend to think they're either dumb or smart, no in between. In reality, I feel like there's many forms of intelligence (emotional, social, logical, etc.), and it's a spectrum. 

I totally agree that you can become more intelligent in your lifetime as well. That being said, I'm not very smart either lmao"
Read. It will open your mind and introduce the world to you.
"I'm not saying whether she is dumb or not but how can you be sure and say ""this is not true"" without knowing the person and just based on one statement?"
wow thank you very much! this comment opened up a new little perspective for me. I always just figured I love when people “make my day” so I wanna try make as many other peoples days hah
"Right? All the biggest companies and their largest shareholders and/or CEOs tend to be pieces of shit that actively make the world worse for regular people. OP shines a bright light through their community, directly making the immediate society better."
"Thank you! I feel like what motivates is to be extra kind is my own best friends. Sure they would never do anything to hurt anyone’s feelings, but then go on for lengths about not caring about other people out of their immediate circle or saying how much they judge people (we are a very open and talkative friend group) and I  feel like people about my age get a bad rap about being rude so I like put in the extra effort."
"Came to say this - we have a saying that goes ""Those who don't know, but know that they don't know, they are gonna get there one day - those who don't know and don't know that they don't know, welp, welcome to endless ignorance"""
That’s so funny I just bought a newspaper for the very first time because I have three friends birthdays coming up in two weeks and I’m making them paper mache piñatas of their own heads filled with little gifts and candy. Sounds weird but I thought it would be funny and I would get some good reactions to them hah. I’ll definitely give it a read before making them :) thank u!
"Thank you! At the moment, I am taking some basic online classes to learn coding, I’m so far I’m having a really fun time so it makes it like ten times easier to actually focus and remember stuff and so far I’ve reached out to some people I know who code for some help and I get what you mean about not being the nicest hah"
"I’m also fresh out of dropping out of university because I failed all of my first year classes, but I didn’t want to mention that in post I don’t know why."
"Honestly I think you hit it pretty much on the nose. Thinking about it now, and id hate to get all deep and sad, but my mom has never ever told me she were proud of me, even with things I thought I did pretty well in so I always just assumed I wasn’t doing good enough. And like I said I dropped out of uni, and that took a very big toll on what I thought, because leaving high school I thought I was pretty good at most subjects, then having to drop out because I flunked all my uni classes... not fun. Thank you very much for bringing this up."
"Oh my goodness you really got me on the fixed mindset thing. Thinking about it now most stuff that I get upset about myself, can be fixed. A lot of it is because even though I’m 20 I feel like I should be all grown up and know everything and I should know what I want to do in my life and I always make decisions as if they are my final decisions that can’t be changed. Thank you so much for bringing this up and reminding me:)"

"Luckily my favourite subject in school was English and I passed my exams with some of the highest grades but when I went to university, I realized how much my high school teachers did not prepare me for writing university essays and ended up failing most of my essays :/ but also a lot was my fault too because I’m not the best at asking for help, I’d rather try and fail one hundred times then bother someone to explain stuff to me."
"I try not to let people take advantage but I’m a very “ill do whatever” or “I’m okay with doing whatever” type of person and even when things start to bother me, I just let it keep bothering me and bothering and there’s been a couple of times everything just back fires and blows up in my face. I definitely need to set more boundaries up for helping others so it doesn’t affect me negatively hah but thank you for your comment!"
"Years ago my mother used to say to me, she'd say ""In this world Elwood""- she always called me Elwood - ""In this world Elwood, you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant."" Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant. You may quote me."
Thank you very much!! :)
"Thank you so very much! By complete coincidence, my three very best friends are all diagnosed with severe mental health issues and recently I’ve come to realize and appreciate how lucky I am to have a clear mind and to be able to smell the roses on cloudy days. Sure I’ve had my bad weeks and days but I find making other people happy is an instant way to make myself happy:)"
"this made me cry such big happy tears. that was super nice to hear, thank you so very much."
"Thank you so much! You know, now that I’ve talked about it and heard some feedback it made me realize how silly it is to be so sad for a week about not knowing    stuff like What the closet planet to the sun is or how many states are in the USA despite living in canada hah"
Well said.
"I think that not knowing things doesn't necessarly make you dumb, there are many ways a person can be considered smart in my opinion"
"Hi! I think you are amazing :) From your other comments I can tell you put in extra effort to make people’s day and that it doesn’t cost you much energy on a personal level and that’s wholesome, good and lovely!

I highly recommend taking an interest in speech and communication - through books, YouTube and/or classes.

Now let me tell you whyyy. 
Studying communication and speech will do two things for you: help you connect with people even more, and help you understand and hopefully move past future pain(s).

Story telling:
I was in a park with my best friend. We were watching family friend’s kids play tag and one of the youngest kids was it(he musta been around 6yrs old). He was pumping his little legs as fast as he could (which wasn’t really that fast considering his size) trying to chase his sister when ... he tripped over his own foot and hit the grass face first. My heart stopped.

A moment that seemed like an eternity passed... then the boy got up and started running again like nothing ever happened :D

Right away I turned to my friend and we both bursted out in laughter. “Did you see that?” “ He was so cute!!” “I’m pretty sure he has some grass up his nose xD”

Being able to share a moment with a friend and connect is what life is about. Moments like that are much more special and important than being smarter than a fifth grader :). Communicating through storytelling and other media only helps in that aspect, in my humble opinion.

In regards to protecting yourself: I think you have amazing friends and are very fortunate. You discovered that you didn’t know some things and your friends did not make you feel bad about it. Those are some good friends.

Unfortunately one day you will be hurt by someone, whether it is a friend, family member or significant other. You’ll go through something like you did this week where you will struggle with the idea you are not good, or smart, or some other negative perception. Learning conflict resolution and specifically the art of asking open ended questions will help you clarify those moments. Some of the time it’ll just be a misunderstanding, and unfortunately some of the time it’ll actually be something mean spirited. But I want you to stay wholesome and good and genuine, so please don’t let misunderstandings bring you down. I hope the mean spirited moments also won’t bring you down, but unfortunately they are a part of life.

If none of this interests you that’s fine, I’m glad you are who you are and just continue to play to your strengths :)"
"I've gained more knowledge since I left school than I ever learnt in school. Not just related to the field I'm working in.

These days with all this information at your fingertips its a blast learning new things :)

Dumb people are people that refuse to learn, people that discriminate and hate based on how much melanin you have in your skin or who you fall in love with.

*Those*, those are some real dumb shits

EDIT: Typos"
"I personally think the greatest mark of intelligence is self-awareness, and awareness in general. You don’t have to be clever or quick to be intelligent, you just have to be awake."
"You are mistaking knowledge for intelligence. And there are different kinds of intelligence. Don't mark yourself down for that.

One of the janitor ladies in my hospital unit is like this. Always putting herself down. Always being the most giving and caring. Pulling the whole unit together as a family. 

The truth is that she is as essential to the team, as the doctors themselves. And thankfully people are intelligent enough to appreciate her. 

So my advice is to find a group that appreciates you and your qualities, if you havent already. And less thoughts about how dumb you are. This post proves that you aren't."
"Intelligencw is very fluid, just because you aren't great at remembeting trivia doesn't mean you aren't great at something else. Play to your strengths :) And if you got into uni it can't be all that bad"
"Here’s the thing about “are you smarter than a fifth grader”... it quizzes you on most useless trivia that’s long since left your memory, it’s designed to make adults look and feel “dumb” for not knowing certain things that there’s no real reasonable expectation of you having committed to memory. Hell I earned a bachelors degree with honors and held a 4.0 through my masters program and I do horribly at that game too. 

What you said in this comment is the most important thing: you’re smart about the things you care about, combine that with being a genuinely nice person and you’re not dumb at all."
I bet your really good at your job with the attitude you carry :-)
"I had a feeling you'd be a small towner! If you do ever move to a big city, just don't let it change you.. I've lived in a few across several countries, and the one thing that is common in all cities is there's a lot more openly unfriendly behaviour than in towns. Hope you can brighten them up!"
"And you know, realising you have short comings in knowledge is a good thing, because we all do. I'm queen of the quiz night but still learn things every day that I feel embarrassed I didn't know. So many people don't know much about the world because they DON'T CARE, and its those wilfully ignorant people that are unbearable, because they also think they're always right (see Dunning Kruger effect). You can learn these things quickly and fairly easily really because it's always good to know about the world around you. But knowing stuff does not equal intelligence likewise neither does not having come across some information before mean you're unintelligent. Display curiosity about the people and world around you and it will come, as will people's respect."
"Being thoughtful and kind of takes a lot of awareness and intelligence. So you’re not book smart and you don’t memorize things, but you keep in mind what would make the world better and will make people feel good and to me that’s a far more important level of intelligence."
"Being “smart” applies to so many different scenarios. Sure you might not be interested in memorizing facts about history or whatever, but you can be exceedingly intelligent about how to be a kind person in daily life. This requires a different type of intellect that, frankly, a lot of people don’t possess."
Being able to acknowledge the things you don’t know and strive to learn about them sounds quite smart to me.
There is a big difference between being intelligent and smart/well educated. I know a shitton of people who graduated from the best universities in my city but are still dumb as fuck. You may have a lack of basic knowledge but you are emotionally intelligent. And that’s often way more worth!
"I’m just going to lay it out there:

In order to succeed at life, you need one or more of the following: looks, genuine kindness, brains. 

According to your obnoxious roommate, you’ve got looks. 

According to your self-assessment, you’re also kind. 

Reading between the lines, you *also have the brains.* You’re knocking it out of the park, kid. 

Instant recall of facts is not intelligence. It’s regurgitation of trivia. There are many forms of intelligence and you have it in spades. Playing an instrument, participating in theatre, recognizing needs in the community and meeting those needs, and social skills? You’re a rock star. Further, you have a *desire to learn more,* which is more than I can say for most people I’ve met in life. 

I understand the frustration of being in a small town with few resources for personal development. The Internet is your friend, here. 

Khan Academy online is free. It started off as a math tutoring resource but has expanded to include social studies and science in bite-sized lessons. 

TED Talks online, also free. Experts in every imaginable field give short presentations on their specialties. It’s a great way to add variety to your perspective. 

There are affordable options for learning languages, computer skills, business management, etc., and self-paced to fit in when you have time outside of the workday. 

Also, college straight out of high school is NOT for everyone. I tried and failed right after my senior year because I had zero help in planning and no academic advising. Took a break, knocked out a few credits part-time at the local community college, and went on to get my BA and MA at university, each with a 4.0. The school that works for one person might be a horrible fit for another. The school that doesn’t work for you now might be perfect for you three years from now. Your experience is not necessarily a reflection of your abilities, is my point. 

Cut yourself some slack. It might just not be your time to bloom, academically. In the meantime, keep doing your thing. As long as you’re growing, you’re doing great."
I moved from a small town to Los Angeles when I was 25. It was a great decision. The amount of things to do and get involved in is huge.
"You’ve hit the nail on the head when you said ‘I’m smart about the things I care about’. When you have an interest in something or a natural affinity for it, you will want to learn about it and become ‘smart’ in that topic. As for the rest, if it doesn’t interest you or you don’t ‘need’ to know it, don’t stress about it! I can tell from your comments that you write really well, and you obviously communicate well and easily build a rapport with people. Those are huge skills that some of the ‘smartest’ people in the world lack! These are skills that will get you far in life, whether it’s in a work context or in your personal life. I think you’re amazing!"
"""I'm smart about the things I care about"" says it all. That pretty much is true for everyone. Your attitude is amazing. The world needs more people like you."
"Because most people are not dumb, they are ignorant"
"I'm glad I've paid forward a bit on behalf of the people you will have cheered up.

Very few people will end their lives having wiped out a virus or cured world hunger. The best the rest of us can do is make the days of those around us a pleasure to live through. It sounds like you're at the top of the game :-)."
That’s quite a lengthy saying
"That idea sounds so cool! There seems to be a lot of redeeming qualities you have!

Now, I wanna make a papier-mâché model of my friends’ heads and stuff it with memories and gifts!"
Not the person you replied to but what coding language are you learning if you don't mind me asking?
"Hey, I'm a professional programmer!! I've been doing this for 9 years. It can be a tough job, but it's a lot of fun!  I think the hardest part is there's some much information out there and it's constantly changing. I have to look up simple stuff all the time! (OK, Google, how do I add a style sheet again...)

But having people skills is so important. I thought I was going to work in a box and be alone most of the day but that couldn't be further from the truth. Im constantly talking to coworkers, project managers, vendors, clients, end users.... it's definitely a people driven job. Computers are your tools, but it's for people.

Anyway if you have any questions or need any advice feel free to reach out any time! Good luck!"
"I failed out of college when I was 18 then went back 10 years later and couldnt believe how easy I found all the basic classes to be this time. I never thought myself to be that smart but i was finding that I thought a lot of the 18-19 year olds really weren't that smart either. Maybe give yourself some time, you'll be alright"
"College is a whole different animal, and people have trouble there because of the structure. Many new students have to get a tutor to help them bridge gaps because not everyone’s high school covered the same things. You might try it again later, if it’s something you want, when you’re feeling more confident and be a little more aggressive about it. In the meantime, you’re very articulate and thoughtful. You can’t be both of those things and also dumb. You may be ignorant of some facts - we all are, no worries, fact are easy to look up."
"Growth is in your nature. It is a part of your adherent being. You are not a fixed object or person. You are in a perpetual state of growth and development everyday. From there you have some control over your own growth and the direction it takes. 

So I'm getting ready for a new position at work and I am nervous about it because elements of my job dont come as easy to me as they do to most. This has been experience over the last 17 years. From there I cant control my ability or inability to absorb or retain the information. So it is easy for me to fall behind others. So when it came time for promotional exams and what not I had to work what I felt was way harder than the others. This has actually been a strong suit for me in my life. 

I was never the 'smart kid' and because of that I decided I was going to be the working hard kid. This actually has impacted how I do lots of things. 

Rather than rambling on and on...check out this short video it will really help you! Please watch it. It's only 5min.

https://youtu.be/NWv1VdDeoRY"
Says the person who just creeped on my comment history. Good move.
"The whole ""Am I smarter than a fifth grader?"" part reminds me of Seth Sentrys song ""Dumb"". In that song he realizes he's dumb in the exact same way hahah 

Either way, attitude is basically everything. I don't think that you can possibly be as dumb as you think you are, if you've got enough self-insight to realize there's room for improvement. Socrates and Einstein both said something along those lines."
This whole post made me smile and started my day with a positive note. Thnaks and good luck with everything!
"The only thing that makes someone dumb is if they're unwilling to learn. 

A willingness to learn and adopt new principles or ideas makes you as smart as anyone else in my opinion."
So much this.  There is a reason wisdom and intelligence are two different stats in D&D.
"yes there are manu subcategories to being an intelectual, one of which is watching anime or having an anime waifu, u def dont need brains for that just big dick energy"
Thank you so very much for this long and thoughtful comment! I swear I’ve read it through at least four times now hah. just found this subreddit a couple hours ago and wasn’t expecting very much but this all helped me a lot!  I will definitely look into speech and communication because I think most of the time I know what I want to say (in conversation) but I don’t know how to say it and it ends up all jumbled up. Again thank you very very much:)
">And there are different kinds of intelligence.

Yes this is important to remember. Even beyond intellectual intelligence, there is social intelligence and emotional intelligence. I'd much rather spend time with someone who has those latter two than someone who is just book smart."
"There are so many types of intelligence, yes!

I have a friend who suffered brain injury while he was being born. He struggles a lot with basic math, spelling, and so on. However, he is the most gifted and skilled illustrator I've ever met. His talent is breathtaking. In addition, he's extremely kind and patient. Now he teaches art to kids.

Everyone has something to contribute. It's only our culture that doesn't seem to recognize that."
"Actually.. not to toot my own horn again, but I really am! I just started working part time as a cashier and part time at a daycare, because I wanted more time to practice coding and not feel so burnt out all the time working full time daycare. And our store is doing this online survey thing for extra points and so far, in the two weeks I’ve been working I’ve gotten so many nice comments online! And it makes me so happy to hear :) I was a little scared to go back to working a retail job after trying uni, I don’t know why but it’s going really good to far and it’s fun taking to human other than toddlers and infants hah"
"Well I’m just starting with the edx intro to computer science just to get a feel if that’s something I could go for, and I’m currently learning C but I would say it’s going very good for now hah"
Wow that’s awesome! There’s not much to find online about what the job of a programmer is all like but that’s sounds cool hah. Thank you:)

"The thing is, you don't \*have\* to know trival facts. I can't think of an English term for it, but you are not dumb, you just ""don't have broad horizons"", if that makes sense?   
If you never had any interest in history and geography, then it not surprising, that you don't know about it, but nor does this make you any better or worse as a person.  


I consider myself quite ""smart"", as in I know things and I know how to look things up. But I still jumble up my thoughts, as what and how I think is completely different thing from what I say :P.  


As for the Uni, the times where we believed that ""if you don't go to Uni you are stupid"" are over now. I have a Master's degree and with it came the life lesson of prolongued unemployment. It is good as in it teaches you how to think, but dropping out does not make you stupid anymore than having a uni degree makes people smart."
Yes! This so much. I'll never forget watching a documentary on highly autistic people who had 0 social skillz but could draw entire cities from memory or beat out graphic calculators in their head. The brain compensates when an area is lacking. Just gotta find out what part of yours is extra developed ^^
"Being good at, and enjoying, your job is also a wonderful gift. It took me a long time to find work that I wasn't anxious about. I managed to find a wonderful and very calm boss who has taught me how to relax and not worry. I find that I enjoy it more because I know I can do it."
"That's a pretty good way to start. I would also recommend looking up courses on Udemy once you get an idea of what you want to learn. I started learning web development and game development, and it's really enjoyable. Coding is going to seem overwhelming at first but if you stick with it, it will get easier. Just don't give up!"
"It's *awesome* that you're starting with C. It's where I tell everyone to start because it creates opportunities to really drill in the fundamentals and develop good code-writing practice. One of the best things about starting with C is that it's very easy to transition to pretty much any language afterwards (at least that's been my experience).

Just remember there's a reason C gets a reputation for being hard to begin with and a lot of people shy away from it -- it's okay to struggle and find it hard -- literally everyone does.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions! I've written my fair share of code in the C language of families (I still prefer writing embedded code in C and application code in C#) and would be glad to help out!"
"That too, but also because you can be really stupid and know lots of things, or you can be really smart and not know much."

A decoy book works very well
The USMLE book. The person is definitely aiming to become a medical doctor. It’s a brutal exam.
How do you get anything done with those eyes judging your every move?
Cat's gonna make step 2 pass/fail
He’s a good boy! Give him anything he wants.
Your cat looks extremely well mannered.
It's acquiring knowledge
"Ah yes, my trap card...

*C A T T O*"
"Ahw. I needed this, how cute :)"
Mine will sit on a single sheet of paper.
New surfaces. Must put my butt on new surfaces.
Halo lituanian
That cat looks like Garfield.
Now I miss having a cat
He's definitely judging you.
Lol whenever I'm on my phone my cat will headbutt it out of my hand and nibble on the corner like chill lol
"I have to leave the laptops partial open. Closed, they sits. Open, they sits."
"Why, though?"
Cats on Minecraft chests be like
She looks like the drummer girl in Scott Pilgrim vs the world
He said >: <
So thats how you summon a cat
"If it fits, I sits I guess"
Try smaller and smaller things please!!!
Good kitty. Just keeping your book warm so you don't get cold hands.
"Keep in mind, Step 2 is 3/4 molecular biology. Good luck!"
I feel this is some sort of sneaky MacBook flex somehow
"Or putting uncomfortable items on objects you don’t want cat butt on. 

My laptop is often a target for kitty sitting. I put a tv remote and a few other items on it. Definitely discourages cat activity"
But can this cat eliminate CS?
What is there to flex?
Surely the bigger flex would be the fact that those are med school books lol
My cat would view that as a dare
My cat would just push everything off.
Honestly it was just a joke... apparently a bad one but oh well

"Don't stick'em with the pointy end, it doesn't really do much."
"Ned Stark: Stabbed once in the leg, bedridden for weeks, walked with a limp till his death. 

Drogo: Got a small cut, gets infection, dies. 

Robert Baratheon: Gored in the stomach by a boar, nothing Westerosi medicine can do to save him. 

Talisa: Stabbed repeatedly in stomach, dead a few seconds later. 

Arya: Stabbed repeatedly in the stomach then swims in dirty canal, fine by the end of the episode. 

That was probably the moment the show jumped the shark."
Game of Thrones taught me that milk of the poppy and a good night's rest will cure you of multiple stab wounds to the abdomen.
"Sansa is the smartest person I know, she'll tell me how to avoid death"
"Up until season 7, I was hoping that Syrio and Jaqen would make appearances again somehow. But then I realised that they would be much better off not appearing on the show again."
"When I saw that scene I thought ""oh shit, she is gonna need some kind of magic healing to survive this obviously fatal wound""

Nope, just some bed rest."
Remember in the penultimate episode Arya (somehow) is the only survivor of Drogon’s wrath on kings Landing and sees a white horse that she gets up on and rides OUT OF THE TOWN only to be standing on her own 2 feet back in the town with no white horse on sight in the following episode. WHAT?!?
"""wHaTs WeSt Of WeStErOs"""
"Ah, whereas Jorah’s jelly armour gets pierced through the chestplate with obsidian to the heart, and Theon gets impaled with a wooden spear through multiple inches of steel"
"It's hard to see, but when she falls off the bridge into the river she actually jumps over a shark."
"It was worse than just plot armor, at least in the end of season 6. They just straight up had NO idea where to go with that story without source material so they threw in some random dramatic scenes to close it out and get people to gasp without the actual inspiration. I noticed this drop in quality at the end of season 5 with Jon snows death but I remember her getting stabbed was when a LOT more people got on board that the writing went into the toilet."
"Man seeing this just makes me sad. This story is amazing, and the early seasons of the show rock."
"As much as I adore the actress.  Arya was easily the most irritating character in terms of plot armor, and unrealistic levels of OP'ness."
She's lived for longer than she can remember because of a run in with The Doctor.
"Last Kingdom seems to be very similar to Game of Thrones in the sense of having unexpected things happen and actually being surprised by them.

I would say Last Kingdom Seasons 1 - 4 is like Game of Thrones Season 1-4 except quite a bit faster paced . (every season is  + 2 years ,  I will say this is probably its only fault, that the pacing can actually be a bit too fast.

The last kingdom is far less fantasy though, this can be good or bad, while there is magic, its far less globally poweful and more balanced. no dragons.

Season 1 and Season 4 has about 10-15 years difference

Of course game of thrones is probably more epic and a preferred show to many, but Last kingdom is in my opinion far better than vikings and definitely still worthy of watching it."
"Jon’s snow dead and revival was the moment the show went downhill, and it’s going to cause a lot of problems in the books too."
"Wasn’t it a relatively minor wound that killed the Hound in the books, over time, because...that’s how wounds work?"
That’s what Ned thought.
"You remember Bessie, don’t you Bobby B?"
[deleted]
"Idk dude, GoT smashed tf out of plot armour off the bat. Although later on it really held."
What?!  The fine print of Milk of the Poppy doesn't read: Works like Fix-a-flat for your car!?
"Is there a movie where the protagonist fully embraces that he has plot armor and does all sorts of stupid shit that would normally get him killed, but doesn't... because he has plot armor?"
"Flip off, Deathmaister!"
Statues in the back got some action though
What they did to her hurt the most.
"Which is nuts, as he was getting stabbed"
"I hope somebody got loosed for that blunder

FTFY"
I'm enjoying this. It's a dramatic difference.
I'm just glad poor Bobby B wasn't around to see how it all turned out.
But did you gasp?
And then she jumped into a sewer. With an open fucking stomach wound.
Her neck should have gone “snap” when the NK grabbed her. That would actually surprise us.
"I recently underwent appendicitis and the thought of walking, let alone running, a few days after the laparoscopy with merely 7 (2+2+3) stitches made me sweat. Believe it or not, I remembered this scene quite a few times during recovery."
> This is just funny my guy
it’s just another racist ruin
In all honesty some people are that lucky... My brother got stabbed 8 times by some thugs initiating into a gang. Didn't hit a single artery or organ.
"I really loved GOT in the first seasons for this lack of usual ""plot armor"" that many main characters have in the majority of the shows

I mean hell people got fucking rekt as fuck there in the show, Main characters even, even when you may think and start to realize some of them are untouchable in that moment..and **boom** there goes off their hand!! that shit was lit as fuck, not like rest of predictable shows.

Its clear in every other show/movie/story etc that the Main character wont die there, or there or there and again there..because its the FUCKING MAIN CHARACTER and the story is not near the end where we may get that 5% of chance were a MC may dies considering in how many other stories they survive in today's fictional  media

**Because to truly enjoy a show nowadays you need to do selective self lobotomy to ignore the fact that the main character cant die** in any of those fake ""suspenseful moments""

PS: at 10 years i realized i could predict most of bomb exploding in the usual action movies, for how the camera focuses on certain scenes, and sadly only a few years later i realized same for the main characters plot armor..and let me tell you that shit transforms in boring more then 90% of the good good stuff(and not just 90% of all the stuff that are created)

I even predicted how the Night king will die in comment in this sub or GOT to the letter before it happened  for how mainstream the show got in last seasons..."
Tyrion: Slashed once in the face and ended up barely conscious for weeks
">Arya: Stabbed repeatedly in the stomach then swims in dirty canal, fine by the end of the episode. 

You forgot to mention that not long after receiving the wound (how long can it take a master assassin like faceless man to track down a bleeding target) she does a full chase scene complete with multiple jumps that should tear open her freshly treated wound, but at the end she fights waif and wins..."
The Drogo example is exceptionally accurate
"Or ""jumped the Stark"".



Eyyy!"
"Yeah, I remember seeing the Arya stabbing and her miracle healing and for the first time the show really made me go ""WTF"", that was like a watershed moment."
member the [stable boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvKJeaxRONk)?
"I would say they jumped the shark end of season 4/beginning of season 5. Leaving out the Tysha reveal not only crippled Tyrion's character development, but also showed how poorly the writers understood ASOIAF. But since it was a pretty good season, I can push it back to Dorne."
"Petition to change ""jumped the shark"" to ""jumped into the canal"""
Idk I have a stomach ache.
"I kept expecting them to confirm that the Many-Faced God had denied them her the gift of death to fulfill a greater purpose.

But then it turned out to just be plot armor and Many-Faced God never got mentioned again."
A common misconception. Vigorous parkour is actually a rapid healer. The poppy and sleep was just to recover from all that running and jumping.
"I don't remember much about the show (my brain is automatically deleting stuff over being irrelevant) but Milk of the Poppy was a poison right? You drink it to have a less painful dead.

Edit: thank you for the clarification"
"Remember, she knows a killer when she sees one..."
I had forgotten of that wish for years. Gods we had hope back then...
#W E D O  N O T  S E W
At the very least she could have lasting physical effects. Show her in pain long after it heals. Ned had a cane from a leg wound nearly 20 years old
They shot every episode for first time viewers
Yea what a shitshow
"Good question Arya, why dont I warg into a flock of fucking birds and determine the answer 8000x faster"
I’m going to go now
I feel physical pain
"As someone who watch up through season six and heard all the grumbling, decided to call it quits there... it does bother me I’ll never have a good resolution to the story. Ah well life goes on I guess"
"I am a fan of The Last Kingdom and enjoy it more since it drops the fantasy part. Game of Thrones near the end was all dragons and regenerating armies. Earlier on it was lots politics and deceit which TLK relies on more. My only issue with The Last Kingdom is then repetitiveness. No one makes any progress. Someone new shows up and they go back to the grand battle, everyone back to square one. That said, I’m waiting on the next season."
"Better than seasons 1-3 of Vikings? The early seasons of Vikings were some of my favourite episodes of TV ever, but as the show went on it just got worse and worse. >!Ragnar dying was the real death of the show, but it had been going downhill before that anyway, not to mention the massive time jump!<"
The Hound is dead but Sandor Clegane is around digging holes.
"OUT! OUT, DAMN YOU! I'M DONE WITH YOU! GO, RUN BACK TO WINTERFELL! I'LL HAVE YOUR HEAD ON A SPIKE!"
"WEAR IT IN SILENCE, OR I'LL HONOR YOU AGAIN!"
Groundhog day sort of fits.
"Years ago there was a page-a -month serial in Heavy Metal that had something like this concept. The rookie bad guy on his first day has an awesome shot at the hero, but the leader pushes his crossbow away and admonishes that you NEVER kill the hero.


It was amusing the first time, but after a few issues the one-note joke got old very quickly."
WINE! WINE! MOOOOOOOOAR WINE!
"your brother has surely benefited from modern medical care, a lot of rest, and antibiotics, which is absolutely not the case with arya.

even if she managed to find someone very experienced in sewing it up and these wounds are relatively superficial, she could not have escaped an infection. And even less able to do parkour 6 hours later despite these 29 staples"
"knowing that main character wont die isnt always a bad thing. If you rewatch movies or reread stories, you know who's gonna live and who's not. But if the story is fine, it doesnt really matter that much. 

but it depends from story to story"

I was the same way with the UK's Masterchef. You could predict the competition winner weeks before the final  based on the music played when they did their introduction.
"To be fair, it was heavily implied the witch was making everything worse. He still got the infection and maybe would have died? But he for sure does cause of her."
"Not really, he has been poisoned by the maeagi woman"
Get out and take your upvote with you
What about the sewer bath? Was it to clean the wounds?
"Not exclusively, it can be used for that but it is basically a pain killer for them like morphine/fentanyl/oxys are for us. I mean all of the ones i just mentioned comes from the poppy plant as well. A little can relieve pain and a lot could kill you."
"It was like valeriana; but a little stronger, a few drops can help you to sleep/ease pain. A full cup will kill you."
Nah. It could be a poison if OD'ed on. I think it was nightshade.
"The acute awareness it takes to know someone is a killer after watching them slaughter tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children. Impeccable sixth sense."
URGGHHHHHH
Remember being hopeful we'd see Lady Stoneheart from season 3 until like fucking season 6? They could have even had her in season 7 and drawn the plot out by making her take down House Frey. Nymerias pack of wolves anyone? We could have had motherfucking Lady Stoneheart killing Walder Frey with a colossal fuck off wolf pack.
"Or you know, since i can see everything thats happened or is happening, gimme like 5 seconds you adventurous cunt"
Yeah. I thought that's a clever way to bring him back to westeros without breaking his oath as a nightwatch
"Because it felt like the late middle/start of D&D phoning in the writing. I forget the exact details from the books right now but he was getting way more involved in the politics and starting to use the nights watch to ally with Stannis and all that and it acruallly made sense for them to feel like he was putting their operation in danger unnecessarily to play politics and “for the watch” really meant something. In the show it was as simple as convincing everyone they had to fight the white walkers, everyone obviously agreeing, and then randomly turning on him because they needed it for the cliffhanger but abandoned enough of the story for it to just be a random example of “omg ppl die on this show”.  And then the D’s gave an Interview and said that Kit Harrington the actor wasn’t coming back to the show as some form of misdirection because the whole thing was just so....nothing. George’s version was great, like everything he does, but it was where these douches just phoned it in and couldn’t be bothered to find any inspiration."
"to be fhones, i still havent fully watched vikings, ill have to give it another shot to judge it fairly...  I just havent gotten into Vikings yet, I am sure I will though .

&#x200B;

But this awareness in  stories that the MC clearly will  **never die there** never leaves me, and is specially painful to get through those passages when the author/creator milks them for too long of an time/arc with only that objective to put the spectator on suspense worrying for MC survival.

Its a different thing when the author is smart and the story/scene is about the MC risking losing something that, being  a friend/enemy or object or power source that would completely  change the whole story for how it was until then"
Yeah but still it shows that even small injuries can be fatal and infections exist
"Not really, I don't think. What I got from it is that there are too pretty valid interpretations to drogo's death,: one's the one you just mentioned, where the witch from the beginning planned getting revenge by poisoning him, the other would be that she actually did try to dress the wound and treat it, but drogon did not comply so it became infected. If I recall correctly, this is even more divided in the books, where drogo at some point removes the dressings because they itch.

Dude Stoneheart appears in like a few chapters in the last book and you'll never hear about her again at this rate. Her character is nothing.
"Plus, like... it happened in the books."
"I have t read the books. But I can say I definitely don’t remember the show like that. I remember it was all sorts of controversial stuff he was doing. Yes, all for the white walkers but he did a lot of stuff that would piss off the night’s watch faithful. Idk, I’m just saying I def don’t think it had jumped ship completely up to that point. And of course they’d give interviews saying he wasn’t coming back. No one in the world was sure for once."
"Vikings isn't as good as the early seasons of GOT, but Travis Fimmel as Ragnar is one of my favourite acting performances of all time"
"tbh, Bran maybe has the best story, but we weren't shown it, we just got cut through that night. Maybe he was talking about the whole history of the world and how he is a manipulative deity and taking its course..

but maybe not.. but, expect tht in a book version, it would make more sense."
stop typing you are only making yourself look like an even bigger idiot
Think he's using it right
or just the plot finished with that dude's story and even telegraphed it way ahead of time for those that follow the story.
"If nothing else, the fact that they made such a big deal about his wound indicates that they sure THOUGHT it was a very serious thing."
"From what I remember (which may be wrong - haven't watched S1 for a few years and read GoT like 10 years ago), the answer is yes and no. She technically saved his life but he became a shell of a man. Really, he had no life at all since he was couldn't....do anything. And in doing that, she also took their child. IIRC, it was all done as punishment for what the dothraki did to her (or her people?) and to prevent the stallion who mounts the world, which is what their son was supposed to be. 

So yes, she saved his life but only in a very technical sense."
drogo's mommy took him to the loony bin and they gave him a certificate PROVING that he does not have horsey brains
"Dude she's hanged like a half dozen Greys already, including the heir I think, or at least his heirs heir. Her and by extension the Brotherhood without Banners will have a big impact in the fall of House Frey in the books. Change my mind."
"Is Dude Stoneheart another one they didn't include in the TV show? Man, I really should read the books."
The book version? Haha haha hahaha that’s never going to be written. He’s going to die and there’s going to be 700 pages describing various banquets without him figuring out how to connect them released as his unfinished work

The long game
"When I was registering for reddit, I tried to use my regular username “Sour pie”. But reddit doesnt allow spaces so I tried the obvious thing and replaced it with underscore. I was fucking mad when it said that it was taken, I rarely get this name taken from me. So I just added a second underscore. A couple of month later I noticed that I could click my username and join as a second account. That account was the original Sour_pie. Apparently my dumbass didn’t remember joining Reddit a couple years prior, and I stole my own username. But I was too lazy to start using that account beachside I already had some stuff on this one."
The 123 at the end of my username is because I actually took my own username. The original account kept giving me emails I didn't want and even if I blocked Reddit it kept sending me them so I created this one instead.
Nahhhh no one wanted this name lol
I'm certain Peter Dinklage's dad is pissed at me.
"everybody here with normal usernames while mine is some shitty word that I imagined when I was 12... like what the fuck ""umotex"" is"
I fought with people over this user name alot especially in videogames. Guess non of them uses reddit though

That’s how I came up with my username

He's tried to get some password change on my email, but it didn't work. I've lost the battle on a few platforms but not a lot."

I have a friend who needed to alter his Username on Twitch and when the one that he actually wanted got free he didn't want to change his current one right away so he took the name he originally wanted for his second account to hold it until he renames his main account. Little did he now that it takes Twitch years to release Usernames after a account by that name got changed so he changed the username of his second account and realized that he couldn't give his main account that name since someone(his second account) had it just recently.

I end up swiping left on almost everyone, because I don't swipe right if they don't have a bio. (unless they have funny pictures, funny pictures+empty bio= right swipe).

Anyway, I would swipe right on this person."

Comment
"I'd take this advise, but I found it on Reddit."
But make sure all your information just confirms what you already believe so you can feel like you’re thinking for yourself when really you’re just succumbing to confirmation bias for the 100th time this month.
"So also check Facebook, Twitter, and my neighbor.  Got it."
Source: Reddit
"Social media is a cesspool of propaganda designed to divide/destroy America.

It has been more effective than imaginable. Free thinking does not exist for the masses."
Umm... Reddit is a decent place to start as long as you follow through with fact checking and READING THE FUCKING ARTICLE!
Don't get your ~~political~~ information off reddit......
"Fortunately, multiple sources are available on Reddit itself."
"Every website is typically its own echo chamber.

Read it all.  Mother Jones, Breitbart, CNN, OANN, Fox News, NBC, Politico, Daily Wire, etc.  It's all designed to convince you, not to inform you."
The main political subs are so left it’s insane. Say something that doesn’t fit they’re way of thinking and you’ll get downvoted and called a racist or nazi.
Then we probably shouldn't be listening to this meme.
"It’s gotta he said, some reddit comments make me think about different angles to things  I wouldn’t have otherwise thought about. Reddit can be good, but it’s always good to fact check and cross examine."
"Reddit is awesome for news and keeping up on current events, if you know how to interpret all of the information available and sort through the bullshit to find the facts"
What are some good sources?
Dont show this to /r/politics
It’s just become a media machine anyway. My home feed disappeared under political news and media barrage these days. This was once a good spot for people to talk. Now it’s just agenda agenda agenda.
"You mean the multiple sources that are often posted on reddit?

I agree with the second part completely, but I have to point out that it's possible to do so here."
"Whenever I tell my mom or dad to stop watching only Fox News they always answer back, “Stop watching CNN.” Just because you get your news from one source, doesn’t mean I do..."
I'll think about it.
"Oh, man.  The hell with that duck -- he's an asshole."
"I can't trust the media to give me information, 
so I have to look everything up, put it in context, see what other people think, and form my own opinions."
"Reddit and social media (not Facebook)can be a great place to find out what’s really happening though. I’ve used Reddit and Twitter to see what’s happening with the protests and the riots. I know what’s happening days before most people and I get to the entire clip and not the edit one they show on tv. 

I also think the comment section can be great source for additional information, especially if their is a pay wall. Don’t get me wrong 90% of the time the comments are jokes but often times I find my information and links to further information. You never see stuff like that on other sites.  You just have to be careful because no matter what your political view is you’ll end up in an echo chamber."
"""think for yourself"" u got any more of these ridiculous advices?"
"Coolio, thanks"
“Only if those sources are reddit approved progressive sources!”
I dunno. If you see /u/PoppinKream post something it had been researched for Reddit.
I did this in 2016. I was SURE Bernie would win. Then I was SURE Hilary would win. Now I don’t know what to think about anything.
PBS news is great unbiased source of news. It's boring as hell like the news should be.
"Reddit gives you multiple sources to look at. How about, don't just read the title of a reddit post to form or reinforce your opinion."
Or your economic information
"Absolutely. I thought in 2016 Sanders was a shoo-in for the nomination, but as it turned out, it was simply me spending too much time in an echo chamber. 

""Don't surround yourself with yourself"""
Yes
The nice thing about reddit is that it’s a hub where multiple sources can be researched
"Ehhhh

The important thing is being able to determine what is and isn't a valid source

To practice skepticism and open-mindedness of things, not to just be unbelieving - but also be open to the fact that something you believe is wrong is right and vice versa

And hell, even after that, be open that you didn't get the full picture then - because there's always something we're gonna miss

For that end, a lot of the political subreddits are pretty poor - they do tend to push a single narrative

But don't treat that as a reason to ""go to the other side and listen to them,"" cause the other side might be, well, Neo-Nazis or something and you really don't need them any more than you need another hole in your head.

Honestly, the biggest thing that helped inform me was research and education - I don't know how valuable ""thinking for myself"" is on subjects I know little about. I defer for the most part and just work off what's important to me on principle.

Sorry. I'm rambling. I think my point is that this is kind of not helpful as a message, and other sources aren't gonna fix the problem of misinformation without being able to determine what is valid in the first place. And that's a lot trickier to explain than what'll fit in a meme."
Please go directly for Wikipedia for all information...
"But.. reddit = good, fb/ig = bad!"
"I get almost all of my news from social media, but only because most of the people I follow are reporters and news media companies.

Things I look for when validating if a news story is true:

1. Are multiple news media outlets reporting it, based on their own reporting? If yes, then done.
2. If there's only one source of the story, is it at least a reputable news media outlet? Too many single-source stories are from opinion websites, or blog sites that are trying to fool people into thinking they are a serious news organization.
3. If the source seems sketchy, are any reputable reporters or news outlets throwing their weight behind the story?
4. Also important to understand, among the various news outlets I follow, which ones are serious journalists and which ones like to sensationalize stories. I do follow some news outlets that love the clickbait headlines, and it's important to understand which ones those are."
Easier said than done.
"More than just politics too.  I get house cleaning tips from two podcasts, the “Mixing Bleach and Ammonia is Toxic” podcast and the “Mixing Bleach and Ammonia is a Highly Efficient Cleaning Solution” podcast.  The latter stopped updating though and I don’t want to go by just the first one without hearing the other side."
"The problem with this advice is that ALL news media is reporting the same shit with the same spin. There's no real journalism anymore, it's all opinion shows, and they all have the exact same opinion. It's hard for a lot of people to go past that to find reliable sources, and it's even harder to weed out the bullshit."
Better Reddit than Facebook!
I like to use reddit because I typically believe the opposite of what 95% of the news is trying to push that I see on here. One of those things where reading something you disagree with makes you look into it deeper and either strengthen or change your opinion based off of your research
But reddit tells me hows to think! Thinking for myself it's hard.
This needs to be pinned to the top of reddit all the time
"Guys, do check out r/AskEconomics. It's truly invaluable source of information's but you must browse by TOP posts. Ever since 2018 most post have been screen for ""regressive"" conservative opinions."
"I agree. And disagree.. reddit is a collage of different news sources. Anyone can post any article from any souce. Many times, the same information is posted from mult sources. While this makes more credible, there is a large percentage of younger, left leaning individuals that use Reddit. Therefore, lots of left leaning articles get voted to the top. (If you want the boomers copy/paste from Fox and Friends, please see fb)."
A lot of important stuff never makes it to the front page because it doesn't look good for liberals. I'm a liberal myself and made the mistake of assuming everything that's important will make its way to the front page. I've been embarrassed on multiple occasions for being oblivious to certain news stories that conservatives were drooling over.
Reddit makes you think everyone is a socialist loving Bernie bro and that anyone who disagrees is a Nazi.
"Check multiple sources..... but only when the people are all exactly like you. Liberals only check liberal sources, conservatives only check conservative sources. Don't let anyone question your perfect understanding of the world."
"People tend to only search for political content that supports their own views anyway, resulting in stronger biases and a tendency to dismiss others' opinions. So this whole political enlightenment thing, it's all kind of generally useless (and divisive). Political discussion and research only ever has  power or effect when it's boosted by lots of money. So spare yourself the effort and do something more rewarding for society."
Amen
Or at least read the article. Not just the headline and comments
"Also, check your sources. This meme, for example, was posted by a frequent commenter in r/Conservative and r/guns (not to mention a simp in porn subreddits, but that's beside the point).  

Of course they would advise you to get your political information elsewhere."
"Word. Especially subreddits like r/outoftheloop . Answers there provide background on OPs question then present opinion masquerading as facts.

Always ask for sources and then _read_ those sources"
This should really be the Scroll of Truth meme instead of Actual Advice Mallard.
The reddit paradox
Don't do it! Fact checking is hard and takes too much time! Screaming at headlines is way more productive!
https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/023/397/C-658VsXoAo3ovC.jpg
Redditers tend to actually read the articles.
"This is something I'm struggling with a lot lately. I am pretty far left-leaning, so obviously most of Reddit gives me that lovely echo chamber, confirmation-of-my-own-beliefs feeling. I started seeing my hypocrisy, since I judge people on the ""other side"" with so much disdain if all they watch is Fox News. I started wondering how I was any better. 

I had to block out lots of the news/politics subreddits just to limit my exposure to the echo chamber, but now I'm unsure where I should get updates on current events and whatnot. Really sucks that there are no unbiased sources anymore."
Underrated comment here 10/10
"Also that conspiracy video on Youtube.  *""They""* don't want to you to see it!!!"
If you don't form your opinions based off Nextdoor are you even intelligent?
Don't forget TikThot
You forgot the barber shop.
i agree and usually in the comments the article is thoroughly vetted    not always.    but i’ve gotten a lot of great insights politically and on world events from reddit links to news sources.   most of which without political lean.   another great point is that reddit provides an international component/world view via the comment section that is invaluable to me as an american for obvious reasons.
Or just use primary sources and form your own opinion. I don't need a journalist to tell me something Trump tweeted was asinine; I can go straight to the horses mouth and see that for myself.
"Read the articles (Multiple subs), fact check everything, IGNORE THE COMMENTARY!"
"I think you are giving 2020 reddit to much credit.

reddit is much further politically left than it used to be (remember Ron Paul?).  Used to be a bunch of libertarian type programmers that trolled people for having irrational belief systems and so it was very progressive but at the core was center left at the most.  Now Reddit is over represented by self loathing white cancel culture virtual signalers that not only cant hold a rational conversation they flat out refuse to even try."
">Umm...

Tl;dr"
"From a diverse selection such as CommonDreams.org, TruthDig, and The Intercept"
Yeah this. Multiple articles when something big hits and when it's major we get a megathread with pages of articles
Or you go to right leaning subs and get immediately banned for asking a question.
"NPR, BBC, Reuters"
Straight out yo ass.
I personally like the economist. In my experience it contains the least amount of bias.
"They don’t exist anymore sorry, have to install the “political bias” filter in your brain and even then half the shit is made up."
Anything that provides an independently verifiable primary source.
"r/politics :  all submissions must be word-for-word copies of headlines from a wide variety of whitelist-allowed sources across the political spectrum.

Conservatives:  why is r/politics so liberal?!?!?!.!"
"Yeah, and the mods are getting really histrionic. It's hard to have a normal conversation anymore without somebody getting insulted and trying to get you banned"
"‘News’ these days is kinda weird. opinion politics and people twisting a situation still counts as news depending on who its coming from. There are events that happen in the world that has been reported, and then people who report on a confirmed thing further, so its atleast sourced, and then can make speculation or claims from that (based on their politics) and that can be news too?"
"When some subs consider the root, salon, commondreams and Washington Post or be a well rounded group of sources, it kinda proves it's point"
"Which ""this"" did you do?  Get your political information from reddit, or search multiple sources?

Either way, I think you'd have probably wound up thinking Hillary would win in 2016.  Even Fox News was predicting (not rooting for, but predicting victory for) Hillary."
r/enlightenedcentrism
"Idk how accurate it is these days, and idk if i could find it again, but I saw something a while back that shows what you said is half true. Conservatives tended to get about 70-80% of their news from conservative sources and the rest from liberal, centrists/moderates would get theirs in about a 60-70% liberal 30-40% conservative split, and liberals would get about 95% of their news from liberal sources."
"""The news doesn't always tell you what to think, but it always tells you what to think about.""

I forget the source of that quote, but I think that's a lot of what we're missing when we talk about the media. The news dictates the conversations of the day, and we have our choice of responses about that conversation, but our responses aren't really informed by the news of the day, or they shouldn't be, but by our life experience and body of understanding. So following which conversation the news has decided is important, really isn't that important. It's more important to build experience and understanding in general, so our responses to the news of the day will be more informed in general.

>So spare yourself the effort and do something more rewarding for society.

That is the ultimate solution, just keep learning all the time, do what needs to be done, and don't let the news decide what conversations you think are most important."
"Just because someone disagrees with you politically doesn't necessarily mean that their advice is always bad.

The advice given in this particular OP is good regardless of your politics."
"It's weird.  For all the talk of Reddit being a biased place to get news, I get most of my news from Reddit and tend to have more general awareness of world events than my friends and colleagues.  Of course, I subscribe to about 10 different news subs, including left and right wing news/politics subs and science and tech subs. 

It really isn't about where you access/aggregate the information as much as it is exposing yourself to as many views as possible."
Guess my mind is running n the endless loop today.
Liberal paradox
"I kinda figure if you read one article from one source and another article from another source, the overlapping parts are what’s real and the rest is either an opinion or there for clicks. Base your opinion on the overlapping parts and do more research if you find the subject matter interesting."
There never were unbiased sources.
By left leaning you mean American far left? So center right in comparison of the rest of the world?
If they don't want me to see it I have to see it now where is it? where is it?!?!?!?
Tweets are not news.
"Often times you can find more complete info or additional info and sources in the comments.  It depends on the sub and the thread.  Of course, most of the comments are just poor attempts at humor, but there is a lot of good perspective that can be gained from the comments."
"Ok. r/all is slightly left leaning... It's not as if all the other relevant articles are gone. It's real easy to be lazy and not challenge your perception.

It takes effort to stay informed."
"I'm not arguing with you, but I've personally never seen those sites. The ones I always see are the guardian, the hill, and the Washington Post.

 Are those sites skewed conservative or liberal?"
"don’t forget Reuters, The Guardian, BBC, New York Times"
The thing is the subs that are supposed to neutral. Just how I would like my news unbiased.
AP?
"National propaganda radio

Big black cock

 Reuters Breaking news editor Rob Cox tweeted “This is what happens when u/realDonaldTrump calls journalists the enemy of the people. Blood is on your hands, Mr. President. Save your thoughts and prayers for your empty soul. """
Sad but super true. I watch Tim Pool from time to time because he’s moderate left leaning but I try to find the most moderate opinion for news topics.
"The main problem with /r/politics is that they allow too much fluff. There's way too many articles about what someone famous said about an issue/Trump, or so-and-so ""blasting"" someone else. Also some of their whitelisted sources probably shouldn't be (I'm looking at you, The Independent). On their front page right now: football player makes comment about kneeling during anthem; Taylor Swift says Confederate statues made her sick; Judd Appatow says Trump is not intellectually capable to run the country. Now, none of those things are false, but they also aren't that newsworthy.

There's also the selection bias, where certain news gets less coverage because the subreddit doesn't like it. After Bernie lost big in that one night of primaries, there was shockingly little about the huge loss for his campaign. And you don't see too many conservative think pieces either.

That being said, it's still probably one of the better political subreddits, but that's a really low bar."
"It's not the rules of r/politics that create the liberal bias, it's the people on the sub. The types of articles that are upvoted are generally very gracious to liberal politicians and philosophies, and anything that casts Republicans or right leaning ideology in a positive light doesn't seem to ever gain traction. Additionally, all the top comments in the subreddit are bashing conservatives, talking about how Republican voters are all ignorant and racist, jokes about Trump, digs on McConnell, and general hatred towards anything that could be seen as Right leaning. 

Because of the tilt in r/Politics, many centrists and conservatives tend to avoid it all together, and the bias gets worse. If you want to say that Reddit leans left, and the bias is inevitable, then that's fine. But to deny that it exists isn't intellectually honest."
"Lmfao...okay

By the 9 look at your post history...no bias here, folks"
"Answer: because the sources are liberal. Here's a scientific study that proves it.

I wanted to learn the landscape and navigation so I could really participate. I watched it get sold the first time and then sold again. I watched btc steadily climb, saw Tesla rise and went to the schwarzenegger ama’s read posts from Wil Wheaton. But now it’s just all banning and politics. I’ve thought about quitting more then once and now I find myself censoring my own comments."
"Yeah, fuck centrism, you need more tribalism in your politics."
"Yes!  This!   
Isn’t the point of reddit to aggregate the information?  It’s like the sections of a newspaper, except for the world and a ton more sections.  Do people think there are actual content creators at Reddit that are writing articles?  Maybe they should read more on Reddit."
"Yeah but aside from specific subs, the bigger, general subject subreddits have their leanings and god forbid you comment the wrong opinion"
"Exactly!! I tend to see things on reddit and then start searching for more info. Is this in the world news, can I find multiple viewpoints on it, etc..."
You think you do because mass media backs it up.  There are many stories or angles on a story that you only see if you look at right wing or alternate web sites.
Reality has a liberal bias.
Lmao there's always this guy
But equally as often you can find tons of misleading info in the comments or good analysis can be buried under popular comments.
The Hill is center. The Guardian and Washington Post lean left.
Anything neutral is deemed leftist to conservatives.
"Al Jazeera is a good one, although has some shading financial times for middle eastern politics. 

I’ve found; however, they do a really good job at covering the USA, and Europe from a very non-partisan position. Although this was a few years ago, I don’t know about now."
Not to mention if you say something that isn't accepted you get a put in longer and longer timeouts to prevent you from posting.
Yep

That's exactly what I'm thinking. Then again it was 8 degrees the other day and everyone I know thought it was freezing so people in other countries might make fun of us for that.
As any brit would agree. Its a different heat abroad
Most people are not used to those temperatures and rarely have them so they also don't have AC. You have an average temperature of 21° while we here in Germany are at 8.5°

Yes 28 is hot when the average outside temp is around 23

Even indoors it isn't too bad. Surely you wouldn't want to open the window anyway if its hot out. It'd just let all the bugs in.
That makes sense. It tends to be hotter on the mainland than Tassie so you'd have different preferences down there.
"I fear for July and August. Yesterday it was 29°C here with 76%. It won't get better in the following months (well, except of course 2020 does what it does best and we finally get some nice nuclear winter)."

I was in Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, and Denmarl during the European winter of 2019, and not a single day was had double digit temperatures. It's very rare in Tasmania for a day not to have a double digit max. It's winter here now, and the lowest max this werk is 12, with the highest being 16."

"BUT imperial is the freeist, we are so good at being free that we kicked our own non-free ass. I can go all the way down to 1/128, never had to use it though."
I guess they do exist but I don't know anyone who owns one. We just tend to ignore it until it gets real hot and then crank up the aircon. Many people do have screen doors which fulfill the same function as a window screen I guess though.
"Yeah, up here in SA it stays a lot warmer than Tasmania for most of the year. Looks like the max for this week is 19 degrees."
Why not rig something up? You're crafty. And you can get screen really cheap online!
"I might do sometime. I have an AC in my bedroom window anyway so it couldn't hurt to use the gap next to it for something. Unfortunately the loungeroom window doesn't open so I can't do anything there.

In a lot of other languages the V makes a hard F sound and sounds kind of like a W

"Oh. I’m from an anarcho-syndicalist commune. We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week. But all the decisions of that officer have to be ratified at a special biweekly meeting. By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs— wait... I didn’t vote for Putin? Strange men being paid to distribute votes is no basis for a system of government! Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some unfair unnecessary voting ceremony!"

They are? Where do English speakers pronounce /b/ as a bilabial fricative?

Comment
Nice find. Hope that will fixed soon. Gj
No wonder I was getting killed all those times :3
There’s a spot like this in ascent too
People stating this is not game breaking lmao what are you guys drinking ? This needs to be fixed ASAP
Nice find! Hope riot see this.
"It is such a weird bug, I wonder what could cause this issue...."
Gotta fix this
I love it but why the length of the video with no interaction lol
Worse than valve. Going back to cs.
People play viper?
skybox for players is different so no you cant
"yo that's broke, how precise is this?"
I literally died cuz of that today
That explains why they one shot me through my ult.
There's not even going to come back OTM.
Security through obscurity is not a thing.
Theres another spot that's smaller on A bind near shower
"I can't upload a video since friday and it's saying ""something went wrong plz try again later"" .. can someone help me with this thank you"
Michael’s in the mall outside of Birmingham.
There's also a lot of flavour
He would flash+Ult into the enemy team.
Wow thats how i died ok.
Split? What is that? Never seen this map
I’ve made a post about how you can do this anywhere
Thats what keeps killing me! Pls fix so I can get frags
"Wow, I actually died to this like 5 games ago and was thinking that this guy was either wallhacking or having the luck of his life."
"Yeah, can anyone explain to me why?"
"SHE NEEDS HALP, RIOT PLEASE"
"Its not a bug, it's feature"
Why post it on reddit and not support forums?
"There is a spot in B side on blind , i saw it in the beta but i don’t know if it was fixed."
"Wow, this is a lot more like overwatch than csgo.

No idea how anyone would think this is a csgo killer.  It's an overwatch killer, maybe.

Although Counterstrike: Weeb is what this game should be called moving forward."
Ready to launch
This is rough!  Thanks for sharing.
"I'm a viper main and I gotta say, it hurts watching people disrespect her abilities. They just run right through them. 

It's completely warranted too. She is so underpowered. Then there's characters who can shoot flashes that are practically impossible to avoid. 

Why is it that some characters get abilities that are just geared towards giving you free kills? It's brainless."
"This happened while I was playing her recently. I got confused as to whether or not I was actually in the ult but I got shot immediately so I guess I wasn't. I can't remember if it was on Split as well but if it was, I doubt it was in that spot too. This bug probably happens in other places."
"Holy shit so this is how I get shot through my ult sometimes. This is super helpful, nice work"
"Since I've read that it also happens to other maps I tried it out for myself. I found that it also happens in Ascent A Site and Haven B Site too. It's easy to reproduce and it's very abusable in post plant situation.

"Lol one specific spot spot has a glitch for a specific power for a specific character. 

GAMEBREAKING"
"This isn't game breaking. 

This only happens in a very specific scenario on a very specific character. This bug doesn't prevent her or others from playing the game nor does it give an enormous advantage to anyone.  

A game breaking bug is a bug that quite breaks the game. 

One example of a game breaking bug is the bug in league of legends where where xerath could stand in base and kill everything on the map all at once. 

It could be replicated and abused in every match that had a xerath and there was no counterplay involved. 

This is just a slight annoyance. A regular run of the mill bug."
"Gamebreaking: something that literally makes the game unplaybable

 Not gamebreaking: a bug that happens in very niche situations (like picking Viper, playing on Split and doing ulti in a specific spot)"

*Cries in 5 games of split in a row*
good thing vipers never ult
Good thing Morty doesn’t he
"No no, that was just... regular kills, my dude"
*Soja player* Yeah me too!
...where?
"Nobody is denying that, nodody is denying it is a huge bug that seriously affects her ability to be useful. But the game runs just fine, everyone can play, it's game changing but by definition it's not gamebreaking. A gamebreaking bug is the one that makes your PC freeze midgame"
"Major bug, but not game breaking"
"You don't understand what game breaking literally means.

GAME-BREAKING.

You got a little scuff on your bike, which is totally fixable but you go yelling to mommy ""IT'S BROKEN, WE NEED TO FIX THIS ASAP.""

It's like you never really learned the morale of the boy who cried wolf."
Viper plays without ultimate anyway. Th biggest strength so far is the possibility to enter a side when using her ultimate as a smoke.
Add another noodle to the pile!
Spaghetti code.
Actually just broken
[GAMEBREAKING]
Bugs can inherently be gamebreaking
30 second rule
"It's very precise especially on some maps.  


Edit: Yes, I just found out that it happens on other maps too."
"No, this isn't a 1 map 1 spot specific. It happens to other maps too."
The place that you would put the ult to replicate this is a common spot for her ult and wide enough to be replicated easily. This would definitely cost the round specially to unaware players and the only counterplay is not to use the ult.
Hilarious and strange that you're being downvoted. Guess people are just really used to hyperbole and/or don't know what 'game Breaking' actually means. It's certainly a big bug. But it is _very_ far from being 'game breaking'
"no it couldn't, to even get to that spot you needed a script because it had to be pixel perfect, people who abused it were cheating."
Any viper on split would likely ult here once a game. Not sure how this is niche.
Comprehension: the action or capability of understanding something provided the context.
game breaking: making a character in the game useless sometimes. this pretty much is it.
"By definition: Gamebreaking, in the name itself, means it’s something that breaks the logic or otherwise rules of the game, for example, being able to see through a fucking viper ultimate..."
I mean this pretty much invalidates her ult...
"Why u assuming this lol, it sounds pretty obvious"
need a haircut greaser
"Ah, shit it was only a flat payment.

How many words does it take to have proper online, proper 360 camera outside, mini-games and more villagers depth (repeating the same sentence. Makes more sense since he probably doesn’t understand this. I was never a scoring threat, which wouldn’t need to, the man was chasing people around with a sword. He wasn't just a science fiction writer. He was like ""you shot 5500 rounds in a weekend?""."
"At least it's not 5 games of ascent in a row...

I thought they reduced the pickrate for that map but I still almost exclusively get ascend"
Yes I agree. Lucky to have that opportunity.
Let him have hope.
Thanks :(
In ascent
"Or the one that disconnects you, doesn't tell you, leaves you in-game and magically reconnects you 3 rounds in and then you're given a time penalty. Yay. Just had it happen to me."
Ayy another guy giving English lessons that can't pick up on hyperbole lol
"Gamebreaking could simply mean during the *match* a bug directly changes the outcome of a situation.

What would you call a bug that changes the outcome of lets say, a competitive game. A grenade doesn't do damage or the smoke doesn't go off correctly. I'd say those are pretty game breaking, because the fundamental game isn't working as intended, and the match would certainly be redone."
"You're technically correct, but gamebreaking is generally the term used in these cases. More accurate would be it's breaking the competitive nature of the game and thus the game itself, by ways of an ability not working as expected with huge consequences."
Exactly.  One power of one character affected in one spot is \*not\* gamebreaking.
This is true i thought game breaking is a bug that makes game crash or freeze?
Why are you booing him? He's right
"No idea why you’re getting downvoted, people just love using buzzwords. It happens all the time in the League subreddit too. For example, in League of Legends, a game breaking bug occurred when two champions (think of them like Agents in Valorant) called Taliyah and Karthus had an interaction with a spell called Smite that disconnected EVERYONE from the game. The equivalent would be like if Reyna Ultimate disconnected everyone from the game. A game breaking bug literally BREAKS the game. This Viper bug does not break the game, although it has massive gameplay implications. So it is game CHANGING."
"Wait... what? I know her ability is quite easily countered especially by sova or raze, but it's still a great ult to protect the spike that's planted or dropped by the enemy team. A good viper shouldn't really lose much in her ult unless she gets rushed by at least like 3 enemies and even then should kill at least one or 2 before going. Idk what you're on about my man. 

Playing Viper I don't think I lost more than 30% plants I used my ult on and we were usually at a disadvantage if I did that. 70 to 30 are very good odds for me. And protecting enemy spike I think I failed even less because people aren't prepared for countering this ult except for in sites."
Literally the dumbest rule ever lmao
WELL THE OP WASNT SPECIFIC ABOUT THAT AND NOW I FEEL LIKE BIG DUM DUM
You’re arguing about the ergonomics of a term. It’s a bug that can make the difference in games. Therefore I would definitely consider it game breaking
"As a viper main, I couldn’t tell you how many times I place my ultimate there, and also, I came to this subreddit about to post this bug because it happened in a match (clearly I wasn’t gonna be the first one so I figured I wouldn’t bother). I thought the other player was cheating but someone on their team said he could see right through, I called bullshit but nevertheless tested it out. Sure enough, yes this bug is easily reproducible and yes, this can happen within reason in a match. So none of this “minor inconvenience” bullshit, it’s a real game breaking bug, and needs to get fixed, period."
i don't think the people who downvoted you understood what you were saying
Frankly she was a very exciting pixel
This isn't a context issue though. It's just a mis-use if the word 'gamebreaking' which specifically refers to issues that makes the entire game unplayable in some form.
nope it pretty buffs the ult as def :-D sage wall to the left and aim for the bots run in xD
"I don't think something is game breaking if it can only happen under very specific circumstances. i.e. only for an ult in a single location giving a small window of view. Something game breaking is cipher's camera being put under the map, giving the location of every enemy, as on that teleporter map that I only call ""teleporters"" because I don't know what any of the maps are actually named. 

This would maybe get you one extra kill over the span of an entire game. if this can be replicated easily around and corner map geometry, then it could be game breaking if viper just farms her ult."
"Bind and Ascent are the only good maps atm imo.
Haven is below average and Split is STILL fucking awful."
Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment.
What's in ascent?
"Exactly, people's boner for stupid buzzwords they don't understand makes it really hard to emphasize on actually gamebreaking bugs. This one here is definitely big, but it's just a texture that doesn't load, people calling that gamebreaking are fucking stupid hilarious"
"Well said. And yeah, people seem to think it's just semantics, but it's really not. It's helpful to preserve the use of terms like 'game breaking' for actual game breaking issues. OP is crying wolf, and it makes it harder for these sorts of communities to collectively get issues noticed when language isn't a reliable metric of the severity."
can't say I disagree
Does anyone know why it’s even a rule? What could possibly be the point of that?
"You know, there is this term called ""game changing"" for things that don't quite break anything and thus are not game breaking."
He was talking about xerath
He was talking about the xerat bug
r/ihadastroke
"Just to help ya a little  
Split is the map with the gimmick of ropes  
Bind is the map with the gimmick of teleporters  
Ascent is the map with the gimmick of the closeable doors  
Haven is the map with the gimmick of 3 sites."
I think haven is the best map by a long long way
A spot
"I don't think what you're saying fits the definition of ""gamebreaking"" at all. It's not as much related to the performance on your pc but rather the game balance. Something that's gamebreaking breaks the integrity of the game's design, not your computer.

In that sense it is kind of game breaking because it makes Viper even worse than she already is. 
Like it says, it breaks the game, not the instance of the executive running on your computer.

It's kind of ironic that you are using the term incorrectly and call other people stupid for using buzzwords like these."
Now I can't run. Wonderful.
"Yeah, but it being xerath is irrelevant here, he said “for example...” meaning he’s using the xerath bug from like 2016 to backup his point about how the bug is a minor inconvenience. For one, you don’t need to cheat to recreate the bug, and two, this xerath bug ravaged soloQ and norms matches for an entire fucking week. Still don’t know how that’s a “minor inconvenience”..."
"Man what are we gonna do when the 5th map has 3 sites with teleporters, ropes, and doors?

That actually sounds like hell please don't do that riot."
"Oh gosh no. Point B is borderline useless. It essentially forces you into being pushed from 2-3 directions on a quick rotation since both A and C can rotate to it very quickly, allowing the defending team more time to plan their retake. (Assuming it’s not walled off by the defending Sage, at which point they get plenty of time to rotate as soon as they see you breaking her wall.)"
But where
"It makes literal 5000€ machines crash, it certainly is not a hardware problem"
"Making a rule where single highlights are not allowed, only well edited, longer montages are would have been too complicated I guess :))) But I don't even care anymore, trying to post to reddit is awful with the bs automods, 12 yo and or power tripping mods"
"you might want to reread the comment you replied to. you dun goofed, my friend"
The scripting part was probably talking about xerath too especially when theres proof of someone just walking up and doing the viper thing normally.
I could have swore that i read at some point that each map introduced would have its own map specific gimmick to give it variety but combining all known gimmicks could be a gimmick at some point :P
In Ascent
"No, who’s on first"

What about Ascent?
"Uh, disregard my comment, I had a brain fart

What you're describing here would be game changing bugs, but as long as nothing breaks, no client crashes, no game instance drops, there is nothing gamebreaking going on."
There's a spot
It’s a map we can’t afford to lose.

...But where??
Where?
"ok then, let's settle with agree to disagree. 

It cant be x-breaking, if x doesn't break."
Comment
Um... What the actual fuck
For some reason it reminds me of that picture of jim carrey with clear tape wrapped around his head
Her stories has more holes than her people’s cheese.
I thought Maureen Ponderosa was the cat lady.
"True story: I’m a fine dining server in Beverly Hills and years ago, I waited on her and a man that was also a walking surgical disaster. I was nice as could be but they were demanding things I could not provide for them, due to the fact that it was an authentic Italian place and there was no mayonnaise on the premises, etc. It was your typical 90210 entitlement, but taken to cartoonish levels of rude. I lost no joy in denying their requests. In her anger she told me in broken English through stiff lips that I was “hideous” and he agreed with her. “Yes” he said, “She’s right, you are absolutely hideous.” So every time I see a photo of this monster, who seems to be every bit as ugly on the inside as she is outwardly, I think of the time she told me I was hideous, and I laugh."
"She obviously wears an industrious bee hive to bed every night, just a small misunderstanding."
"Here's the [article. ](https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/catwoman-jocelyn-wildenstein-denies-having-any-plastic-surgery-cites-her-swiss-heritage)

I didn't know Swiss people looked like ogres in later life
Swiss have permanent look of anaphylaxis?
"Yeah. I’m Swiss, and I look exactly the same."
She looks like my butthole when it’s holding back a fart
"In other news, Prince Andrew can't sweat and Trump can run a country."
"Being Swiss must be hard if it makes you look like that.  Still, the flag is a big plus."
"It's true. We all look as if a murder hornet stung our faces.

Source: am Swiss"
 This honestly made me depressed. I feel bad for her.
suddenly flat earthers are reasonable
"Can confirm, everyone from Switzerland looks like this."
"Yeah, she was just born looking like The Mask, but with bone growths"
I so hoped this was the Onion
Swiss Army knife maybe.
"Ah yes, the famous plastic people of Switzerland."
"Hello, I live in a country neighboring Switzerland and can confirm that they all look like that."
She looks like a corpse that's been resown back together by somebody who's never seen a human before.
That's pretty much the quality and integrity of Fox News journalism...
Why would anyone doubt that? Perfect explanation
"Swiss heritage. Aah yes, like Swiss cheese left in an oven I guess."
Because in actuality she is a Swiss bridge troll?
TIL Swiss people look like melty plastic cats in the throes of anaphylactic shock.
"I dont understand, did her swiss heritage beat her face with rocks?"
Pete Burns is alive?!
She looks like Macaulay Culkin after he got stung by all those bees in My Girl.
"I wish I could be there when these types of people have an existential breakdown when they realize nothing matters, they're not going to live forever and they wasted tons of money on their appearance for no reason. You're still gonna die bitch, but now you're just extra ugly."
"I’m not a geographer so don’t hold me to it but by the looks of it, it seems Swiss people came from Alabama. That or she got some plastic stuffed in her face but I’m not a surgeon either"
"Lmao, she looks like a Bogdanoff"
"I'm so proud of the fact that I've never been insecure about my ugly-as-fuck mug. Working from home for 3 months now and noticeably feeling that work has gotten more productive because people respect my work more by not being distracted by my looks.

Despite all this, I'm amused by my appearance and not consumed by it. Yeh to be being in the mediocre wealth class! At least I'm thick-skinned and Botox had nothing to do with it."
TIL Khajiit are from Switzerland.
Surgery adiction is a very real and very damaging  ilness
"Obviously true. Every Swiss person I have ever met looks like they went 30 rounds with Mickey Rourke and then went to his Doctor.

She looks like a cornflake if it had skin
Yeah and my pp is not 3inch.
Oh I get it a literal 'face palm'
How does this happen
"She just shook the wrong tree and got stung by wasps. Someone give her some weeds and a wasp nest, that should fix her right up!"
why she looks like the cat when you're trying to get whatever it's been chewing
How is this woman catwoman??? cats are graceful and sophisticated creatures!!!
Looks like a peice of swiss cheese
bruh that shit's the last thing we see before we die
Didn't her husband who is/was a surgeon do all the surgery? I wonder if the denial comes from all the money he has possibly had to payout to her? I mean I'm sure I saw stories where she blamed plastic surgery for her face.
This is one of the rare posts on this sub where the person's face actually looks like a palm.
She was trying to say 'Siamese' but who the hell can tell what she's saying?
I didnt look at her face at first
I bet she can’t even ride roller coasters with that.
And a severe allergic reaction to lying
Maybe it’s flesh eating bacteria?
"She may not have had surgery, but she clearly had botox done. It's likely she had a terrible reaction to it."
Good lord she looks like she got stung by an entire beehive only on her face.
We... we dont look like that...
Keith lemon is going to need to apologise for this character
"Looks like one of Donald and Melania Trump's children, no fuckery here."
"Me: Mom i want catgirl.

"Nah, it just looks like she's allergic to nuts and had a peanut butter sandwich"
Mental problems + lots of money =
"Honest question, do people who get this much plastic surgery genuinely feel they look fine when they see themselves in a mirror? Like how anorexic people can be deathly thin but think they're fat? (I apologize if that's also not accurate)"
I was reading the article and I didn't notice the image. Sweet Jesus she looks like a witch
Jesus Murphy! She looks like she tried putting rubber bands around her face and it just stuck like that!

Her aunt was a yoghurt pot
I’m glad that I’m not part of her heritage then
Delusional
"""You wanna hear how I got these scars?""."
I didn’t  know my Dark Souls character existed in real life
"Someone get her an epipen or something, She’s obviously having an allergic reaction."
"The Swiss, as easy going as they are, are not going to like their heritage being used as a euphemism for 'bullshit'."
Switzerland must be a pretty scary place
Looking like a Bogdanov
now in no way am I Swiss but yet I am offended
Jesus Christ she looks like one of those baby dolls you think is cute growing up but creepy as an adult. EXCEPT IT'S THE LATTER 24/7.
It’s her Swiss heritage.... Swiss Army knife to the face using every tool with no mirror
She has taken the bogpill. She has ascended.
She ate wasps for breakfast no other explanation
This is just a testament to her extreme body dysmorphia
Do these people honestly think they look beautiful?
That’s like saying I only have aids because my grandpa ducked a due once in college
Which one is Jocelyn? The one of the left or the blobby thing on the right?
"why do people do this to others...

she paid ungodly amounts of money to scare people, but why? there are easier ways, just buy a mask or some shit.... smh"
"If that isn’t plastic surgery, then she should consider getting some."
Facepalm is an appropriate subreddit since her face looks like a catcher’s mitt
"She has ""I can't believe it's not plastic"" genes"
"I'm swiss, and I'm ashamed for my entire nation. We definitely don't look like this.

I mean i know i'm ugly, but *come on.*"
She looks more like Jay Leno than Jay Leno does
What causes the excessive puffiness? When a person has extensive plastic surgery they always seem to look like her. Is this the desired result? Unwanted side effects? Both?
Mental illness
This is like when the coneheads used to explain their appearance by simple saying they were French.
That's quite a burn on the Swiss people.
Straight up from the Goonies
she probably meant swiss cheese heritage. aged for a long time. full of holes. melted.
More like r/facemush
This thread has better roasts than r/roastme
"What, did someone dig up an ancestor and beat the shit out of her with a 200 year old bone?"
This just makes me sad. She has facial dysmorphia.
"Swiss heritage, huh? Yeah, I'll buy that. Melted Swiss."
Maybe shes just tragically allergic to shellfish?
She looks like when a dog accidently eats a bee
To be fair her face does look like melted cheese
Maybe her father was Jim Henson and the muppet look comes naturally?
I am Swiss and can assure you we do not look like “Billy the Puppet” from the Saw movies.
TIL the Swiss apparently look like cats
I don’t think she understands what being “Swiss” means.
Was one of her parents Swiss cheese?
Maybe it’s maybelline ...
As a Swiss person I can confirm that we all look like this.
"Lol unless 'Swiss Heritage' is the name of a plastic surgeon or a butcher, I ain't buying it."
"Thunder, Thunder, Thunder, THUNDER CATS!"
One of her ancestor was a high grade Swiss cheese block and those sleeper genes have now awaken.
"She looks like a dog with its head out of the car window, except the wind is somehow coming from over the back of her head creating a vortex in the centre of her face"
Well it’s Fox News so we know it’s not true.
Well she didn’t deny having rubber surgery
I thought she admitted that she had surgery to look like a cat. Her husband loved cats but it didn't stop him leaving for a younger woman.
"My high school in California included a section with current events in the world. 
This lady was included in it and that was 2001/2002. 

There is something wrong with her.  18+ years after she became known for having surgery like this and talking freely to news outlets about it, she suddenly decides she's going to say it's because she's Swiss?"
Her face always really scares me  and I feel so bad bc she just want’s to look good. Total body dysmorphia
"As a swiss person, I have never felt so insulted..."
It looks like she needs plastic surgery.
How do you pay for plastic surgery only to look like a hemorrhoid infested asshole?
There is more plastic in her face than in the ocean
"If she wasn’t lying, then I’d say God needs to lay off the randomize button on the character creator"
If she did facepalm I’m pretty sure more plastic would come out of her face than plastic in the ocean.
Funny because her plastic surgeon also denies ever having touched her.
Maybe it’s the fact she has a bee hive in her mouth
Swiss cheese heritage
I can confirm. All swiss people look like this.
Imagine living with her and every corner you turn in the house you dont know if she will be there or not.. your life would be like a horror movie
Do all Swiss people age like they're allergic to bee stings?
Right...because Swiss heritage makes your face swell up like you got attacked by a swarm of bees.
"""I didn't steal chocolate cookies from the jar!"" Said the kid with cookie crumbles and chocolate all over his lips whilst he is quickly chewing and swallowing the last bite of his fifth cookie"
"Hey, isn’t she that woman Peter tried to use to scare Meg out of a relationship with Quagmire?"
Maybe it's babybel?
"Swiss here and yes we all look like this, gopfätammi"
Looks like she got atacked by a platoon of wasps
To be fair she does look like a block of cheese.
"Well then, she needs some."
She also got her brain cosmetically smoothed because she didn't find the bumps appealing. Hence the claim.
"Kill it with fire.

^(/s because some people have the iq of moldy peanutbutter.)"
We got your test results back. I'm afraid it's... Swiss Heritage.
Trumps next press secretary here.
She looks like me that one time I got stung by a wasp. Have I mentioned I'm extremely allergic to wasps?
That's what all Swiss people look like
"She clearly hasn't done any plastic surgery. Can't believe she has to make it so obvious for people, smh. No one's face can just swoll up like that with plastic surgery. It has to be genetics."
"you see, but i doubt she does"
Confusion of the highest order!
Yikes
is this lady related to swiss cheese?
She looks like Chucky
"Jesus Christ, if that woman does a facepalm she gonna burst."
FTIL: The Elephant Man was Swiss....
"Swiss have wares, if you have coin..."
"I used to, too."
Ok.
She looks like dasboschitt after he had his surgery
Was her surgeon Swiss?
Looks like she got hit by murder hornets
Swiss cheese
Lol
She looks like one of the toys from small soldiers
She looks so digusting it makes me want to use emojis
"My mother is Swiss and she sure as hell doesn’t look like this! 
Although she is obsessed with cats."
Kajiit
Maybe an anaphylactic reaction...
The good old Habsburg genes
Why does she look like someone went into photoshop and decided to have a stroke halfway through
Who?
I bet her claims caused bigger uproar in Switzerland than WW2.

She looks like when Gumball does the weiner dog expression.
There are before and after pictures of her all over the iinternet. Nut job.
Seems legit enough
How the actual hell does a plastic surgeon fuck that much up
It looks like she has plastic surgery
Swiss Feline-looking dumbass is her heritage
Fronk!!!
This has to be considered a mental disorder
He knows?
Could she be having done more surgeries

Her fiance: 

“*I don’t understand the whole press and the Catwoman thing, because Jocelyn always looked like that, She never really did anything to change her face. I have pictures from 16 years old where she looks exactly the same as today.*”


And "" *She credits her “high cheekbones and long hair” with her background.*"" 

After that she says:

“*No, especially when we look back at my pictures - I think of course I am maybe more beautiful [back then], When we are young there’s a certain freshness we lose with the years. But you still find the same eyes, same high cheeks or same nose. I think I was more pretty.*”"
Yes her mother was a Swiss cheese
"Excuse me, what the fuck?"
can I get a picture of someone with swiss heritage to compare... Please
Perhaps her dad tucked a rotten swiss check
Why you *look* like dat den.
That is an AFFRONT to the good people of Switzerland!
Does... does she blink?
"Well, I have never seen Swiss people soooo all Swiss look like that……????"
"With those aged hands, I’m serious."
What’s with the nickname?
maybe she's born with it
She looks like she head butted a wasp nest
Maybe she let bees sting her and the Hulk smash her face!
She must be related to the Trumps. Believing their own lies...:
It’s her Swiss heritage.
Severe body dysmorphia. They dont see themselves in the same way that you can see them.

About a decade ago she looked like a human/lion hybrid.

I had no idea until now that the cat transition character arc was actually loosely based on actual events. I thought they were just satirizing transgenderism through the lense of transspeciesism (if that is a word).

It’s the only way to make yourself look like Robert Z’Dar.
i mean... obviously she looks horrendous but i wouldnt have guessed she’s an 80 year old woman. at least she had some good years before getting all the surgeries
Wait so she has a fiancé and I don’t?
She lives in Trump Tower. This is exactly the kind of person I’d expect to live there
It's sad. She probably has a mental disorder.

Even in his sleep Zuko is still begrudging to affection!
Notice Toph's foot on Zuko's back it's cute it feels like she's watching him without him knowing it lmao
"Can we all acknowledge the fact that everyone, including Aang and Zuko, chose to cuddle up to Sokka? Like he is 100% the center of this cuddle party."
This made my heart feel all warm and fuzzy. I wanna dive in and be a part of this cuddle party.
The way Toph cuddles Sokka is the fucking most adorable thing.
I love that Sokka's cuddling with EVERYbody.
"Beautiful, but where's Suki snuggling with Sokka? Can't leave out Appa or Momo either"
Someone's missing. Someone very important where's momo ?
Adorbs. Love how Kataang is holding each other
For a second I thought: 'WHAT I DONT REMEMBER THIS I CANT BELIEVE I MISSED THIS!!' But it's just fanart or fart for short.
Gladly sell my soul to see them like this more
"they had such awesome chemistry.


too bad such chemistry wasn't seen in LoK. their friendship was all over the place and failed to capture the ""gang magic""."
I love how toph is snuggling sokka
Instead of continuing avatar as a graphic novel I wish they just continued the show I only watched avatar a couple weeks ago and I loved it
WHERES SUKI
"The funny thing is that from the art styles to the poses, I can *totally* see this happening, lol."
Adorable out of ten. Would watch a sleeping time lapse.
This picture helps remind me that they’re all just in their teens. It gets harder and harder to remember as ATLA goes on because of how much power and responsibility these kids have
Where's suki
"If Suki was in the picture, I feel like she would be on Sokka’s right shoulder with an arm around Zuko and Toph"

Zuko is so small

"Although Zuko is older, Sokka is like the big brother of the group. It just melts my heart"
"Awwwwww, they sleep in a pile."
I love how Sokka Is the pillow and Toph looks like she is hogging all the cover
What episode is this from?
Aang definitely didn’t die?
"In Sokka's words:""Where is Suki?"""
Suki too
Good to see that even when sleeping Toph is keeping an eye on Zuko
I guess it’s just hard to match ATLA

You look them right in the kokoro

Uhhh. They're fictional characters dude. I definitely wouldn't die for them lol

this picture immediately made me think of that fic! thanks for linking it so I could relive the wholesomeness
That’s the first non-fiction I read and finished in years. Thank you
"Oh boy, do I have a theory for you.

So, if you haven’t seen Legend of Korra, Toph has two daughters by different fathers. One of the fathers is known,  if the other was kept secret by Toph. The daughter of the mystery man, Suyin, does bear a resemblance to Sokka, but the most solid evidence is in her children. They all do have some resemblance to Sokka as well, but her son Baatar Jr. looks strikingly similar to adult Sokka. So the theory is that Sokka and Suki hit a rough patch and then he and Toph did the nasty, resulting in Suyin. Hence why Toph won’t reveal the father, probably to preserve Sokka’s memory. Pretty dark but very intriguing."

"It's not ""designed to fail,"" it is ""Holy shit how can you shoot that guy, let him use his earnings And continue a risky life. U can clearly see the tips twist toward each other, then deleted it and then just went to look it up"
"Soul, not unlike those characters, is fictional."
"Agreed, I liked Korra but there was never awesome gang energy, also asami was barley in the series"
"That is, in my opinion, the number one problem with Korra. Even if you think the group dynamic happened, it took a looong time to get there. I think that the lack of the same group dynamic is mostly why some people that liked ATLA dislike LOK, even if they don’t consciously realize it. Caring about characters is how we connect to a world and story, after all."
Maybe it’s an age thing. ATLA has younger kids in there so the friendship was more focused and easier where in LOK everyone is of a more....sexual age? And we all know how that is in highschool/college. I found it realistic that a group of attractive young adults kept dating one another because it’s what would happen in any other setting. Look at that 70s Show. I’d try to shoot my shot with Asami and/or Bolin if I was in the group lol
"Aside from Korra (and Tenzin if you count him to the team), nobody in the group really had an overarching goal and motivation. It makes sense if you consider that all the characters were built for a mini series of 12 episodes. But it's still really weak writing."
"I don’t think we needed gang magic in Korra. Korra was a different animal, we didn’t need a gang again."
Korra's main cast didn't have the gang magic but I totally loved how close she was to Tenzin and his children.
Solid disagree with you there.
"I been a live for 30 years sleeping inside. Went to army and had to sleep in the desert. Away from the whole shit experience of being in the army. Sleeping outside was dope. I felt free, staring at night sky and stars is charming way to doze off. I have to say tho that where i was we had no sneaks or bugs. So if that what you are referring too then that a total different thing that i had never experienced and wish i don't."
ZUKKA
It's fanart.
From the pencil of a fan.
That is Sokka’s hand. Aang’s is probably somewhere under Katara’s hair
It‘s Sokkas arm
Things must not be taken in a literal way all the time
Sokka’s hand. You can see Aang’s left under his right arm.
I'd die for no reason so why not ig
It's called a figure of speech...
He isn’t being literal
"yea, he is definitely getting the raw end of this deal - sleeping in Sokka's armpit with Toph's foot on his back"
Have the Gaang give Zuzu a Big Snuggly Hug 2020!
She’s 100% about to kick him ‘by accident’
"I don't know how to explain it, but I don't think he means watching him like with apprehension. I think like, I don't know, but it's from a place of love?

Besides, she can only really ""see"" when her feet touch the ground, so she's probably only feeling him with her left, and ""seeing"" him with her right."
Appa totally liked him first.
he actually is the real leader if you think about it
"Suki, Ty Lee and the moon...Sokka pulls 100% of the time, all the time."
"Gaang when they’re kids, Boomeraang when they’re 30+"
[great comment! Very good and funny!](https://i.imgur.com/93fNzq3.jpg)
Niiiice.
Kiss kiss kiss kiss
Sokka Bear
"Get out of the bison’s mouth, Sokka!"
*gasp* and Momo ate Appa
"...and then momo got revenge in their duel years later. Both bearded now and older.... Wiser.... Angrier.

The duel will be legendary and will shape the world of Avatar for years to come."
I knew this day would come !
"Sokka, get out of the Bison’s mouth!"
"Doesn't even have to be dark betrayal, maybe they all agreed to try something new and it went so badly that they all agreed never to speak of it again. Or maybe that kind of act is extremely taboo in that world.

But now that I read this I have to re-watch LoK"
"I always felt sorry for Toph in that theory. It essentially says she was willing to get with Sokka at the drop of a hat, and then he just ditches afterwards. She'd have had an unrequited crush on him for decades."
"Personally I think Satoru from the comics is Suyin's father. They have similar curly hair.

But I don't mind if it's Sokka."
Well suki and sokka did break up in one of the comics as well as zuko and mai so it makes sense
I only wish i knew
It doesn't help that there was nothing consistent about Korra's personality. She was cool in season 1 and then they made her insufferable.
"Eh i care about the characters of LoK, without a group dynamic. They didn’t need to make the same show twice. I didn’t need a group dynamic. She made friends with people who went off to do other things."
"oh no dating and crushes aren't the problem in LoK. ATLA had plenty of infatuation, crushes and flirting. sokka, my man is perfect example of that.

its just that LoK didn't have character development and progression. their struggles and motivations weren't relatable to viewers. everything was disjointed and chaotic. hey i want to be pro bender player. hey i want to be a detective. hey i want to serve under kuvira. it just doesn't seem to work at all."
"The fact that Korra didn’t know if it was getting renewed each season certainly gave it issues with potential long term arcs, and that showed. I wonder what Korra would’ve been if we got a commitment to all 4 seasons from the get go."
not even character building? LoK characters were totally unrelatable to viewers. their motivations ang goals weren't highlighted properly either. very shallow character development and progression imo
No just no
I just noticed that his arm is below his other arm
Damn
"Perhaps you should see a therapist, then, because I don't think that is a healthy attitude."
It means that OP feels really connected to them because they are written in a nearly perfect way.
Not literally mate
Toph feels vibrations with her foot. What is she listening too through Zuko
That's just how she shows affection! :P
"> I don't know how to explain it, but I don't think he means watching him like with apprehension

Watching OVER him."
Aang liked him in the Blue Spirit
Being the son of a chief and all. *”I’m kinda like a prince myself”*
Off topic: was the day of black sun a gift from Yue?
Nice
And appa ate  Suki.
"Get out of the lemur’s mouth, Sokka!"
"Oh no, I always knew Suki was kind of a freak."
its taboo in the real world too unless they broke up
They never broke up in the comics. At then end of imbalance (the most recent one) they’re still together.
"Maybe it's also an age thing. We know that Korra is 17 years old in series, Aang was 12-13ish. Its reasonable to believe that younger members seeked out friendship, but teenagers were instead involved with forming romantic relationships."
"even their romances were all over the place. the constant flip flopping and then rushed korrasami angle didn't helped the matter one bit.

LoK isn't ATLA but LoK isn't good character building either which every good story needs."
"Yea like you said, it had flirting and crushes but those are childish. LOK dealt with full on relationships like that age group would do. Sokka being one of the few characters who has multiple relationships is again because he is of that age! Young adults date, a lot! You can’t put 6 teens in a classroom before they’re switching partners lol I mean again, why is everyone disgusted at the very realistic and natural growing these characters do on the show? It’s not the same as Aang crushing on katara for 3 seasons, he was 12. 

I’d say Korra going from wide eyed country girl to a fully realized avatar who suffers from severe PTSD, changed the entire Avatar cycle and world and finally found someone to share life with was character development. Y’all act like LOK wasn’t the darkest children’s show at the time. It was realistic just as much as ATLA was, it had older characters and darker plots. Also as someone pointed out before, Nick kept the creators on a thin line so they had to close each season like it was the last. They never knew what the story could flow to be. So yea, it’s a little jarring every season."
What toph is a little too young
"Feels overdramatic, in my opinion. I guess hyperbole is an art I do not understand."
"Of course literally or they wouldn't downvote this guy. Why so much hate for someone who simply asked a question? Precisely because they're serious and they're being literal. Literal or not it's cringey as fuck to say ""I would die for those characters"", that's only a tv show, don't make it your whole life..."
Fire
Shes making sure he's ok
honor
"Yes, that works!"
He was wondering if they could be friends but he still didn't trust or accept him in their group yet.
Shiiieeeet..  I didn't think of that
Noice
I mean sokka wasn't so bad either with a rose in his mouth
Evident by that one time she put a makeshift ball gag on a prison warden
"Yeah, which comic? I just read them recently"
"Rushed? Their friendship was off to a rocky start in Season 1. Season 2 showed they friendship become rock solid and Season 3 pushed it even further.

Season 4 progressively showed them being closer and closer starting with the letters that happened in between season 3 and 4."
"dude, suki going to sokkas tent in the middle of the night with sokka sitting in sexy pose is pretty much the peak of hint what was about to go down that night. ATLA had plenty of kisses too.

nobody is disgusted by relationships shown in LoK. its the lack of depth and way they showed it in. constant flip flopping between marko - korra and marko - asami without any real substance. to top it off, we get korrasami out of the blue when there was nothing romantic ever shown between the two until the final episodes of season 4.

the character development. their motivations. their struggles. everything is very shallow in LoK. several single element benders easily defeat korra who has four elements at her disposal after getting trained by masters. the plot armor in LoK is really jarring and totally unbelievable at some instances. 

weak story writing and boring characters are the most glaring problems in LoK"
Korra wasn't the darkest children's show at the time because young justice was out. I do think Korra's arc is 2nd in the series only to Zuko.
"Yup this is what I try to tell everybody. Comparing friendships with 12-14 yr olds and with 17-18 yrs old is not correct. LOK did show their relationship very realistically. I've seen how relationships and friendships happen in High School and college life. Very similar. 

Gaang's friendship thing was very naive and simple. That's also realistic. Kids of that age are like that. Which is why relationship in Sokka's case was a little different. He was about 16, the same high school kid age. But he was with younger kids so his behavior was obviously a little different. Whereas LOK is basically all young adults hanging out with each other. Both the shows' friendship thing is written very realistic. 

Although if LOK was given a 4 season from the beginning, I think it would have been better. I mean see season 3 and 4 were given together and we know how good those 2 were. People like Gaang's friendship because it's simple. But they don't like Korra's because it isn't simple. Both are realistic."
3 years isn’t much.  My sisters dad is over 5 years older than my mum
What does it sound like?
Yeah that's what I thought. Just listening closely. She knows zuko will be the first one to bolt up of there's danger around
You wouldn't wonder if you could be friends unless you liked someone on some level.
Nice
"Keep in mind that there wasn't a single homosexual couple depicted in the whole series apart from korrasami, i.e. we can assume that their society is not yet accepting of the notion. Therefore, the relationship would have to be much more pronounced befeore even the both of them could accept it. As it is, it went from ""you're my only friend who I can confide in"" (which could as well be just because Asami was Korra's only female friend of the same age) to ""I want to be with you and I know you want it too"" which, while plausible, was not depicted in any way on screen. We're just left to assume that that whole development happened entirely via letters, which the audience doesn't have access to.


The golden rule of cinema is ""Show, don't tell"", and, as far as I'm concerned, they just tell the audience ""Oh btw we are kinda together now"" without showing anything."
Friendship is very different than a full ok relationship. The writers have said they were very restricted in what they could depict. That meant that an actual relationship couldn’t be shown between them and it wasn’t. They were only shown as friends up until the end. Retroactively you can go back and say they were more but that’s not what first time viewers see. Compare Korra and Asami’s relation ship to any of their relationship with the guys. That’s what people will be comparing them to as they watch the show.
"I agree it was a rocky start season 1, but I just watched season 2 and Korra and Asami barely interacted. 2 way different storylines and they only were together as a group with others. There was basically no development in season 3 and then it was rushed in season 4."
"season 1-2 was full of flip flop between marko - korra and marko - asami. constant tug of war of that love triangle.

season 3 had korra and asami as working friendship relationship. there was never any hint of any romantic feelings between the two. near the final episodes of season 3, korra and marko hug each other and they part awkwardly showing that they still have feelings for each other.

in season 4, korra writes to asami as pen pals/friends. she describes her struggles and trauma but never writes about she having any feelings for her nor asami writes anything about her feelings towards her. they just write about each others struggles and current political climate of earth kingdom. even through out season 4 the majot theme is about korra dealing with her trauma. no where did they showed how korra - asami love blossomed and how it progressed. their love is just thrown in viewers face like ""here, this is korrasami. it suddenly happened. like it or not. cya""

there was absolutely no character build up of their relationship neither there was any prior hints of them being infatuated by each other."
I mean aged up is fine but canon ages is creepy kinda
Yeah Katara is older than Aang by a couple of years this isn't much different.
"""HONOOOOR!"""
Bhhhhhhhhfrhghhyyyggyhhhhuuuhhhhonorvjygcrfxfhhjhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Fwoosh
"""LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVE!"""
"This is due to the time the show was made. The writers confirmed KorrAsami and said they were only allowed to go so far.

ATLA was even worse as it came before.

Not many kids shows had gays or interracial couples in that time."
"According to the Korra comics ""their"" society atleast the Air Nomads society were already very open about the homosexuality notion. Because we know Aang's daughter Kaya was. Avatar Kyoshi was. Also when Kaya was explaining about her past to Korrasami, she mentioned how Aang was perfectly fine with it and how it was a very accepted thing among Air Nomads and then a picture of a random air nomad gay couple was shown.
The creators are able to show because of ""our"" society has come a long way ahead now but couldn't include a lot during that time when the series aired."
"I felt like it was lacking too but the creators did slip in something that would have been difficult to show more, in season 3 while Korra was recovering I remember a conversation about Korra and Asami writing a lot, so in a sense we didn't get to what could have been more romantic building through several letters. I could also be remembering wrong because it's a while, need to go watch again."
"I remember when LOK originally aired, and people starting seeing something between Korra and Asami towards the end of season 3. There was a good bit of chatter in the discussion threads about how they had the most chemistry, they should just ditch Mako and get with each other, etc. First time viewers could definitely get the vibe so..."
"As a first time viewer myself as of two weeks ago I saw the relationship grow.

Not sure how you were blind to it."
"I mean...she was. Her knee jerk reaction to pretty much every problem was ""slaughter everyone and make them fear me!"", the only reason she didn't until the final season was because there was always someone to reign her in (Missandei, Jorah, Tyrion, etc.) as soon as no one was around to stop her, she snapped.

Now I'm not defending the final season because it was a dumpster fire, but the whole ""she went insane out of nowhere!"" argument is silly."
"Never watched Game Of Thrones so that reference makes no sense to me.

And get a grip? For seeing something others didn’t?

Lmao, grow up and let people have their own opinions and interpretations of things.

Pathetic."
"Just watch season 4 again and you will see the signs. They are everywhere. I watched TLA and TLoK with a friend, who never saw the show before and he noticed all the signs of Korrasami in season 4 and hoped for them to get together."
Well it was probably a one sided thing until they got older
That video gives me so much joy. Those hip thrusts get me every time.
Underrated comment right here
Leaf me alone
"That is your personal head cannon though. You could literally say the same about stuff like Toph and Sokka, or Zuko and Katara, and neither of those were actual relationships."
Seems like you need to rewatch the show lmao
"Lmao people with schizophrenia also see things others don't, retard."
"i rewatched whole LoK series previous week and what i felt by watching it is what i wrote in my previous comment

edit - can you describe what signs in season 4 hint towards romantic feelings between korra and asami?"
Maybe but suki and sokka were stil happy
"Thanks for pointing it out, I almost didn't notice."
"156 updoots in an hour and almost quadruple its parent, doesn't seem underrated to me."
Leaves from the vine...
"Neither of those had actual stuff happen though?

Toph only kissed Suki because of the whole “you saved my life” deal and she thought it was Sokka. Died of embarrassment after. This was the only case of anything “romantic” for them two and it wasn’t even romantic.

Zuko and Katara only related in the caves due to losing their mothers. That’s it. Nothing more was shown.

Korra and Asami has way more happening.

You being blind to it doesn’t change the fact it was there.

Also, I’m an empath so I get a lot more sense to these types of things others normally don’t get."
"Nope, maybe you do. Here are some examples. It's easy to dismiss her violent tendencies because they are usually directed at ""the bad guys"", but it doesn't change that her first solution to most problems is ""murder anyone who disagrees with me"".

Beginning of Season 2, she threatens to nuke Qaarth outside the gates when she doesn't get her way. She does it again in the same season when threatening the Spice King.

She threatened to slaughter everyone in Yunkai and told the masters that not doing so already was ""her gift"" to them.  

She burned all the slave masters in Astapor after striking a deal with them.

She crucified the old masters of Mereen over a hundred mile stretch making signposts out of them.

""They can live in my new world, or they can die in their old one.""  

She fed more masters to her dragons to threaten the remaining ones into compliance. 

She burned all the Khals with a smile on her face.

""If you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive.""

She burned everyone that should could have instead taken prisoner (like the Tarlys)

""You need to inspire a degree of fear,"" Tyrion agreed. ""But fear is all Cersei has. It's all my father had, and Joffrey. It makes their power brittle, because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead.""

""Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way with fear,"" she replied.

She's literally following the Mad King's example at that point."
Yeah
Lmao I swear it was underrated before it become rated
Yeah when I put that it had like 26 updoots but I didn't wanna edit my comment and look like a total dumby dumb lol
"No its hinted at through most of the series that Toph had a crush on Sokka, most of Korra and Asami was literally off screen."
Except you didn't block me. lmao Yikes kiddo.
But im stil a tokka shipper at heart

Why do people use Hashtag on Reddit? They don't do anything as far as I can tell
WOW! I’ve been thru that area. SEVERAL times. It’s a nightmare even on good days.
Looking at the traffic jam reminded me of that one story where this father left his car and ran home to make it in time for his daughter’s birthday.
"https://youtu.be/hnRuWcgflaE

Why are the top two comments about defecation. Wtf
Yo I'm with you but I got to get to work to feed my family.
Yikes! Hopefully nobody is in a hurry to get to where they're going
How many of those cars you think had their gas light on before they entered the highway
This is nothing like the Floyd case. This dude took a taser from a cop and tased them with it. Come on man. Come on.
"He did not need to die, but these people should not be protesting because of his death. The man was passed out and intoxicated in a Wendy's drive thru.  When he was told he was being arrested for DUI, he fought both officers, took their taser, and began firing it at them while running.  He was dangerous to the officers, and people around him. [Bodycam footage](https://youtu.be/hnRuWcgflaE)

George Floyd and Breonna Taylor should be getting everyones attention, and people should definitely still be protesting for them."
"Good job guys. You made it so that anyone needing to use that road in an emergency situation is completely fucked. Fire trucks, ambulances, good cops, and citizens responding to or in an emergency are unable to move. This should be a banned form of protest because it could endanger lives."
"Look, I am all in with the black lives matter movement and I sincerely believe that our police and justice systems need serious reform, but this particular case was justified. The guy grabbed the officer's taser, after drunk driving, mind you, and pointed it at the officer after refusing to let them cuff him. The officers were totally professional up to that point. Stuff like this totally undercuts the message and makes the movement harder to be taken seriously. It's really a shame. We can talk about whether or not I believe police should be able to even use lethal force ever, with the exception of dire situations, like the UK police. But in this instance, play stupid games win stupid prizes. And shutting down a major interstate?! Do you just want people to hate you? Come on. This is not the way."
"  Is Brooks the guy who resisted arrest, stole a taser, ran from the cops and then pointed the taser at the cops? Get mad all you want, but that was justified."
i saw the video. the cops were completely justified
"Nothing stops racial injustice like stopping your fellow community from going anywhere, and then burning innocent people’s’ cars and a restaurant that happened to be where the even took place.
Man they showed those cops!"
Did a judge decide he was murdered or is it just OP?
I completely agree with protesting for a good cause but why make the other people's lives harder? Many of them just want to go home to be with their families after a long day at work
"That’s tucking bullshit. That’s why BLM and protestors can’t be taken seriously by everybody. 

Ideally I am in favor of the protests but when you protest over the murder of Rayshard Brooks, a drunk guy that he was in his car, resisted arrest, wrestled two cops, stole a taser and blank pointed at an officer you can’t expect to deliver the “another innocent black man killed by racist cops” agenda and be believed by anyone who watched police dash cams that you can easily find it on YouTube."
Like why tho?
"Didnt he resist arrest and then point the taser he took from the cops at them. most likely he was driving drunk because he failed a sobriety test and then wrestled with the cops when he was being placed under arrest. Maybe they should defund the police so people like rayshard can drive drunk and kill innocent people on the road.

Edit: to all the people defending him, just remember this could all have been avoided if he wasn't driving drunk or resisted arrest."
"Ya wow, blocking traffic and pissing people off isnt going to win anyone over.

But this is reddit, social media, and facts be damn when emotions are everything. 

Two hearts and zero brains."
"What's the point of stopping all the traffic and all these innocent people who didn't have anything to do with the murder in the first place? Some are parents coming home from work to see their kids and look after them and cook dinner. Some are other believers in your cause who would happily join in if they knew what was going on but they think it's just another traffic jam. Some are women in labor desperately needing to get to the hospital. Hell, some are emergency service vehicles on their way to do a job. What's the point!? You're doing more harm than good to protest more harm being done than good. It's a never-ending cycle. It's pointless. Go home."
[deleted]
I-75 always looks like that
"The drunk dude that attacked two cops? Dont grab an officers weapon, you won't end up dead. Pretty simple no matter how many highways retards decide to block."
All those ppl just wanna go home.
Imagine being all the way in the back and not knowing what’s really happening and you think you’ve just landed in the worst traffic of your life
What good is shutting down an interstate going to do
my friend's neighbour in atlanta didnt make it to hospital in time because protesters were blocking the roads
"Rayshard Brooks resisted arrest, wrestled with officers, stole a taser and shot it at officers while running away. Not at all the same case as George Floyd lol"
"What's this do, nothing. Go shut down the courthouse or town hall. Shutting down the highways is just silly."
Rayshard Brooks had taken one of the police officers tasers and shot it at them. I wouldn’t say it was murder but what would you do in that situation?
"Protesters should have no rights to shut down a major freeway. It impedes safe and orderly travel and also creates a situation for tempers to flare and unrest to proceed. I also don’t like that they set the Wendys on fire which seems to be a case of arson. While media has said that Rayshard Brooks was unarmed, he became armed as soon as he stole a taser, resisted arrest, and assaulted an officer. While I support #BLM due to the statistics of blacks killed by law enforcement are disproportionately higher, I can’t condone the actions of Rayshard Brooks or the decision to use deadly force against him with other innocent bystanders in the parking lot when he was on foot and impaired by alcohol."
"So, let me get this right. Someone called 911 because a man was passed out in his car at a Wendy's drive thru. Cops show up, he fails the sobriety test, starts to get arrested and decides the best option is to fight the cops, steal a taser gun, run, then turn and aim the taser at the police and pull the trigger? And now people are protesting? Do people not use common sense anymore? Stop fighting the police and shit like this won't happen. If I got a dwi, its my fault and I'm going to jail. This isn't police brutally. This is criminals being stupid"
racism = destroyed
Protesting a justified shooting is a great way to help your cause /s
"Well being from Atlanta that just looks like a Tuesday  at 6pm, or 3pm, or 4am. Pre-covid."
Why is there so much space bw cars
"In my experience, that’s pretty standard 75 traffic through Atlanta."
"This is a bad idea... protesters need to build support. Closing down I-75 will not help the cause. Yes, you want to get attention, but not that kind of attention."
This is why cars need inflatable bumpers to push protestors OUT of your way unharmed so they can't scream and yell like a bunch of children when a car tries to pull away.
wHy dID thE caRs dRivE ovEr uS
Y'all badass! We got tear gassed in Philly for doing this. We need more highway blocking!
# test
For some reason this sub is really touchy about people standing in the road
I'm just glad I don't live in America. What a shithole.
Break out the gas then. This isn’t a peaceful protest anymore.
Ah yes stop traffic on the highway causing a potentially deadly situation. So peaceful you guys.
"Imagine thinking that police killing any black person is racist because you don’t want to watch 5 minutes of bodycam footage, getting an officer fired who uses that job to support his family."
"Rayshard wrestled the cop, failed his sobriety test, and then stole the cops taser(not in that order) this was justified. Even so, these retarded ass virtue signalers think they are national heroes for fucking up thousands of people's day. The ""special"" people are ruining the protests for everybody."
"This old, they got their photo and then left.

(literally, they all put their fists up, posed, got up and about 3 minutes later cars were flowing)"
Bunch of idiots tbh. Those are innocent people trying to go about their daily lives.
This guy went for an officers weapon. This is out of hand. Send the guard in.
This isn’t a freak out it’s a movement
"I'm soooooo pro colonize Mars. Want to stop people from going to/preforming work, getting to the hospital, meeting family, grocery shopping etc... let's just move and start over lol"
Imagine blocking i-75 for no reason.
"Protesting is ok, being a huge nuisance and blocking off roads is not"
What a great way to get people to get behind you’re movement
"This was not murder, the fact that almost no one is disagreeing with OP’s title is really disturbing.

Brooks was drunk and pass out in his car. The cops then attempt to arrest him for DUI and he resists. Brooks then grabs one of the officer’s taser and run off shooting at the other officer with the taser as he runs away. It was at this point he was shot.

"I dont like this, i just really hope that no one that is stuck in traffic right now is an emergency responder, or someone who was on their way to the hospital. I understand the cause but there is a good chance that someone that is stuck in traffic there needs immediate medical attention."
Didn’t he point the stun gun at the cop? If so then the killing is probably justified.
"I get it, protest all you want. You dont have to fuck up other people's day though."
"My first thought when I see these highway/ interstate stops are what if a woman was going into labor on the way to the hospital... this isnt the right way to protest, you could potentially be putting lives at risk. I'm all for protesting, especially for equality, but this is just f**king stupid."
"I will never understand why americans think that it's okay to protest on a highway and block traffic. If you are trying to fuck over someone, then at least do it to someone who deserves it and not to your fellow citizens smh"

That's why blocking traffic for protest is not considered peaceful protest. It's illegal
In other countries whenever traffic is stopped like this you have to leave room for emergency vehicles. The folks in the left lane move over to the left and the folks in the next lane in hug the right side of their lane. This would never work here because it requires drivers to consider people other than themselves and that's just not something we Americans are very good at.
"Exactly. Do you think anyone waiting in that line for hours is now going to change their way of thinking?

If anything it ingrains their thinking even more. 

This isn’t a productive way to bring attention to any matter."
"If PublicFreakout has taught me anything it's that this sub will root for motorists over protestors every time, even when motorists are straight up running over protestors and killing them.  It's kinda weird.

Why do you think they couldn't make way for an ambulance?

(edit: I remember being in this sub back on the day of that Charlottesville Unite the Right rally, when that guy plowed his Dodge Charger into like a dozen people from behind.  At that time, the death toll had not come in but it looked like he had killed several people.   Videos of the attack and the aftermath were pouring into this sub.  The top comments were ""Play Stupid Games Win Stupid Prizes,"" ""Next Time Don't Walk In the Road"", ""He Felt Threatened"", etc.    The sentiment didn't change until several days later when people learned the attack was premeditated. )"
"Did this happen, or are you just making up hypothetical scenarios?"
So what you really mean is: “I can’t believe the cops keep extrajudiciously murdering people thus necessitating social unrest and discomfort as a response.”
"Why did you say ""I am probably gonna get downvoted for this but honestly""?  Can't you just post your opinion?  Who cares if it's ""voted up"" or ""voted down""?"

That's the point though. Protests need to create some form of tangible pressure to achieve anything and in our society economic pressure is most effective. Think of the millions of dollars not generated during this period.

"Apparently, everyone there has diarrhea."
It’s Atlanta. Everyone’s in a hurry but you always plan for traffic.

That's your take?? I'm like yo hopefully that killer faces justice. But I guess everyone is more worried about the people stuck in traffic and poop stuff.
"It is banned, it's a felony to block the interstate"
"Damn, sounds like we should give in to their demands so we can stop having this conversation."
In many protests like this when there is an emergency vehicle everyone moves over.  they don’t just let people die if they’re in an ambulance.  For context I live near Pittsburgh and there was protests that blocked Pittsburgh highways and when ambulances or emergency vehicles came through they would let them through.
"Protesters frequently move for emergency vehicle, maybe not cops since they are specifically protesting against them. There are other routes that emergency vehicles can take, dispatch is aware of the shutdown and will send vehicles accordingly.

This is the same as if the freeway were shut down for construction. Emergency vehicles work around it."
"I think we've gotten a point where any white cop/black suspect homicide is going to be labeled as racist and unjustified, regardless  of the facts."
Right? Steal a cops weapon and aim at him and its completely your own fault when you get shot
Ding ding ding.
how does that justify murder? cops should be smart enough that drunk men can’t steal their tazers in the first place.
This guy could've gone to jail and been out in less than a day.
Didn't they shoot him in the back?
Why?
"Would you or I have been justified shooting someone in that situation?

Would you or I have been justified shooting a cop in that situation?

If yes to both, then the shooting was justified."
Explain plz
The only people who said the officer was guilty was the mayor of Atlanta. The GBI investigation already shows that he did fire the taser at the officer. The officer will most likely be cleared of any wrong doing by Tuesday.
"> but why make the other people's lives harder?

It sucks, but with no actual means to fight the police non-violently the next best option is to shut down society and make everyone's life hell until the powers that be start fixing problems."
Protests are meant to be disruptive. That's the point.
Because some people's familiy members never came home.

Some of you Americans are so willing to allow the police to kill. I can't explain how bizarre your statement is for an outsider.
He shot the taser and missed though. So he had nothing left - the cop had a legal reason to shoot but I don’t think he should’ve.
There are police forces all over the world that could have effectively handled that situation without murdering the man. Drinking and driving is a crime but it's not a crime necessarily deserving of death... You fucking psychopath.

"Didn’t just point the taser at them, he fired it at the police officer. He also didn’t just resist arrest, he physically assaulted the officers."

He was initially asleep in the car. How does that get escalated into a shooting. So much has to happen between waking up and getting shot.
Well they also burned down the Wendy’s where this happened so there’s that.
it made the news didn't it?  seems like it's getting the attention they wanted
Common sense isn't common
Yeah you're right but the anti cop hate brigade is out in full force.
"Dude, are you serious, how was it justified? I mean, yes, he was drunk driving which puts countless innocents in danger... Yes, he assaulted officers, and yes, he put innocents in danger when he stole, and tried to use, a taser, but why did the cops have to shoot him. Why couldn't the officers have done what Harry Potter did (this is the book we reference to address all social issues) by simply disarming the man, either with kung fu, or maybe just nice words? As a non American, I can't believe that you would justify allowing police to kill citizens... In my totally homogenous country, where there's no crime and everyone contributes to society instead of taking away from it, the police are like our friends...america should emulate those aspects, and I certainly think that even when people continually commit crime and create harmful circumstances, there should be no pushback on them, because that's just not nice."

"You can't shoot someone who is running away and claim ""self defense"""
So you're saying using a non-lethal weapon on a cop allows them to use lethal weapons on you and kill you? Also shoot in the parking lot with bystanders all around?
"If this was a white rich college kid who did exactly the same, would he have been shot like this? I don’t think so. This guy didn’t rob a bank, he was drunk and fell asleep on a Wendy’s, he should have taken an uber home not leave in a body bag. The fact y’all cheer for the cops for doing the right thing shows you and the cops have no empathy for black people. He had a family, a job, a life. He’s no angel, but is a sleeping on the Wendy’s drive through line a capital punishment offense? Is a taser a deadly weapon?"
"So after they failed to hold one man down and arrest him, he somehow took one of the officer’s NON-LETHAL weapon and run away while pointing a NON-LETHAL wepon, he deserves to be shot? if anything this video proves police need better training, specially mentally, they’re clearly not prepared to take decisions."
"We slide over for emergency vehicles all the time... We don’t automatically do it if traffic is built up, but when we hear the sirens, I can guarantee you we make room. To imply Americans don’t do this is a false narrative. This situation is different cause not only is their a massive amount of cars but also people that would have to move out of the way. This would slow them down significantly."
"It’s not about being productive or changing minds. It’s about forcing people to be confronted with the issue. A lot of people I know who don’t read the news religiously weren’t aware of his death before they set the Wendy’s on fire and blocked the freeway. Sure, they had their heads buried in the sand to not know about it when it happened, but many people in this country have their heads in the sand. Sometimes you need to cause a disruption to get the attention that you need for a cause."
"It's not about calling attention to the matter. Colin Keapernick, among millions of others over the last 150 years, called national attention to this matter clearly. Nothing was done about the regular lynchings.

This isn't about calling attention. It's about fucking over the society that refuses to stop the killing. That's right, the whole society, including you. Your attention was called long ago. Now it's punishment time."
Wait till you know they can get from the back
"You *do* realize that time is of the essence when it comes to an ambulance, right? 

I’ve seen enough people have trouble moving out of the way for an ambulance while driving, I can only imagine the problems they encounter while navigating through a traffic jam."
"In Germany and Austria last year they made it mandatory in a traffic jam for right lanes to shift right and the left lane to shift left, creating an artificial lane for first responders.

Edit:spellin"
"Traffic Jams aren't usually this bad, even with people getting out of the way it would still take them way too long to get through this. 

Also what if there was a pregnant lady in labor, or someone driving a friend to the hospital in serious condition because they couldn't afford an ambulance. This method of protest is incredibly selfish, it achieves nothing but pissing off 10000s of people, and dividing people more."
"Just because it is possible doesn't mean it's ideal. This is as if you said it's okay to block off emergency exits of a building, because people can just jump out the window if necessary.

Roads and railroads should never be blocked for no reason. People are frequently injured or killed in accidents induced by this kind situations."
And what about all the ambulances in front of the protest who now arrive at their victims 80% faster due to no traffic?
I root for motorists if people are attacking their car. I'd drive over someone if they were outside my car trying to smash the windows and threatening my safety with weapons and there was no way for me to get round.
"It's not that the ambulance can't get to where I needs to go, it's that it will now take significantly longer for it to get to where it needs to go, risking the life of someone in that ambulance."

"one thing that i dont understand is that, well, in pretty much the only country where you can get shot by police if you arent complying, you have all these people pushing their luck so damn hard like nowhere else."
The cop has already been fired and the chief of police was forced to retire.  I hope they sue the city.  Oh how the turntables ...
"Well the issue with it is that police argue day and night that their use of a taser is non-lethal. That tasers have little room for misconduct because they rarely result in death.

And if that's the case, aiming a taser at an officer cannot be construed as a lethal danger worthy to use lethal force. You can't have it both ways. Either a taser is lethal, in which case police use of a taser has to be put under further scrutiny, or it is non-lethal, in which case the officer shouldn't have used their lethal force to end the confrontation"
"no what happened is that he was running with a taser and he turned around to shoot at the cop, cop swerved and hit a parked car and dropped his taser while the guy continued running, then the cop shot him. This all happened in 2-3 seconds"
"He took the cops taser and fired at him. Cops view it as a death sentence to be rendered unconscious, and not without reason. Trying to incapacitate a cop is the same as trying to kill them"
"But I wouldn't be justified shooting a man running away from me in a Wendy's parking lot, unless that's the point you're making."
You’re not a police officer trying to apprehend a criminal. You don’t have the same powers and responsibilities of a police officer.
The officer who fired has already been terminated (due to political pressure from the Mayor). So he’s looking at a comfortable retirement cheque courtesy of the city.
"Well ""the powers"" just use their helicopters and private jets to get around so they're not affected"
"Not disruptive for families, disruptive for government officials and employees. That line of thought is exactly what's wrong and why rioting often ends up not working and turning most people deaf to a cause."

"It’s bizarre for me to. Almost 40 years in the US. The justifications for thinking it’s ok for police to kill is wild, if the dude took his GUN it might have been warranted but, he didn’t. Edit. To clarify my position. Cops should not have the authority to kill, justified or not. As a child I was taught they are “peace keepers” I have rarely seen that to be the case."
This. Thank you.
"I also agree on the fact that there are other methods to do that, but for me the problem in this kind of cases is that the victim is depicted as a saint that did nothing wrong and was killed just because of racism"
It’s bizarre to us too... there should never be a reason for a cop to murder someone. Why does being drunk and running from the cops mean you get to die? Why do the cops get to decide that?
Its strange for insiders too.
"Insiders too, mate. 

Can I come live with you?"
"Not trying to be a jerk or anything, what should they have done in this scenario? A man suddenly becomes violent after they are trying to arrest him for a DUI and he's clearly not safe to drive a vehicle. He fights off two officers, takes one of their tasers, is unaffected by the other taser and runs off. While he's running he turns around and slows down enough to point a weapon at your partner."
"Drinking and driving is like playing Russian roulette. Eventually someone innocent is going to die. In my opinion, the punishments for DUI are not tough enough."
"He literally stole the cops taser and pointed it at an officers face. If that officer doesn’t act, he could be incapacitated and have his firearm stolen by the drunk man. Drinking and driving isn’t a crime deserving of death, but threatening an officers safety/life is a completely different story."
Conveniently ignores the part where he tries to tase a cop that has a gun lol
"I understand your sentiment, but the man had PASSED OUT in the drive-thru lane because he had been drinking. They told him to pull into a parking space where he lost consciousness again. He had no idea where he was, and he failed the field sobriety test and breathalyzer. When they attempted to arrest him for DUI, he pulled away from the officers, fought them, took their tazer and ran away and tried to fire it at them. Was lethal force necessary, I can't say for sure. What I can say is that this is a situation that is very different from the murder of Tamir Rice, or the murder of George Floyd, or the murder of Breonna Taylor."
">How does that get escalated into a shooting

By failing a sobriety test, a breathalyser and then running at the point of arrest...being caught, fighting the officers and then grabbing their weapon. 

Hope this helped."
"He was asleep in his car in a drive thru... there are several videos of it. Pretty clear cut.

They did a sobriety test... he failed... he became violent when they went to arrest him. He was larger and stronger than both cops. He wrestled the gun away, began running... while running he turned and fired the tazer at the pursuing cop.

The escalation was on the dead man. The cops appeared to be arresting him in a very calm manner."
"Apparently he was in the drive-thru line when he fell asleep. So they conducted a sobriety test which he failed, so they placed him under arrest. He resisted and assaulted the officers, grabbed the taser and fired it toward them. Officer retaliated and that's what they've said happened. There's surveillance footage from the Wendy's, a bystander, and the [body cam ](https://youtu.be/KT01znN_PiU)."
You had me in the first half. Not gonna lie.

They probably would be shot of placed in the same situation yes
"Did you misunderstand what they were saying? They’re saying when events like the video happen, Americans don’t organize well."
Getting attention for the cause is great. Getting attention like this makes people less likely to support the cause.
But it also has unintended consequences of forcing people to chose a side. And not everyone is going to pick the side they want
"Drunk guy resisted arrest, assaulted cop, stole cops taser and shot it at the cop.

The cop shot him. 

There’s a lot of great examples of police brutality. This doesn’t appear to be one of them.

IMO"
Then you can’t really be upset at people when they’re annoyed by your disruption can you?  If the goal is to purposely disrupt people and make their day difficult then those people being blocked have every right to be angry at those blocking the road
"This is not the cause you want to bring attention to. It was a drunk guy who punched a cop while resisting arrest, stole his taser, and shot his partner with it.

So you're making people wait for hours because you're defending violent drunken mess.

I support BLM mostly, but it's shit like this that makes me question that support."
"It's true that you can't raise awareness of an issue without a disruption to the public, but not all disruptions are counter productive. You can raise awareness by making a huge beautiful mural, or starting a community center in their honor, or by using a billboard.

Blocking a road is going to net some attention to your cause because news stations report things that make people angry, and hindering the innocent public makes people angry. Now when they hear your cause the first thing they'll think is ""oh, the people that jammed an entire freeway"", assuming no one died as a result."
"Yeah it seems to me that its much more effective to take these strategies, and do it in a more targeted way like those videos of people protesting in front of corrupt or indifferent political figures houses and inconveniencing then directly."
You realize that’s the point right? What’s the point of a protest if it doesn’t inconvenience people?

So... Yes?"
Right. So he was shot in the back.
"We cannot justifiably shoot a cop acting unlawfully despite them having a deadly weapon, so I would say it is only fair the same standard applies in reverse."
You would if he pointed a taser at you. Because then he could incapacitate you and take your lethal weapon.
Hopefully he sues or something. I feel bad for the guy. They seemed like very professional people
"Which he deserves, he did nothing wrong in this situation and literally begged the man to stop what he was doing. This was not racism nor police brutality and a man's life was ruined by a mayor who was quick to throw one of his officers under the bus without information. Would it be better if the man was alive? Sure, but unlike the other real police brutality cases, this man was VERY clearly resisting arrest, as well as stealing an officer's weapon AND he then proceeded to fire it at him. And for those who will say that 'it was just a taser', Tasers are still considered *Lethal* weapons, albeit less lethal, but lethal nonetheless."
"Funny, right? When it exonerates them the body cam is perfect. When it shows them killing someone, it disappears or it's almost impossible to get from them."
Where is the Floyd arrest body cam footage?? Hmm
I'm an American and I also find it really bizarre. Some people here are unbelievably rigid in their thinking when it comes to the law and police. It can be frightening at times.

"choice 1: keep chasing him. a taser isnt deadly and you have to reload it after each time you fire it. so even if he does tase your partner, after that he's just an unarmed drunk guy.

choice 2: let him go and check on your partner. hes not a dangerous maniac hes just a drunk guy and you already have all his information, you can pick him up later. last resort should be shooting the guy imo."
He wasn't armed with a gun. He ain't scaping if he's drunk. Get more back up and a chopper. Or chase after him. Cops are supposed to be trained for dangerous situations and not panick immediately. Id understand a civilian reacting like this (shooting the person) But not a cop
"The weapon which he took from the officers which they used on him twice but didn’t work? I still don’t think you shoot him dead.

I have no idea why the taser didn’t work. I wonder if the cops used it right. They’re not really the best trained force out there are they?

Maybe the fucked it up.

Regardless, call for more backup, consider other physical restraints, have cops carry tranquilizer darts I don’t fucking know. This isn’t judge dredd where cops should be straight killing people who pose these kinds of threats.

Besides, given how cops treat black and brown people, I don’t know how well they handled it to start with.

I’m not saying this guy is innocent. He should’ve been taken to jail, and he should’ve seen his day in court, and he should’ve paid his debt to society.

His debt to society is not his life. Consider how much thought and time and money goes into giving the death penalty.

Some random cop gave this man that same penalty. How does that not worry you?"
Yeah a competent officer would have been able to handle that. It's unfortunate that most American cops receive such terrible training. that would have resulted in this cop not being a murderer for the rest of his life. Unfortunately I don't think any jury will take your excuse at face value.
"He started to run.

Let him run.

If only his car was left behind at the scene that you could identify him and issue an arrest warrant for him later.

He drove drunk. He isn't a murderer on the loose. Let him go and get him later.

*Americans: NAHH SHOOT THE BASTARD*"
"So its non leathal for cops to tase people? But when a cop is going to be tased its leathal?

Good critcal thinking skills bro."
"So you can see in the surveillance video he definitely fired the taser and appears to miss, what is the threat at that point? Correct me if I'm wrong but is the taser not one shot and then require a reload? If so, there was not a threat from the guy as he is running on foot away from the cop. This is a tough one."
"Like you conveniently ignoring the fact that officers own police chief disagreed with his actions too, and resigned.

Americans who think people should be shot for literally any crime lmao."
"There are 2 cops there, even if he successfully tasered the one cop there's no fucking way he would have time to go to his body and grab the gun and shoot that other cop. Yeah this guy is a fucking idiot but could have 100% not been shot in the back."
Did you ever stop to think that a taser was also not warranted in this scenario?
"I mean, if tasing is the threshold, then a lot of cops should be dead by now no?

Or does the logic only work one way?"
"Neither is the media refusing to cover the PEACEFUL protests. It also didn't help when the country boo-hoo'd about Collin Kaepernick's knee. 

THE REAL LOOTING IS THE BILLIONS TAKEN BY WALL STREET IN STIMULUS MONEY WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO SMALL BUSINESSES.

True. I love how people are shaming others and calling them racist for being against the looting and burning of property. People are actually insane
There’s no correct way to protest. If it was perfectly correct it wouldn’t be called protesting.
"Neither has voting nor peaceful protests. As history shows, if you don't listen, people will get violent."

"Have you ever had that intrusive diarrhea, the one where you literally feel shit pushing up against your anus and becoming squeezed by the pressure from about a kilo more shot right behind and the pure muscular effort of your anus to keep it inside.

I mean the diarrhea where the muscles of your anus start to feel like you just pulled off a 2h training session exceeding your usual weights and you're in the middle of your last pushups. All your brain can think of is 'I CANT. I HAVE NO MUSCULAR POWER ANYMORE' and your arms start to jitter and you keep pushing and pushing but you suddenly realize your muscles start to loosen. I'm talking about the diarrhea where your anus feels exactly this way - but you can't just stop and loosen the door to the apocalyptically slurry in-car massacre. You can't.

And you sit there, in your car, in a traffic jam. The whole exit area of your internals starts to hurt, you start to think: What if my anus is strong enough, but my gut wall isn't? Can it rupture? I mean that would be instant death - and even if not, there's no way ambulance can get through to me. Negative thoughts intrude you while everyone in your lower parts forcefully and painfully request to exit your body. So fucking much pressure on your whole body. And. You. Can't. Do. SHIT.

So, no, I do not believe counting to 500 would have rescued me."

"""YOU FORGOT THE BRIEFCASE!"""
"So then it’s ok to shoot him dead? How is that justifiable? I get it, he resisted, tased the cop, but that does not justify the cop shooting him? How can you possibly assume that"
I remember watching a cop run after a peaceful protester with a taser in Seattle the other day and shot at and missed him twice with it. Does that mean it’d be justified to shoot the cop? Hmmm
It has one bullet...
Bro it's clear as day in the video. You're deluded.
"You can't shoot people in the back you massive dipshit/asshole. You have to legitimately be fearing for your life, not just executing someone who stole your taser"
"The dude had a taser, which he wrestled away from them, and which they used on him multiple times. He should’ve been arrested for sure, he should’ve seen his day in court.

Instead he’s dead.

How is it so difficult for you to recognize the problem? No one is suggesting this man is the same as say, George Floyd or Eric garner or philando Castile.

But the concept is the same: police react by straight up killing black people in these situations because they view black people as an inherent significant threat.

Dude is dead. Do you really have no concern about that?"
"Your first comment was fine.  Attempting to flee, no.  He fired the stolen taser at the officer.  The next attempt to grapple with him could lead to a stolen gun and then what next?  I suppose they could have let him go and got him later.  

But let's be honest here, why the fuck was Brooks passed out behind the wheel in the line at a Wendy's after admittedly drinking prior to?  We're just supposed to let him get blackout drunk and drive around all over the place just because he's black?  And when they go crazy and start fighting when the cops temporarily cuff them for breathalyzer, we're just suppose to let them go on a rampage while they run off with a stolen weapon? 

Some of these guys invite this trouble and although they don't deserve to die the question ""what the fuck were they doing there in the first place"" never gets asked because it's now some sort of taboo even though it's a completely rational question to consider.  

It's not all race-related.  It's fucking poverty culture, even if the victim has money, it's still poverty culture."
"""attempting to flee justifies lethal force"" ok bud"
If waiting in traffic makes you decide that systemic racism and/or police brutality doesn't exist then they're part of the problem.
"If being inconvenienced for a few hours is going to make someone go 'hm, maybe I DO agree with black people being murdered by cops' then I'm guessing they weren't ever super likely to support the cause to begin with."
Most people arnt going to pick the side of the people who pissed them off and ruined their day. Seriously people will even act against their own interests if they feel like the are standing up against people they dislike.
If you're more outraged by being stuck on the highway than systemic racism I feel like you've already picked a side.
Doing nothing is already picking the other side.
"Yeah this feels like control to me. Which, we definitely live in a control freak world so this shouldn't be a surprise. You can't force someone to see that the cop shouldn't have used his gun to protect himself in a violent situation. Some people think and feel it was necessary, some people don't. Let's not lock down a major highway over it tho"
"Good. American society has been waging war against the black community for hundreds of years. We need to know exactly what side you're on now, because the time has come to wage war back on those who have been supporting, actively or passively, the war against black America."
Did he shoot the taser at the cop? The articles I read said he was running away when they shot at him.
"He was running away. After what I've seen on live TV in the past few weeks, I can't blame the man for grabbing that taser. Because the police kill unarmed people. They hurt unarmed people. Fuck, maybe he thought it would give him a chance to evade death, because it's not about evading arrest anymore. You comply, you still die. Doesn't matter. If they don't play fair, why should we?

It's not a routine stop. It never has been. And he died. He died running away. They had no right to kill him."
"A cop might have been tased. That justifies this killing?

Do you think a white guy doing the same thing would have been killed? I sincerely doubt it. This is a perfect example of excessive force and should not have happened. Rayshard should currently be awaiting his day in court. He should not be dead."
But but but HE WAS ALWAYS SUCH A GOOD GUY NEVER HURT ANYONE AT ALL.
"If you really think the guy deserved to die for that, there's something wrong with you."
"Research has found that direct action like this has historically forced local and national government to develop socially progressive and positive policy very quickly. 

Many freedoms and rights you enjoy today will have been won by highly disruptive direct action (like this) over the past 200 years.

While you might enrage a ton of individuals in the short term by disrupting their daily lives – or even put some lives in danger – it sends a message to officials and authorities that something needs to change."
"I’ll get downvoted every time, but that’s my argument against burning and looting as well. Or the CHAZ. Instead of bringing attention to their cause, you’re enforcing people who don’t follow or weren’t sure to begin with that police are in fact needed and necessary for everyone’s safety"
"Good. Calling attention to the problem obviously doesn't work. Over and over attention is called and not enough people stand up and say, ""Enough"" The time has come to shut down this killer society, or at least cripple it, whether ""they"" like it or not."
"The older folks at work always laugh when us younger folks say we use waze to get everywhere, even if we know how to get there. It's not about needing to be told how to get somewhere, it's needing to be told when to change course sooner rather than later. Once you pass that last open exit and get stuck in traffic, knowing the backroads won't get you anywhere because you can't move."
This guy Atlantas.
i gave that explanation because that guy seems to think he was just shot in the back because he running.
It won't matter to the people protesting.
"The bodycam footage that I’ve seen is very respectful and courteous. The only criticism I would have is potentially he should’ve said to him before moving to grab his arm “I am going to have to place you under arrest”...

I will be curious to watch this case in particular develop on both sides. I hope the officer can sue for unfair dismissal. But I am also curious as to why Brooks resisted, I suspect there’s more to his story than we are lead to believe."
They’ve already burned that exact Wendy’s down last night.
It's almost like they're different police departments.
It's exemplified by the morons blocking a highway treating him like a martyr just like they did with Michael brown. Another crook who is better off dead.
"Imagine grabbing an armed security guards taser, then rubbing from him while trying to shoot him with it. I can't. It takes a special level of stupid to do that shit. 

If that guard shot you he would be acquitted acting in self defense."
The tasing isn't the threshold. It's the tasing then possibly lifting the gun part.
"But the good ones let it happen, so they’re also bad apples."
The public doesn't see it that way. They don't see a group of protesters with a few rioters. They see a group of rioters. Same for the police.
A few bad apples spoils the bunch is the actual saying.
"Pfffffft 

That's what you think.  I just wrote a very persuasive letter to the President of the United States, ever heard of him?

I agree. People keep saying “well it’s so inconvenient for them to shut down a highway or block the street”. It’s like no s**t. That’s the point. It’s supposed to be inconvenient and piss people off. Because that’s how it ends up alllllll over the media. That’s how you actually get people aware of things.
A lot of people are using protests as an excuse to loot. They don't want or care about change. If you told them they were making things worse they wouldn't care. I am all for fixing the police but this is not how you do it. Granted I do not know how you do it just that this is how you don't.

They're nice but I hate that they stick to the roll.  You need 2 hands and it slows me down when I'm on a roll with cleaning or whatever
"Tell me, what would your response be when someone grabs one of your 2 forms of self defense, runs away and shoots it at you? Especially with all this anti-cop rhetoric and violence against cops going on.
 You would just say “Aweh shit, time to roll over and chill out?”

No, In the moment you have adrenaline rushing, you think “he took one of my weapons and is aiming it at me, about to try and taze me.” And you go into self defense mode.... for all we know, he could’ve tazed the officer, and then ran over and taken the officers handgun too."
"The justification for shooting him was when he attempted to use the taser on the officer, if that were to have been successful and the officer was incapacitated from it he could lose his gun. In the past Supreme Court cases such as Tennessee v. Garner have decided lethal force is justified if it’s to stop a fleeing felon that would pose harm to the officer or public. When he fired that taser he posed harm to the officer, and some may argue that he posed a danger to the public by driving under the influence (while technically not a felony, I think it would be boosted up to a higher charge after what took place)."
He stole a taser and turned around to shoot at the officers watch the video
"Not all Americans, some are just suuuuuper special like that. we call em bootlickers"
"Exactly my point.  Look at the vast majority of republican voters in poor states. They actively vote against their own interests on things that actually affect their lives(medical care, social assistance programs) because Murica, guns and the gays shouldn't marry cuz the bible said so"
Get a load of this correct opinion.
"If your outraged because you have obligations to pick a kid up from daycare on time, or to care for disabled family member, or you have to get to your insulin and time....and you *can't* - I can understand being outraged. I can even understand how that makes people predisposed to siding with the wrong side here.

And that's the picture that the media paints when people do things like this. It's unfair to the vast majority of other protesters that are able to protest peacefully without cutting off major, vital roads like this. It's unfair to the protesters that don't feel the need to light businesses on fire.

I hate Fox news, so I'd really appreciate it if people stopped serving them these kinds of dividing examples on a silver platter."
"I would wager the vast majority of white americans don't ever think about it.  From conversations I've had with people if it's not something that affects their daily lives they just don't think about it.  But when something happens to inconvenience you, a lot of people don't react well to that unfortunately."
"So congratulations, you've now turned a bunch of passive racists into active racists.

Was that the intended goal?

The protesters are shooting themselves in the foot. They are drawing hatred and validating those who already hated them.

This isn't how you win. At all."
Americans are so racist they elected a black president!  Twice!
That's literally not what he said. He's just pointing out hitching your outrage wagon to this particular criminal horse might not be the way to go.
"Fleeing from an violent crime, like assault, can legally get you shot according to Tenn v Garner.

I agree it could have been perfectly viable not to use lethal force, but I can understand that it happened."
There's a difference between thinking someone deserves to die and a cop being justified in defending themselves from someone attacking them with their stolen weapon.
"Certain activities carry risks, the police didn’t go there with the intent of shooting this guy for driving drunk"
Can you source your research?
"Or, you know, knowing where cops and other hazards are so I can keep going 95 in the left lane."
that’s what happened
He was. You mentioned what he was doing before he was running.
"LOL Of course ""they"" did."
"With your disregard for human life I’d say it might be you who’s better off dead, for the rest of us."
So no concrete evidence? Blocking off a highway doesn't mean people think he's a saint.
"Such callous disregard for human life you have. No one is claiming this guy was a saint, but he deserved to die? He has a daughter at home."
No it’s a nod to what people say about the police
He was mocking that they say thst about the police

"We are getting downvoted because we’re making too much sense.

You know, I remember this guy that I served time with telling me a story about how him and his crew used to hit delivery trucks and steal everything on it. And the way that they would get away is by like calling in a bomb threat or a gun at a school for some crazy ass fucking threat not on the other side of town but just a few blocks away from where they were at because that way the cops that would actually be Responding to where he is it would be busy versus the cops on the other side of town which would probably be a different precinct 

This is essentially the same thing.


Wow the police are more worried about dispersing the actual protesting patriots who give a fuck about their country and their community the criminals are able to roam free and steal all kinds of shit that they don’t need. And by the time the cops ever do get there, they are fucking gone."

"So you can sympathize with the scared cops but not with the man who has repeatedly seen black men killed by police with no consequence. 

In the moment you have adrenaline rushing, you’re drunk, you think “he took out a weapon and is aiming it at me, about to try to tase me” and you go into self defense mode.... for all we know... wait, we already know, they fucking killed him. 

He was not acting violent when police were called, he was asleep in his car. There was no reason for armed officers at the scene. This is why we need to divide up police duties.  This night would have gone differently if first responders were trained in anything more than escalation and violence."
"A taser is not a fucking weapon. You don’t need to defend yourself from a taser by killing someone. There’s no reason to shoot, the other police officer chased him with a taser and not a gun. The one that lost his taser felt so small and insignificant without something in his hand that he had to pull out a gun. 

Think about it this way, they had his information, they had his car, THEY HAD HIM ON CAMERA. They could have easily just put out an APB and be done with it, arrested him a day later or the night of."
You literally used an example that didn't help your point?
"Shooting a non lethal taser round at two well protected officers, is justification for deadly force? By your logic the protests going on around the usa should be an absolute blood bath right now."
He shot a taser. They were not in danger.
then what are we supposed to do huh? america hasn't listen for YEARS and you expect us to keep protesting just outside at parks. fuck that.

"Right, that’s a bonus too."
"okay story time- A bank robber tries to rob a bank but fails. The police comes and he shoots at them and tries to flee but the police shoot him in the back. Was he shot because he was just running away? no, he was shot because he was trying to kill the police.

Same thing happened here. Although the taser wouldnt have killed them, it was still dangerous because if they had been incapacitated, he could have stolen their gun. Though this enters the realm of ""what ifs"".

I guess the argument that the police should not have shot him is kind of correct, but i feel this shooting is legally justified"
"No he was running, and then turned and pointed the taser at the police, and then that's when the other cop opened fire."
He was running and fired the taser while running away and looking back. He was then shot a split second later. Just go watch the damn video.

"Well, considering the officer took out the taser AFTER the man resisted arrest and started to actively combat the officers, so your entire argument is kind of.... invalid?"
Did you watch the video at all? The only person who escalated anything was Rayshard. Rayshard instigated the violence.
"A taser is a single use weapon.

Since it was already used it's now less dangerous than a rock."
You can’t fight police steal their weapons shoot at them and then try to run away
Why are you making comments about how he is being treated like a Saint when you have zero basis for that?
We dont want cops to be public executioners. That guy isn't a saint and frankly we don't give a fuck what he was doing. We just want people to have due process like they are supposed to have. He pointed a taser at a cop. That shouldn't be a death sentence.
"Between tomorrow and Tuesday you’ll see at least three or four black business owners crying on TV that they’re very own community did this to them.

And no one will give a fuck.


They’d rather give a fuck about some drunk who is putting peoples lives in danger but decided that it was an OK idea to fight the cops and steal their Tayser and point it at them."

But it doesn’t matter. Somebody with an open mind and some common sense will see it and maybe it will help"
"Me too. By pushing our limits, only then we can achieve our full potential"
"Arrested, not shot and killed."
"Yep, so let's kill him.  Even though he's currently not posing an immediate threat to anybody's life, let's make police the judge, jury, and executioner and fucking kill him."
"While using a taser against a cop shouldn't be a death sentence, the taser did indeed still have a charge left, as you can hear it fire when rayshard turns around on the cop. Atlanta uses axom tasers and axoms newest model is the x2 which has a backup shot."
"You are right, but that doesn’t mean you escalate the situation by killing a person with a taser. This one is a hard one because the guy is an absolute piece of shit who was driving drunk, fighting the cops and stole one of the cops tasers and shot the taser at them but I don’t think you shoot a guy using a taser when there are multiple officers at the scene. 

If there was a cop by himself and that happened then I would say it’s completely justified due to the fact the cop could become incapacitated and he could take his gun but I’m not sure him doing that with multiple officers is anywhere near the same threat. The only thing I could say in favor of the officers case is that he already fought both of them at once and they still couldn’t stop him so maybe he could have incapacitated the first officer and easily fought off the second for the first officer’s gun but it never got to that point."
"The businesses will of course be insured, meanwhile the police once again decided to skip the judge and jury part of law and order. When police use their tasers it’s non lethal, when a black guy takes one it’s an excuse to end his life."
I get downvoted just about everytime I post unless it's about my car. We can hope it will help someone. But sadly I doubt it. It is Reddit. A lot of people are going to learn the hard way that this isn't real life and I hope it stings.
So I have a gun on me we are fighting I take your self defense weapon and use it on you I’m not an immediate threat to your life? Not to mention he had a real gun and was brandishing it at people in the parking lot is that not an immediate threat to their lives? One trigger pull seems pretty immediate to me.
"I agree with everything you said, but cops aren’t just robots.

Imagine you are in that position, someone fights you, steals one of your forms of defense, and then fires at you. 

Even if you realize it’s your taser, by this point you’ve already drawn your gun out.

Does your first instinct give you the time to rationally weigh out “ok, I have other allies around me that can prevent the suspect from over taking me if I am incapacitated” or do you just fire to eliminate the possible risk to your life.

It’s easy to analyze this after the fact, but in a split second decision, there’s only so much information you can possibly take in."
"I agree with most of what you said but the officers are not the ones the escalated the situation. Fighting with officers gets you slammed on the floor, stealing their weapon and discharging it gets you shot"
What do you mean of course be insured? When you try to fight the police there are risks. One of them is dying. He made the decision. They wanted to take him to jail. He wanted otherwise. He ended his own life. It was avoidable. You would think with everything in the news people would be extra cautious not extra reckless. FYI defending yourself doesn't make you judge and jury.
"The businesses are insured. Most of them. 

But the paychecks of the people who are not going to have a job to go to are not going to be insured. 

No one seems to think about these people when they burn these places down. 

They only think of some conglomerate that doesn’t have a human entity behind it"
